# Pacific Observatory

The Pacific Observatory is the World Bank analytical program to explore and develop new information sources to mitigate the impact of data gaps in official statistics for Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Pacific Island Countries (PICs).

This repository hosts the team's efforts to investigate how alternative data sources can be used to generate economic and sector statistics through cost-effective methods. The goal is to assess whether new data sources can produce indicators that are timely, have higher frequency and granularity.

The content is structured by topic of investigation, each thematic folder contains code, notebooks, outputs, and technical notes.

## Research Topics

ðŸ”– [**Night Time Lights Applications**](./ch1_lights.md)
> This sections explores socio-economic applications with Night Time Lights data.  
Are lights at night a good proxy for economic activity?  
Can lights be used to aid poverty mapping, estimate access to electrification, or examine recovery from disasters or pandemic impacts?

ðŸ”– **Market Prices Imputation**
> This section introduces a machine learning imputation method to fill gaps in food prices from markets in Papua New Guinea.

ðŸ”– **Automatic Identification System (AIS)**
> This section assess the feasibility of using AIS data to derive high-frequency and geospatially disaggregated indicators on fisheries and trade.

ðŸ”– **Crop Mapping / Climate Indices**
> Creating new crop masks with limited training data and satellite imagery.  
> Developing a sub-national database of climate indicators.

ðŸ”– **Aviation Statistics**

ðŸ”– **Text Mining**
