Tuvalu has a permanent population of about 11,000 people. In return, Australia will have effective veto power over Tuvalu's security arrangements with any other country.""With the Pacific the best placed to support the Pacific's own security, Australia and Tuvalu will also mutually agree cooperation with other countries in Tuvalu's security sectors,"" the agreement reads.   The agreement comes as Tuvalu's viability is threatened by rising sea levels as climate change escalates, with the country flagging a potential move into the digital world. ""As a low-lying nation it is particularly impacted by climate change,"" Mr Albanese said at a press conference on Friday. ""Its very existence is threatened. I believe developed nations have a responsibility to provide assistance and that is precisely what we are doing.""[This is] the most significant agreement between Australia and a Pacific island nation ever."" Mr Natano described the deal as a ""beacon of hope"". ""It's not just a milestone but a giant leap forward in our joint mission to ensure regional stability, sustainability and prosperity,"" he said. It is the first time that a Pacific Island nation has agreed to such an intimate relationship with Australia – and the first time that Australia has offered residence or citizenship rights to foreign nationals because of the threat posed by climate change.Anna Powles, a Pacific expert and senior lecturer in defence and security at Massey University, told the ABC the agreement happened ""at speed and under immense secrecy"". ""It is hugely significant,"" she said. ""It comes at a time when the sentiment for self-determination — and Pacific-led priorities and agendas — is at an all time high [and] this agreement would appear to be counter to some of these sentiments.""She said the treaty would provide a model that some smaller Pacific countries also threatened by climate change, such as Nauru and Kiribati, may be encouraged to consider.  ""However, it does not create a pathway for other [larger Pacific] countries.""Mr Albanese and Mr Natano met earlier this week on the sidelines of the Pacific Islands Forum where they discussed Tuvalu's plan to adapt to climate change — but neither country flagged this agreement after that meeting.There are already several independent Pacific states that have associations or ""compacts"" with larger outside countries.Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Marshall Islands all have a Compact of Free Association with the United States, giving Washington authority over their defence issues in return for US government services and the right to live in the US.Similarly, New Zealand has arrangements with Niue and Cook Islands, which gives Wellington responsibility for their defence.Mr Albanese was in Cook Islands this week to participate in the Pacific Islands Forum — the region's biggest and most important annual meeting. Australia's role in the region, and the fact it continues to expand its coal and gas industries as the world approaches a climate tipping point, was seen as motivation by some Pacific watchers for Mr Albanese to come armed with climate-focused announcements, such as the Tuvalu agreement.Some expected Mr Albanese to announce a climate change fund for the region at the Forum, but Mr Albanese on Friday said he'd make ""further announcements"" at an appropriate time.      Speaking after the Tuvalu agreement was announced, Greens leader Adam Bandt said Labor must ""accept responsibility"" for the ""damage it is causing to places like Tuvalu for backing more coal and gas"". ""It would be even better if Labor didn’t cause the damage in the first place and stopped approving new coal and gas mines,"" he said. ","Australia, Climate Change, Cook Islands, Defence and National Security, Environment, Federal Government, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Immigration, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Federated States Of, New Zealand, Niue, Pacific, Tuvalu, United States, World Politics, ",2023-11-10 04:42:15+00:00

It also has a small Muslim population of about 7 per cent, and a tiny Jewish population.   But despite the small population, its connection to Israel is strong. Fiji has long been one of the largest contributors of soldiers to UN peacekeeping missions in the Middle East region, and has a developing economic relationship with Israel.        Yet Reverend James Bhagwan, general-secretary of the Pacific Conference of Churches, told the ABC's Pacific Beat program Fiji's vote to side with Israel was a ""contradiction"".""How can we say we are working towards a region of peace when this humanitarian call for a ceasefire is voted against?"" he told the ABC's Pacific Beat program.On Israel, Dr Newton-Cain said it had been a ""small but quite significant actor"" in the Pacific region for quite a while. ""There's no question that Israel, or possibly the US, has sought to influence voting in the region,"" she said. ""And as we've seen, it's been successful in some cases and less so in others."" Tonga is another country that has a longstanding, and increasingly active, relationship with the US. Its Prime Minister, Siaosi Sovaleni, was asked this week whether its decision was made ""to impress"" aid donors such as the United States. ""We are not trying to impress anyone,"" he said. ""This was a sovereign decision made by the government of Tonga.""Dr Newton-Cain said on top of the geopolitical landscape there was no doubt the religious element — and Israel's increased engagement in the region — played a part in voting lines. ""We saw Papua New Guinea [last month] open an embassy in Jerusalem rather than Tel Aviv, and some of that is informed by quite Old Testament religious thinking,"" she said. ""There is a sense, including at the personal leadership level, a sense that supporting Israel is the right thing to do from a religious point of view, particularly if people's religious viewpoints are informed by that kind of Old Testament, Holy Land, way of thinking.""Dr Newton-Cain said that for some nations, part of supporting Israel was part of protecting the Holy Land.""As we know, people's religious views are very important in the Pacific,"" she said.In the early stages of the war in Gaza, hundreds of Pacific pilgrims were in Israel for the Feast of Tabernacles, with some of them part of the Australian government repatriation flights. Many were Solomon Islanders from the region of northern Malaita, where some communities subscribe to the theory that Malaitans descended from Hebrews.The connection was explored in a research paper written by former bishop Terry Brown, and published by the University of Trinity College of Toronto. In it, Mr Brown explores the ""intimate relationship"" with Jews, the Old Testament and the modern state of Israel with Solomon Islanders in the region. In the research, Mr Brown delves into the ""visions and teachings"" of Anglican leader George Umai, from northern Malaita, who led a lot of the theorising in the region. ""In his prophecies, Umai traced Malaitans, Solomon Islanders, and many other Oceanic peoples to his ancestors who he claimed fled from Jerusalem to Malaita,"" he wrote. ""According to Umai, they brought the Ark of the Covenant from the Jerusalem Temple to Kwara'ae, Malaita where they buried it."" Mr Umai died in 1998. But the connection to Israel continues today, with the Israeli flag a common sight in the province. Academic research has also been conducted into the theory that Fijians are part of a lost tribe of Israel. Anthropologist Lynda Newland wrote a paper on the genesis of the theory, which stems from what's known as the Kaunitoni Migration, which tells the story — first published in Western research in 1890 — about how three chiefs came ""from the West"" to Fiji's main two islands and beyond.  She writes: ""Over the course of the 20th Century, the narrative has been elaborated to claim Fijian origins in Lake Tanganyika in Eastern Afrika and the other more ancient connections with the Middle East.""Some also claim the Ark of the Covenant is buried on Mana Island, west of Nadi, while others say their forefathers had the ""covenant of circumcision"" when missionaries arrived and early Fijians had Egyptian wives.For Mika Mudreilagi, it is something he believes as part of his strong faith, but admits it's something researchers need to explore more.""It's a sign of our affiliation, of where the roots of our faith came from,"" he said. ""I would like the International Christian Embassy of Jerusalem to come here and look into it more. I think it's an important area to look into. ""But regardless, we are bound to Israel, [our hearts] are tied with Israel.""","Asia, Fiji, History, Israel, Judaism, Malaita, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Nauru, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Religion, Solomon Islands, Tonga, World Politics, ",2023-11-03 20:09:54+00:00

So basically, China is doing more with less.""And while donors committed a record-breaking $5.5 billion to the region in 2021, Mr Dayant said that sum was still short of what the Pacific needed.""This is still far from what the region needs in terms of funding — not just for classic development purposes, but also the negative consequence of climate change,"" he said.The Pacific Aid Map shows a sharp jump in finance for climate change-related projects, but Mr Dayant said many of them had only a loose connection to climate.""Funding for projects which really focus on climate mitigation and adaptation is actually pretty flat,"" he said.""More is needed in this space.

It's been moving and all of our contributors, what they've told us is, 'Melissa, if you didn't have this project a lot of our practices would have died',"" the Fijian and Tongan woman said.The exhibition was curated by Pacific Islanders and houses artefacts of deep cultural significance for the diaspora in Australia.Pasifika exhibitions have long been curated through a Western anthropological lens, which the museum aims to counter with the close involvement of traditional knowledge holders.""This is very different because it's the first time that a group of all Pacific staff, plus Pacific contributors, a curatorium, have come together to feed into it and build it up from the bottom up,"" Ms Malu said.She said Pacific communities in Australia and the region were engaged to find out exactly how they would like their culture and stories told in a museum.The result is an intriguing collection of historic and contemporary artefacts.Among the artefacts is a royal suru, a traditional headdress worn in battle by kings of Fiji's Rotuman people. Rotuman artist Letila Mitchell led the extensive process to recreate the headdress, which was last made when the Rotuma islands' royals were abolished over a thousand years ago.""There is no physical replica anywhere in the world that we've found so far,"" she said.While the practice of crafting the royal headdress stopped, the technique of how to make the suru was passed down through generations of knowledge keepers.""It took us a couple of years to do the research around this, to find a knowledge keeper who retained the knowledge on how to make it and what the materials are from,"" Ms Mitchell said.""His message to us was that he was waiting for young people to come and to say that his wisdom and his knowledge was relevant.""While the exhibition explores the past, it also dives into the contemporary histories of Pacific Islanders.The centrepiece of the exhibition is a vaka, a type of canoe carved out from a Kanava tree in Tokelau.Tokelau is a remote dependent territory of New Zealand about halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand.The traditional canoes were used in a 2014 blockade of Newcastle Harbour where Pacific climate activists disrupted coal shipments.The vaka's central presence in the gallery gives visitors a sense of foreboding, according to co-curator Taofia Pelesasa.""It's a part of the Australian Pacific climate change narrative and having it where it is in the gallery shows that wherever you are in this gallery, climate change is stored in your peripheral no matter what,"" he said.Mr Taofia, a Tokelauan Samoan, said it was important to exhibit contemporary artefacts because it ""changes what we believe the museum to be"".""From a Pacific perspective, it's [museums] where you go to see things that don't exist anymore, but Pacific culture is very much still alive and breathing,"" he said.""So having this [canoe] alongside ancient artefacts from almost 200 years ago, it's a reminder that our narrative continues and never ended, and that we're not dead yet.""We're still here, we're still breathing.""Another display featuring contemporary artefacts is dedicated to South Sea Islanders, the descendants of Pacific Islanders who were brought to Australia as indentured labourers between 1863 and 1904 in a practice known as blackbirding.These labourers, from some 80 different Pacific islands, lost touch with their cultural heritage and have forged a unique identity over the last 160 years, according to South Sea Islander artist Jasmin Togo-Brisby.""We don't have that tangible culture. We don't have a lot of those [cultural] performances and so for me as an artist, it's about using materials which my community can see themselves within,"" she said.Crow feathers are prominent in Togo-Brisby's work reflecting an intrinsic part of the Queensland landscape where her ancestors worked on sugar plantations in slave-like conditions.""This is what happened, it's a huge part of the Pacific narrative, which is just not talked about enough,"" she said.The Australian Museum is running outreach programs to invite the Pacific diaspora, particularly young people, into the exhibition to connect with their culture.""Many of them have grown up not knowing the language, not being able to connect to their cultures,"" Ms Malu said.Wansolmoana Connect is the museum's main initiative aiming to build confidence and a sense of belonging in Pasifika youth from western and south-western Sydney, where a large diaspora is based.""We would like to bring them back here, reconnect them because there's so much beauty in our cultures and a lot of this was built around the different values of respect, reciprocity, love, sharing, and all of that,"" Ms Malu said.""Come and see our heritage that's been kept very well here and come and share with us, you may have some stories that we could use too and we could spark up new projects and ideas.""Members of the Pacific community said they felt pride seeing their culture on display at the museum.""It's really important to me to see our institutions investing in our people, and especially our young people,"" Tongan Australian Sēini F Taumoepeau said.Filipo Junior Vanikai Filipo, a Tokeleaun Samoan who lives in Mount Druitt, said it was important for minorities to see their culture in the museum.""For our younger generation now to be able to walk into the museum and to see that and to reconnect back to the history and stories — it means the world,"" he said.","Art, Art History, Arts, Culture and Entertainment, Climate Change, Community and Society, Contemporary Art, Environment, Fiji, French Polynesia, History, Indigenous (Other Peoples), Kiribati, Libraries, Museums and Galleries, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Pacific, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Sydney, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Water, World Politics, ",2023-10-27 19:25:48+00:00
4,https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2023-10-24/marshall-islands-fresh-water-catchment-storage-airport-lens/102944572,"Tuvuki Ketedromo has known how precious water is since he was a kid.  In the late 1990s, he and his family were living in the Marshall Islands' capital, Majuro, when a drought hit the Pacific nation, causing a severe shortage of fresh water.Tanks ran dry, and mains water was turned on for just a few hours each week.In a state of emergency, the government provided limited volumes of fresh water, either pumped from a rapidly depleting groundwater source or produced by reverse-osmosis systems, which filtered salt and other substances out of seawater.""I remember going out to collect gallons of water with my mum and brothers,"" Mr Ketedromo says.""We'd walk out, fill up our two containers each, one in each hand, then come back home.""This went on for months before the drought finally broke in mid-1998.Mr Ketedromo still lives in Majuro, and is now chief of the Water Quality Division at the Republic of the Marshall Islands' Environmental Protection Agency.That severe drought of 1997–98 is just one of several he has lived through, and — as the country faces a warmer future — it's expected there will be more on the horizon.So he and others in the Marshall Islands are harnessing traditional knowledge and new research to better prepare for what the future holds.Despite water making up most of the Marshall Islands' total area — which comprises almost 2 million square kilometres of the Pacific Ocean — the nation continually grapples with fresh water shortages.Northern islands, which get less rainfall than their southern counterparts, tend to get hit by more frequent and severe droughts.But even the lush green islands down south, such as Majuro Atoll, regularly experience dry spells.In a typical year, Majuro receives more than 3,200 millimetres of rain. That's about twice Sydney's average annual rainfall.While that sounds like a lot of water, only a tiny fraction can be captured and stored for later use. The nation's entire land area covers just 180 sq km, with little in the way of water catchments.And if there's little rainfall during the dry season — January to March — fresh water supplies on Majuro run perilously low, too.This happened most recently in 2015–16, with a drought driven by one of the strongest El Niño events in recorded history.From January to April of 2016, Majuro received just 22 per cent of its average rainfall for that period. By May, more than 20,000 people across the Marshall Islands were affected by severe drought conditions.Risks extended past the need for drinking water. Without fresh water for bathing and washing, diseases spread faster.The country takes an economic hit with each drought, too. When there's little water around, coconut palms — an important economic crop — reduce the number of female flowers they make and produce smaller coconuts that drop before they mature. Seedlings and even some mature trees die.Food, water, soap and reverse-osmosis units were flown or shipped around the nation until the drought finally broke in May.Lee Jacklick, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Majuro, is part of a project that's collecting and documenting traditional weather forecasting knowledge from the outer islands.This knowledge has helped Marshallese people navigate the oceans and survive on little rainfall for thousands of years.""Throughout the ages, we in the Marshall Islands have been known to be very good weather people,"" Mr Jacklick says.""If there are cockroaches all of a sudden flying all over the house … [or] you see a mother spider gathering and protecting her babies, that is another sign of adverse weather approaching the islands.""Many buildings now have rainwater tanks. But in the days before, coconut trees could be used as ""living buckets"" of sorts to store rainfall.This involved gouging a bucket-sized hollow into the base of a tree, which collects rain dribbling down the trunk.""It can collect maybe a gallon or two of water, and that would be enough for one or two individuals,"" Mr Jacklick says.""This was the common practice back then.""Taking rainfall collection and storage to a much grander scale is the Majuro's airport runway and surrounding pavement areas.It's the biggest paved area on the atoll by far and the main water harvesting site.As rain falls on the concrete and runs off the side into the sand, a network of pipes ferries the water to a nearby reservoir.This is the main water supply for half the atoll, including the main city of Majuro.The other half of the atoll relies on a subterranean source.Keep driving past the airport, and you'll eventually reach the end of the road. This is a community called Laura, and here, the thin strip of land broadens like the clasp of a safety pin.The land here is a couple of kilometres wide, allowing farms to grow fruit and vegetables and to rear animals.It's also home to a huge reservoir of fresh groundwater.As rain falls on Laura, it trickles through sand and coral until it meets sea water.Being lighter than seawater, the fresh water floats, creating what's known as a ""lens"". Like the lens in your eye, the Laura groundwater lens is thicker in the centre and thinner towards the edges, which are closest to the coast.Fresh lens water is drawn from wells and pumped out to supply houses further away on the atoll. During drought, it can also reinforce the airport reservoir's supplies.Keeping tabs on this underwater reserve is Mr Ketedromo and his colleagues. This is made possible by 10 clusters of innocuous-looking pipes scattered across Laura.One end of the pipes sticks up out of the ground while the other plunges deep into the lens below, some all the way through the fresh water and into the seawater underneath.Mr Ketedromo's team regularly makes rounds of the monitoring sites, dropping probes down the pipes to measure the salinity and depth of the water below.""Because the groundwater system has to be recharged by rain, if it's the dry season, you expect it to be saltier, and if it's the wet season, you expect it to be fresh,"" Mr Ketedromo says.This data, which stretches back decades, is being used to model how the lens will change in a warming world.The Marshall Islands are already feeling the pressure brought by climate change.It's a low-lying nation, sitting an average of a metre or two above sea level. Battering waves erode the coastline, and some areas already flood regularly with high tides.This includes the airport, which can get swamped with seawater when high winds push lagoon water over the land.This inundation is why a low stone wall has been built alongside the airstrip, Mr Jacklick says.""We have to protect the airstrip, which is our lifeline towards getting the much-needed rainfall.""Laura is not immune to flooding, either. As ocean waves inundate the land there, salty water can trickle into the freshwater lens from above.As sea levels rise, climate scientists predict such ocean floods will happen more often. How rainfall changes is yet to be seen.Mr Jacklick is helping people living on outer islands to more accurately predict the weather in this era of climate change. ""Traditional knowledge is based on observing for a very long time,"" he says.""You get to a point where you know the averages. But when you put climate change into the equation, then there it goes — you get wrong forecasts.""Combining traditional and modern science means communities can now make more accurate forecasts, he adds.""When we introduced the scientific part of it, then there was a big change. Now we can respond more appropriately in time.""He's also helping to formulate the Marshall Islands' National Drought Contingency Plan, which he says will help the nation better monitor drought conditions and prepare to respond to limited water supplies.Mr Ketedromo, who now has kids of his own, is concerned about the Marshall Islands' water prospects and says it's crucial to start preparing now.""We already see impacts now, and I'm very worried that king tides, land erosion and dry periods and droughts are going to happen even more in the future.""I don't know how the population will change in the coming 30 years, but for people who rely on rainfall and groundwater for daily purposes, and who don't have water companies to supply them, it's a real worry.""","Climate Change, Droughts, Earth Sciences, El Niño, Marshall Islands, Rain, Science and Technology, Water, Water Management, Weather Forecasts, ",2023-10-23 19:00:00+00:00

The system needs to be better. People need certainty.""But the government maintains the ballot will ensure equitable access to Australia, and help to avoid a brain drain from the Pacific.Professor Stephen Howes from the Australian National University said the ballot system had functioned well for a similar visa scheme in New Zealand.""The New Zealand visa is popular and widely accepted, so it just makes eminent sense for Australia to follow the path New Zealand set,"" he told the ABC.Professor Howes said the timing of the legislation's passage would also work well for Labor ahead of a critical Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders meeting in Cook Islands in early November.""We're heading into the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting … and know the whole issue of visa-free access is going to be raised,"" he said.""It's not something Australia is prepared to concede, but Australia can point to this very significant initiative as a practical way in which it's making movement into Australia very much easier.""While some Pacific nations have privately raised some concerns that the Pacific Engagement Visa could exacerbate skills shortages in the region, some high-profile Pacific politicians have enthusiastically backed the proposal.Fiji's Deputy Prime Minister Biman Prasad told the ABC that the visa would promote business investment between Australia and the Pacific, as well as ""allowing ideas and innovation to move from one country to another.""""In a broader sense, this is part of a broader strategy to integrate the region in the long term,"" he said.""And given the geopolitics as well, uniting the region in this way will benefit the whole of the region.""He also dismissed anxieties about the visa feeding into a brain drain in the Pacific.""There's a thinking that everyone will suddenly pack their bags, but that won't happen,"" he told the ABC.""In fact, it may create an environment where people feel the opportunity is there and there will be more stability.""The government still wants to pass separate legislation through parliament which would give Pacific Engagement Visa holders access to additional welfare benefits.It is vowing to open the program in the first half of next year, which will allow the first visa holders to settle in Australia later in 2024.Pat Conroy said the federal government was still working out exactly how the 3,000 spots would be split between different Pacific countries.""We're working through what we disclose but I think there are strong reasons for the country allocations to be made public,"" he said.The minister said the places would be allocated ""broadly but not completely"" in line with the populations of various countries, and that Australia would make sure Pacific nations were ""comfortable"" with their allocations.He also said some of the 13 Pacific countries eligible for the scheme might not take part until the second year.""There are some countries which are very enthusiastic and want to be part of the early rollout, and there are others that have said they will take a step back and be part of the second year,"" he said.Professor Howes said it was a potentially transformative moment in Australia's relationship with the Pacific.""This is the first time we've had a Pacific window into not our temporary migration program, but our permanent migration program,"" he told the ABC.""It certainly puts the Pacific at a very elevated status.""","Australia, Farm Labour, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Immigration, Immigration Policy, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Nauru, New Zealand, Pacific, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trade, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Work, World Politics, ",2023-10-19 05:53:21+00:00

— the fictional home of SpongeBob SquarePants. But the underwater world of the quirky cartoon character is based on a real place in the Pacific Ocean — and one with a dark history.As anthropologist Holly Barker explains, the real-life Bikini Atoll in Marshall Islands was subjected to Cold War-era nuclear weapons testing by the United States.The site continues to captivate researchers today — from unearthing trace elements of uranium in the shells of sea turtles, to measuring the impact of nuclear fallout on the health of the ocean.Lying about halfway between Papua New Guinea and Hawaii, Bikini Atoll was where the US government detonated 23 nuclear weapons between 1946 and 1958, vaporising three islands and leaving behind radioactive contamination.One of the explosions, codenamed ""Castle Bravo"", was the equivalent of the detonation of 1,000 Hiroshima-sized bombs, Dr Barker wrote for The Conversation.Dozens more nuclear weapons were tested at the nearby Enewetak Atoll.The US government forcibly evacuated 167 people from Bikini Atoll prior to the tests, but many starved due to a lack of food on their new islands.In the early 1970s, almost 200 were returned to their homes, but Dr Barker said that by 1978, they were removed again ""because they were found to have ingested more radioactive cesium from the environment than any known human population"".The Marshall Islands' National Nuclear Commission has in the past baulked at representations in popular culture, including in 2019, when it slammed the Manhattan Project Beer Company for naming one of its brews ""Bikini Atoll"".""Bikini is not a beer, a bathing suit, or the home of SpongeBob SquarePants,"" Marshall Islands' National Nuclear Commission said at the time.""It is the ancestral homelands of the Bikinian people who cannot reside there today because of the lingering radiation from US nuclear weapons tests conducted on the islands during the Cold War.""Scientist Cyler Conrad is the lead researcher of a recently published study which discovered nuclear contamination in the shells of turtles, including in the Marshall Islands, suggesting they may have survived 20th-century nuclear testing.But it was a different animated character — not SpongeBob — that he referenced in the introduction of his research paper.""Bert"" was a black-and-white cartoon turtle featured in the 1952 US Civil Defense Administration film Duck and Cover, designed to educate American children about what to do in the event of a nuclear attack.If the threat of an explosion was nearby, Bert would retract inside his shell, taking cover, just as children were encouraged to find shelter under their school desks.""Our research highlights that Bert's fictional experience was in some ways true — turtles, tortoises, and sea turtles live in areas with historic nuclear activity and may have survived the immediate effects of nuclear events,"" Dr Conrad's paper read.""But our study also confirms that the record of this nuclear activity is present and measurable within these same animals long after first exposure.""In an interview with the ABC's Pacific Beat, Dr Conrad explained that sea turtles and tortoises grew colourful material on top of their shells called ""scute keratin"" — a similar material to human fingernails.""They grow that tissue on their shells sequentially over time, very similar to trees and tree rings,"" he said.His team found turtles in national history museum collections that had been collected from areas with past nuclear activity, including in Marshall Islands.""We were really quite shocked and surprised by the results,"" he said.They found very small amounts of radioactive isotopes recorded in the layers of the shells like ""time stamps"".""We found turtles that clearly lived through active contamination in the environment … that would have been accumulating this contamination in real time during their life,"" he said.But in shell fragments from a green sea turtle from the Enewetak Atoll — which had been devoured by a tiger shark — they found contamination that appeared at least 20 years after above-ground testing had ended.""We did not anticipate that there would be these signatures in the turtles so many decades after testing,"" he said.Despite this, he said there was no evidence of any health impact on the turtles and tortoises at the time.Kristin Berry, a wildlife biologist with expertise in desert tortoises at the Western Ecological Research Centre who was not involved in Mr Conrad's study, told Wired magazine the best time to assess the impact of contamination would have been while the animals were alive, and suggested further controlled experiments in captivity could help discover if they absorbed contamination through their food, the air, or other means. Dr Conrad said the findings offered some ideas about potential contamination into the sea turtle through its diet or environment, but also spoke to the sensitivity of today's instruments to be able to detect even minuscule or trace amounts of uranium isotopes.Other researchers not involved in the study have pointed out turtles are sensitive to environmental changes and can provide insight into emerging problems, and suggested the non-invasive methods could be used on living turtles as well.Dr Conrad said we have a much better understanding of the legacy of nuclear testing today, adding that scientists had also studied other animals — such as boars in Europe following the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster.He hopes to study molluscs in further detail to map past human activity on the animal world — not just the impacts of nuclear testing, but also climate change.The atolls in Marshall Islands have also been a source of fascination for Enric Sala, a conservationist and founder of National Geographic Pristine Seas.""I was a professor at the University of California and decided to quit academia because I felt that all I was doing was writing the obituary of the ocean,"" he told the ABC's Pacific Beat.""Our work matters because today only 3 per cent of the ocean is fully protected from people, fully protected from fishing and other damaging activities.""The countries of the world agreed last December to protect 30 per cent of the global ocean by 2030, so we have a lot of work to do.""He recently led a team visiting four remote atolls in Marshall Islands, including Bikini Atoll.The aim of the expedition was to assess the health of the marine environment to see how Bikini Atoll has recovered from nuclear testing, and to compare it with nearby Rongerik Atoll, which was not bombed and provides an ""undisturbed"" reference point.""These reefs are as wild and pristine as it gets,"" he said, referring to two other Marshall Islands atolls.""We jumped in the water outside the reef, and there was a wall of sharks below us.""The Marshall Islands still has places that are rare examples of what coral reefs used to be like.""His crew was also working with local researchers who were able to use the Pristine Seas technology — submersibles that can descend to 400 metres and cameras that can explore 6,000 metres below sea level.""You should have seen the faces coming out of the water after having seen all these deep species … they were very happy to discover a new part of the country,"" Dr Sala said.Marshall Islands has a blueprint for conservation called Reimaanlok, which is Marshallese for ""looking to the future, together"".Dr Sala described this as a ""pioneering"" grassroots approach from communities to identify which areas should be protected and how to manage maritime resources so they were sustainable for future generations.He said he hoped his surveys could help inform the process by gathering information about some of the hard-to-reach remote atolls.""The ocean has absorbed 90 per cent of the extra heat that we have generated since the Industrial Revolution through burning of fossil fuels,"" he said.""We have used the ocean as our sewer — we have thrown everything that we don't want [into it], and we take out everything that we like.""The oceans give us food, oxygen, they regulate the climate — they give us so many things that are essential to our survival.""So it's about time that we give the ocean more respect.""","Academic Research, Animal Science, Biology, Environment, History,

Spills and leaks pollute waters and coastlines.Toxic emissions from burning fuel can contribute to conditions such as asthma and cardiovascular disease in people living near ports.But the Marshall Islands has a plan. It involves marrying traditional engineering with futuristic technology to wean its fleets off diesel altogether.The climate-vulnerable nation has also spent decades urging the rest of the world to kick their addiction to fossil fuels.Especially the global shipping industry, which spews a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year.Because without rapid decarbonisation, the very ocean that provides so much to the Marshall Islands might one day render much of their limited land uninhabitable.Atina is one of the latest in a long line of Marshallese people to bring their plight to the world stage.Last year, she addressed a symposium on low- and zero-carbon shipping fuels, run by the International Maritime Organization.""The economics are clear,"" she said. ""Kicking the can costs more than acting decisively now.""And Atina knows. She's a researcher with the Micronesian Center for Sustainable Transport, which is based in the Marshall Islands' capital, Majuro.The Center provides policy analysis and research on transportation issues in the country and wider region, with a heavy focus on maritime transport.""So much of our work, in addition to calling all countries to decarbonise rapidly, [is to] provide resourcing for climate-vulnerable regions to be able to deal with the impacts, while the whole world continues on its glacial pace of decarbonisation,"" Atina says as we sit in her office.When it comes to cleaning up the global shipping industry, the Marshall Islands is starting at home.The Center recently published a framework that aims to fully decarbonise transport in the Marshall Islands by 2050.The framework is called Rebbelib 2050, named after the stick maps Marshallese navigators used for centuries as they traversed the long stretches of Pacific.Some of the potential technologies in the framework include wingships: vessels that are part-boat, part-plane that fly a few metres above the sea surface on a cushion of air. They're much faster and more fuel-efficient than a standard boat of the same size.The nation has partnered with South Korea on this project, along with another that aims to make sustainable fuel locally.The process, called ocean thermal energy conversion or OTEC, uses the temperature difference between warm water and cold water to generate electricity.Surplus energy could then go into creating hydrogen-based electrofuels, which could be used to power boats.Coral atolls near the equator, like those in the Marshall Islands, are ideal places to build OTEC facilities.That's because atolls tend to drop off like a cliff into the frigid depths, where the water's only around 4 degrees Celsius. Their surface waters hover around the high 20s.It's something the Marshall Islands hopes to trial with a pilot project later this year, Atina says.For the past few years, a venture into sustainable sea transport has operated from a tall A-frame building overlooking the lagoon.Waan Aelõñ in Majel (WAM), or Canoes of the Marshall Islands, was originally founded to teach life skills, woodworking and sailing to young Marshallese men and women.A few years ago, the NGO branched out to teach traditional Marshallese boat-building to people from the less-populated outer islands.Four boat-builders from four islands travel to Majuro at a time, where they're given a place to stay and a wage.Over three months, the group builds four double-hulled sailing boats at WAM.The boat designs merge contemporary engineering with old-school Marshallese elements, and are made from easily accessible and modern materials, like marine plywood, rather than the traditional breadfruit wood.The builders learn how to sail and maintain the boats, and are dropped off on their home island with their newly made vessels.There are a plethora of reasons for outer island communities to harness the power of the wind, WAM associate director Tony Alik says — for instance, the price of oil, which is particularly expensive in regional areas.He hopes that communities will start using wind-powered canoes as their default mode of sea transport.""I'm not against motor boats, I use them from time to time, but when you have the option to use alternative energy, it just makes sense to use it,"" Tony says.""Especially living in the Marshall Islands where the skill is already there. The knowledge has been safeguarded for you.""Outside the WAM building is a catamaran with an addition: solar panels.""Navigators in the past, they knew when to sail and when to stay home,"" Tony says.""But unforeseen circumstances happen and unfortunately, sometimes the wind dies, and you're stuck.""This is where the addition of solar helps. Should a catamaran find itself on the open water with no wind, the solar motor kicks in.This catamaran's motor is missing; after only a couple of months' use, it was lost in a fire that destroyed WAM's adjoining classroom and museum.But WAM is buying more solar motors, Tony says.""Then we're piloting those ones, so if they're really sustainable, easy to use and maintain, then the goal is to outfit all the canoes that we're sending to the outer islands with the option to have a solar motor.""Exactly how full decarbonisation in the Marshall Islands will look, and how much traditional boat-building skills or new technologies such as hydrogen-based electro-fuels will feed into it, is still, for the most part, unknown.But even though carbon emissions produced by diesel-powered Marshallese boats is barely a blip in the global total, Atina Schutz says transitioning into emission-free and fully sustainable sea transport ""is not just important for our society, but it's also our way of walking our talk"".Her message to the world's shipping industry is clear.""The [global] shipping industry hasn't done much to mitigate its impacts on the climate system, so we need you to really step up and work with us in decarbonising the world fleet.""","Air Pollution, Chemistry, Climate Change, Decarbonisation, Energy, Engineering, Environmental Impact, Global Warming, Hydrogen Fuel, Marshall Islands, Oceans and Reefs, Pollution, Science and Technology, Water Pollution, ",2023-09-04 20:00:00+00:00

the current compact with Palau expires in 2024, but administration officials say they believe all three can be renewed and signed by mid-to-late spring.Officials would not discuss specifics of the amounts of money involved because the deals are not yet legally binding, and must still be reviewed and approved by Congress.A Micronesian news outlet, Marianas Variety, reported on Thursday that the Marshall Islands will receive $US700 million ($1 billion) over four years under the memorandum that it signed.But that amount would cover only one-fifth of a 20-year compact extension, and does not include the amount Palau would receive.Joe Yun, President Biden's special envoy for compact negotiations, said the amounts will be far greater than what the US had provided in the past.Islanders have long complained that the previous compacts they signed did not adequately address their needs or long-term environmental and health issues caused by US nuclear testing in the 1950s and '60s.Politicians had expressed concern dating back to 2021 that the administration was not giving enough attention to the matter.Mr Yun, who signed the memorandums with representatives of the Marshalls and Palau on Tuesday and Wednesday in Los Angeles, said the Marshall Islands, in particular, would be compensated for such damage and would be given control over how that money is spent.Mr Yun said it would pay ""nuclear-affected communities' health, welfare and development"" and also noted that the US had committed to building a new hospital as well as a museum in the Marshalls to preserve the memory and legacy of their role, notably in the Pacific theatre during World War II. This week's signings also clear the way for individual federal agencies — including the Postal Service, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Weather Service — to negotiate their own agreements with the Marshalls and Palau, which will then become part of the broader compacts.Along with the federal money, those agencies provide their services to the islands.In return, the US is given unique military and national security basing rights and privileges in an area where China is increasingly flexing its muscles.Mr Yun said China did not come up specifically in the negotiations, but it was a major element in all sides' discussions.""The threat from China is unstated but there is no question that China is a factor,"" Mr Yun said.Not only does China have a large and growing economic presence in the region, but the Marshall Islands and Palau both recognise Taiwan diplomatically.""They are coming under Chinese pressure,"" he said.China has steadily poached allies from Taiwan in the Pacific, including Kiribati and the Solomon Islands in 2019.The US announced plans last year to reopen an embassy in the Solomon Islands, which has signed a security agreement with China.Since World War II, the US has treated the Marshall Islands, along with Micronesia and Palau, much like territories.On the Marshall Islands, the US has developed military, intelligence and aerospace facilities in a region where China is particularly active.In turn, US money and jobs have benefited the islands' economy.And many islanders have taken advantage of their ability to live and work in the US, moving in the thousands to Arkansas, Guam, Hawaii, Oregon and Oklahoma.Many on the Marshall Islands believe a US settlement of $US150 million ($215 million) agreed in the 1980s fell well short of addressing the nuclear legacy.But the US position has remained static for more than 20 years, the last time the compact came up for renegotiation.Various estimates put the true cost of the damage at about $US3 billion ($4.3 billion), including for repairs to a massive nuclear waste facility known as the Cactus Dome which environmentalists say is leaking toxic waste into the ocean.The US Department of Energy says the dome contains over 76,000 cubic meters of radioactive soil and debris, but the structure isn't in any immediate danger of failing.AP","Defence and National Security, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Federated States Of, National Security, Pacific, Palau, Treaties and Alliances, United States, World Politics, ",2023-01-14 07:06:15+00:00

But we managed,"" she said.Living in PNG's highlands, Ms Kanamon said she often felt judged by her inability to breastfeed.""People would give me that look of disappointment when I was feeding my child with a bottle instead of breastmilk,"" she said.""Not a lot of us understand the different, various reasons why working mums can't breastfeed.""PNG news director Genesis Ketan wanted to exclusively breastfeed her four children, including twins, but managing work and nursing proved difficult.Ms Ketan gave birth to her daughter in 2017 but it coincided with the country's elections, so she returned to work three weeks later.Missing out on crucial bonding time with her baby had lasting impacts.""I had to exclusively bottle-feed after that and I've noticed she has formed a closer relationship to her babysitter and her father than to me,"" she said.""You want that bond that comes from breastfeeding your baby.""PNG is one of the last countries in the world to guarantee paid maternity leave.Working mothers are entitled to six weeks of maternity leave, unpaid — for it to be paid, they must convert sick leave and recreation leave into maternity leave. While Ms Ketan felt supported by her employer, who granted her leave to breastfeed her premature twin babies, she said she still faced barriers. ""It's easier if you have a vehicle so you can travel home to breastfeed during the lunchtime, or express pump milk and fill up the bottles,"" she said.""But I didn't have a car at the time, so I couldn't go home and come back to work.""Employers need to make paid time for this, or even if it is on our lunchbreak, then our employer needs to provide transport to and from our home.""If everything at home is fine and our babies are fully fed, satisfied and happy, then we're happy workers and we're able to be more productive at the end of the day.""Physician and mother Mangu Kendino's breastfeeding experience with her seven-month-old daughter has been different to Ms Kanamon and Ms Ketan's. Under PNG's Public Services Act, female public servants are entitled to two hours of paid breastfeeding leave per day for six months. But utilising it becomes a matter of being able to ""potentially accommodate for that during the work schedule,"" Dr Kanamon said.""I wake up in the morning, she wakes up after me, I breastfeed her, then I run off to work,"" she said.""It's then a cycle throughout the day when I'm returning at 10am, 12pm, 2pm.""Dr Kendino said she is ""in awe"" of those who still accommodate for feeds, without financial support from their employer.""If you are not exclusively breastfeeding within the six-month period, don't feel you are inferior in any way,"" she said.Frances Vulivuli, a health and nutrition specialist with UNICEF in Fiji, said the ""worrisome"" decline in breastfeeding rates were being seen in Samoa and countries not signed up to the World Health Assembly code to promote breastfeeding.Of the 14 Pacific Island countries supported by UNICEF Pacific, only two have taken regulatory action in line with the code — Fiji and Palau.""In Samoa, the exclusive breastfeeding dropped from 70.3 per cent in 2014 to 51.7 per cent in 2019,"" she said.""Early initiation within the first hour fell from 81.4 per cent in 2014 to 53 per cent in 2019.Dr Vulivuli said ""urgent action"" must be taken to address this decline across the Pacific.""Babies who are exclusively breastfed are 14 times less likely to die in the first six months than babies who are not breastfed,"" she said.""Breastmilk saves children's lives as it provides antibodies that give babies a healthy boost and protect them against many childhood illnesses.""","Breastfeeding, Children, Fiji, Health, Healthcare Facilities, Infant Health, Marshall Islands, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Parenting, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Work, ",2022-02-26 17:58:56+00:00

The forum did not honour their commitments,"" he said. Mr Panuelo said resolving the leadership issue would allow Pacific Island nations to move on from the PIF leadership dispute and focus on more important issues, like COVID-19 and climate change. Mr Panuelo also said he was confident other Pacific Island nations and the PIF leadership would deliver what they had promised. ""We would not have been confident or decide unanimously to have this temporary pause [of our withdrawal] if we don't have confidence,"" he said. ""It's good to have the good faith and trust that these things will materialise in [the] time we've indicated [by June],"" he said.The deal has not yet been confirmed by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, or by Fiji's government.The ABC has approached both for comment. But if the agreement stops the Pacific Islands Forum from splitting, it will be a source of relief in capitals across the region. Australian officials worried that the breakdown of the forum would be politically destabilising, while Pacific leaders said splitting PIF would undermine Pacific efforts to campaign collectively on critical issues like climate change.Mr Panuelo said several major countries in the wider region — including the United States, China, Japan, Australia and New Zealand — had pressed Pacific leaders to keep the forum united. He also indicated that several political heavyweights, including Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape and Nauru's President Lionel Rouwen Aingimea, had been heavily involved in negotiations to find a solution to the dispute. And while Mr Panuelo is still keen for Mr Zackios to take the position, he said that Micronesia had been asked to put forward two candidates for the role. Tess Newton Cain, who is the Project Lead of the Griffith Asia Institute's Pacific Hub, said it was ""possibly a bit surprising"" to see Mr Panuelo lay out the deal in so much detail before it had been formally announced. ""What we should hope is that it's a sign that everyone is confident that yes, this can go ahead,"" she told ABC News. Ms Newton Cain said the deal reflected how heavily the forum prioritised unityBut she said that PIF was now entering ""uncharted waters"" and some other countries may worry about the precedent set by the deal. ""Once this has happened, there's always a sense of what happens next time? If Melanesia wants their candidate, would they go down this route as well?"" she said. ""Having said that, as we know, the whole process of appointment of the secretary-general is under wholesale review.""So what's happened now will feed into this … in terms of developing a new process for appointing the SG, which means we hopefully don't have to go through this again."" ","Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Nauru, Pacific, Palau, Papua New Guinea, World Politics, ",2022-02-14 06:15:30+00:00

18,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-22/common-reporting-standard-tax-office-bouvet-island-bank-accounts/100556452,"Bouvet Island is a bleak and desolate place, and considered the world's most remote.Located towards the bottom of the South Atlantic Ocean, it's generally windswept, frequently fog-shrouded, and mostly covered by a glacier.A dependency of Norway and declared a nature reserve in the 1970s, no-one lives there, and it's visited only infrequently by Norwegian polar expeditions.The nearest human habitation is Gough Island, 1,600 kilometres to the north, and even that's just a weather station and scientific outpost crewed by roughly half a dozen South Africans.Otherwise, Queen Maud Land of Antarctica lies 1,700 kilometres to the south, the South Sandwich Islands 1,900 kilometres to the west and South Africa 2,600 kilometres to the north-east.Bouvet's only vertebrate residents are thousands of seals, seabirds and penguins.So you can imagine Mark Zirnsak's surprise when he was looking through some data released by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and found that almost $2.5 million in Australian bank accounts belonged to foreign tax residents apparently from Bouvet Island.While the number of accounts fell from 15 in 2018 to 12 in the latest 2019 data, the amount of cash in them rose from a mere $9,220 to $2,454,996.""The ATO data raises serious red flags, such as account holders from an uninhabited island holding millions of dollars in Australia,"" the Tax Justice Network Australia spokesperson told the ABC.But Bouvet is not the only uninhabited sub-Antarctic island where people, companies or trusts that hold Australian bank accounts are apparently resident.Heard Island and the McDonald Islands, a territory of Australia governed under the laws of the ACT, had 48 accounts registered to ""residents"" collectively containing almost a million dollars.Australians do visit the islands, mainly scientists with a smattering of Antarctic tourists, but there isn't a permanent base and you need pre-approval from the Australian Antarctic Division to legally set foot there.Not to be outdone, 20 accounts with a total balance of $348,759 listed ""Antartica"" (sic) as the place of residency. Aside from the typo, Antarctica is not a sovereign entity and should have no residents for tax purposes.The ATO said there were a couple of reasons why an account holder's place of tax residency might not be where they lived or their company operated.""An account reported as belonging to Antarctica means the account is held by a financial institution in Australia, but the account holder has indicated they are a tax resident in Antarctica,"" a spokesperson explained.""Tax residency is not always the same as 'residency' or 'citizenship'. Account holders are required to self-assess their tax residency status when opening new accounts.""The tax office said it compared data with overseas authorities and used data analytics to pick up anomalies, such as people listed as tax residents in uninhabited jurisdictions.The ATO said in 2019 only 0.0058 per cent of reportable account holders were listed as tax residents in uninhabited jurisdictions. ""Our compliance activities have confirmed jurisdictions such as Antarctica are sometimes reported by mistake,"" the ATO said.""For example, a customer or frontline employee from a financial institution might select Antarctica instead of Australia from a drop-down box when opening an account.""These mistakes are required to be verified and corrected by the financial institution.""But, while accounts held by people or companies registered as being at the remotest ends of the world may grab the headlines, the amounts involved with these locations are relatively small.Overall, the 2019 data released under the fairly new common reporting standard (CRS) scheme revealed there were 7.1 million accounts held by foreign tax residents in Australia holding a total of $241 billion.Worldwide, the OECD said the 2019 CRS reports covered 84 million accounts holding 10 trillion euros ($15.6 trillion) in assets.The real concern in the ATO data, according to Mr Zirnsak, is the prevalence of tax havens at the top of the list for large account balances.When he sorted the list by average account balance, the top 10 were all so-called secrecy jurisdictions — the kind exposed in the recent Pandora Papers, where trusts and/or shell companies can be established, taxes are low or non-existent and local laws work to protect the identity of the people who really own the assets.Number one on the 2019 list was the Marshall Islands, with an average account balance of $2.9 million and 164 accounts, adding up to a total of nearly half a billion dollars in Australian financial institutions.These islands and coral atolls are about as far removed from Bouvet as you can get.Located near the equator in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the Marshall Islands are inhabited.But with a population of about 60,000 and a GDP per capita of just over $US4,000 (a bit over $5,300) it seems unlikely that most of the money in the Australian accounts comes from people who actually live there.Although the Marshall Islands have now been removed from OECD and EU tax haven blacklists, and they actually rank one place better than Australia on the Tax Justice Network's global financial secrecy index, they're the second-largest shipping registry after Panama providing a ""flag of convenience"" for ship owners (i.e. cheap registration and relaxed regulation).Tax rates in the Marshall Islands are also low, between 8 per cent and 12 per cent on wages or salaries and 3 per cent on gross business revenues (as opposed to Australia's company tax, which is applied to net profits).The remainder of the top 10 were Tuvalu, the British Virgin Islands, Jersey, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Antigua and Barbuda, Guernsey, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Gibraltar.""The places where account holders are from that have the largest average account balances are all notorious tax havens,"" Mr Zirnsak said.""There are serious risks that some of the money is being laundered through Australia.""There are also risks that some Australians may be using front people in tax havens to conceal their ownership of some of these funds.""However, the ATO said it now had information-sharing arrangements with a majority of those tax havens.""The ATO currently exchanges data (sends and receives) with six of the 10 jurisdictions identified in your list of top 10 balances including Jersey, Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Antigua and Barbuda, Guernsey and Gibraltar,"" a tax office spokesperson said.The tax office said greater data sharing and more powerful analytics in recent years had assisted its efforts to minimise tax avoidance.""The Tax Avoidance Taskforce has proven very successful, contributing to the ATO raising tax liabilities of $22.9 billion and collecting $15.9 billion in cash, from July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2021,"" the spokesperson said.""The information collected by the CRS is valuable in informing the Tax Avoidance Taskforce's work in identifying, investigating and disrupting offshore tax evasion and undeclared income in foreign bank accounts by Australian residents.""However, the spokesperson added that the ATO still welcomed tip-offs.""Tip-offs from concerned community members build on the intelligence we gather from our partners and helps us bring those who attempt to use offshore tax arrangements to account,"" they said. ""We encourage the community to report suspicious behaviour to us at ato.gov.au/tipoff.""The ABC also questioned Australia's anti-money laundering regulator, AUSTRAC, over the dubious locations disclosed in some of the CRS reporting.""Reporting entities are obliged to identify a customer (know your customer), checking that they are who they say they are, reporting suspicious matters and conducting additional verification checks when appropriate,"" a spokesperson responded.""This includes enhanced customer due diligence — a key obligation for all entities regulated under the AML/CTF [anti-money laundering/counter-terrorism financing] Act.""How account holders who were apparently tax residents in uninhabited jurisdictions complied with this requirement for ""due diligence"" and ""additional verification"" by financial institutions wasn't explained.""We also need reform to our anti-money laundering laws so that businesses and professionals that set up companies and trusts are required to report suspicious matters to AUSTRAC,"" Mr Zirnsak argued.""They should also be required to not do business with people they suspect are likely to be involved in criminal activity.""Australian anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws currently place obligations on banks and certain other financial operators to declare large or suspicious transactions, but those reporting obligations do not apply to many others, such as accountants, lawyers and real estate agents.Changes to impose reporting obligations on those sectors have been flagged by successive federal governments for years, but remain unlegislated.The first country on the list of largest average account balances that isn't a tax haven is the United States, although some US states are widely considered corporate tax havens, notably Delaware.Looking at the total, rather than average, account balances delivered a list of countries that more closely aligned with where Australia has significant business and migration relationships.US resident companies and individuals were number one on that list, with about $88 billion held across more than 621,000 accounts.China came next, with $28 billion across more than a million accounts, plus another $12.5 billion across 288,185 accounts held by Hongkongers, reflecting the large number of Chinese citizens and residents temporarily residing in Australia and businesses with interests here. They were followed by the UK ($21.5 billion across almost 664,000 accounts), Singapore ($14.4 billion across nearly 225,000 accounts) and New Zealand ($13.9 billion across more than 518,000 accounts).But, to give a further example of how disproportionately tax havens featured on the list, Cayman Islands residents ($2.5 billion) held a similar amount of cash in Australian accounts in 2019 as Canadians ($2.56 billion).Mr Zirnsak said the disproportionate prevalence of tax havens in the data highlighted the case to legislate for a register detailing who really owned the money parked in Australian bank accounts, so ownership wasn't hidden behind shell companies and trusts.""We need a public register of the beneficial ownership of companies and trusts so financial institutions can know who they are really dealing with and fulfil their obligations to prevent money laundering,"" he argued.""That needs to include laws that require nominee directors and owners of companies to disclose who they are acting on behalf of.""The data detailing foreign accounts with Australian financial institutions has only been produced since 2018, as part of international common reporting standards reforms pushed by the OECD and adopted here through legislation passed in 2016.Those reforms aim to reduce tax minimisation and financial crime through the sharing of financial data between countries.Some of the tax havens cited by the Tax Justice Network have signed up to the CRS system, including the Marshall Islands, as well as those sharing data with the ATO listed above.","Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Banking, Bermuda, Bouvet Island, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Heard Island and

19,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-02/pacific-blockchain-experiment-cryptocurrency-bitcoin/100495166,"It was beneath the thatched roof of a traditional meeting house in Pango village, Vanuatu, where many residents first learned about blockchain — the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. A team from Melbourne start-up Sempo, along with members of NGO Oxfam, were training villagers and vendors how to use Unblocked Cash, a pilot project funded in part by the Australian government.The system promised to ""revolutionise humanitarian aid"" by using a cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar — also called a stablecoin — to send money from donors directly to tap-and-pay cards given to participants.Not everyone who attended the training understood how blockchain or cryptocurrency worked, but many were keen to sign up to receive 10,000 Vatu ($122) in digital cash.The money was loaded onto tap-and-pay cards each month, which individuals could use in participating stores. Oxfam isn't alone in testing blockchain projects in the Pacific — a region which has some of the poorest internet connectivity in the world.Over the past five years, international NGOs, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Pacific governments and local programmers have developed world-first blockchain projects in the region.But critics fear the Pacific region is being used as a testing ground for experimental technology.Oxfam's blockchain project would go on to register 35,000 people in the Pacific region and has given more than $US2 million ($2.7 million) to participants.The transactions were tracked using a blockchain platform called Ethereum, allowing Oxfam to know exactly when, where and how the money is spent.""When they started, they selected single mothers, widows and widowers, and people with a disability,"" said a local store owner who attended the session in 2019.""Each person was entitled to one card, which had money inside it, and whatever they wanted inside my store they could then pay for it with their card.""Evelyn James, a participant from Port Vila, said receiving the money after signing up was a great benefit.""Just knowing that you have money, where you can go and buy something, it makes us really happy,"" she said.The team behind the project say it is revolutionary because, thanks to blockchain, cardholders don't need a bank account to receive donations.""There is a lot of lack of access in the Pacific right now, there's a high unbanked population ... So there's a lot of need for products like these,"" said Tristan Cole, the co-founder of Sempo who helped design the program.Jesse Gartner, Oxfam's cash transfer coordinator in Vanuatu, said the program pointed to the vast potential of blockchain technology in the Pacific.""Vanuatu is on the cutting edge of using this technology and it has allowed areas with very limited technological capacity to participate in a digital economy,"" he said.Put simply, blockchain is a digital public record where data is stored as ""blocks"" that are added to ""chains"" of information. The revolutionary aspect of blockchain is that there is no need for a middleman or institution to hold the information — instead, the entire blockchain is stored on thousands of computers around the world.If anyone wants to add a new block of data, all those computers need to verify the block and add it to the chain.The technology is commonly used for cryptocurrencies, where digital transactions are verified, recorded and added to the public record without the need for a central bank.The technology has spawned countless products in the Pacific – Oxfam uses blockchain to track donations on its Unblocked Cash program in real time, while Fiji and Asian Development Bank have developed a smart contract system to monitor the sale of indigenous land.A Fijian company uses blockchain technology to monitor fisheries around the Pacific. Tuvalu is developing a ""national digital ledger"" using blockchain, so that government services can be accessed on a transparent online system.The government also hopes to develop a blockchain digital payment system so its citizens can conveniently shop online.Tenanoia Simona, who heads the digital ledger project from Tuvalu's Ministry of Justice, Communications and Foreign Affairs, said their intention was to ""leapfrog Tuvalu into the digital space"".""The idea of using blockchain technology is to ensure resilience, transparency, integrity of government services,"" she said.Jessica Marinaccio from the  Ministry of Justice, who is also involved in the project, said it was quicker and cheaper to test blockchain technology in smaller Pacific nations than larger countries like Australia.""It kind of allows Tuvalu and places like the Marshall Islands, which have small populations, to really push themselves farther ahead in terms of technology.""Tuvalu hopes to soon offer a tender for a company to help develop the blockchain system for its government. But for critics, the desire to test the technology in Pacific Islands is a cause for concern.Olivier Jutel, from the University of Otago in New Zealand, has been studying the rise of cryptocurrency in the Pacific.He said blockchain projects were often a form of ""backdoor privatisation"", and an opportunity for foreign companies to test their products on Pacific populations.""They become very myopic, and don't think about the complexity of Pacific and developing world societies.""Many Pacific countries have laws against cryptocurrency, which can hinder the aspirations of blockchain innovators. For instance, Vanuatu prohibits trading cryptocurrencies, which has meant Oxfam's Unblocked Cash system relies on traditional cash stored in a private bank account.Though participants pay for their groceries using digital tokens given to them by Oxfam, the shops are reimbursed by Oxfam using a regular bank transfer.As a result, store owners do need a bank account to be part of Unblocked Cash, which has meant some local businesses in Vanuatu's villages can't take part.A shop owner in Pango village, who did not want to be named out of fear of being singled out by the community, said they weren't able to run their small store while waiting for Oxfam's reimbursements.They were also upset that larger businesses in the city were invited to take part and decided to leave the program after a couple of months.""They included all wholesale stores and hardware stores in town as well. So I found that I didn't have many customers,"" the store owner said.""If you're thinking about helping a local shop owner in the village, why would you open this out in town?""Freda Willy, another participant of the project, said she was grateful for the money but wished cheaper, local stores would also accept her card.""There's only one [participating] vendor at the market. You have to go when she's there or you can't buy the food,"" she said.Oxfam has said only 9 per cent of the 352 vendors in the project were large supermarkets, and 54 per cent were community stores or fresh food sellers.Mr Gartner from Oxfam said the feedback from both vendors and cardholders had been overwhelmingly positive, but his team was working to better support local businesses.While some countries face regulatory hurdles, others have tried to implement laws to develop cryptocurrency within the Pacific.Israeli entrepreneur Barak Ben-Ezer has developed a cryptocurrency for the Marshall Islands called the Sovereign, or SOV.In 2018, the country passed a law to make the cryptocurrency its national legal tender.The project has since stalled, but Mr Ben-Ezer remains optimistic.""There's a big opportunity here,"" he said.In Tonga, MP Lord Fusitu'a is drafting a bill to make Bitcoin a legal tender in the Pacific nation, like what was done in El Salvador last month.He believed ""developing and emerging markets"" like those in the Pacific stand to benefit the most from cryptocurrency, since they relied so heavily on international banks and the associated fees.In Tonga for example, 40 per cent of its national GDP comes from people abroad sending money back to family, and Lord Fusitu'a said by using cryptocurrency like Bitcoin instead of traditional banks, those remittances could be cheaper and faster. But despite his support for Bitcoin, Lord Fusitu'a said he was concerned some people in the Pacific might be tempted to support unlisted alt-coins or speculative blockchain projects.""If you put your life savings into something that's not on that [regulated] list, that's gone,"" he said.Concerns around cryptocurrency aside, many believe the underlying blockchain technology holds the key to accelerating development in the region.""I don't see this as being experimental, I see this as being pioneering,"" Mr Gartner from Oxfam said.""Blockchain is here.

It's a solid (but cautious) summary of the current best available science,"" Ms Thunberg wrote on Twitter, referring to the report.""It doesn't tell us what to do. It is up to us to be brave and take decisions based on the scientific evidence provided in these reports.""However, she added, there were ""no real surprises"" in the report, saying it confirmed ""what we already know"".""According to the new IPCC report, the carbon budget that gives us the best odds of staying below [1.5C] runs out in less than 5 and a half years at our current emissions rate,"" she wrote.""Maybe someone should ask the people in power how they plan to 'solve' that?""The report said global warming had now reached 1.1C since industrialisation (1850-1900).The report warned warming by more than 1.5C could result in frequent and more severe fires, droughts, floods and cyclones.United Nations (UN) secretary-general Antonio Guterres labelled it a ""code red for humanity"".Joëlle Gergis, a climatologist from the Australian National University and a lead author of the IPCC's report chapter on changes in rainfall, said the most important thing people could do was vote.""Get behind political leaders at every level of government who have a clear vision to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, restore landscapes and our coastlines, to create a more equitable world,"" she told the ABC.Meanwhile, Pacific Island leaders and activists have issued yet another plea for major emitters to urgently curb emissions and take ambitious steps to fight climate change at the November COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow.The Pacific has already suffered from more severe cyclones, king tides and increasing drought because of climate change.Experts warn the IPCC report makes it clear those problems will get much worse if emissions are not rapidly cut, while low-lying Pacific nations may be swamped by rising seas within decades.Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama — who is also the incoming chair of the Pacific Islands Forum — said on Twitter the new IPCC report ""puts Pacific Island nations 0.4 degrees Celsius away from existential catastrophe"".""We know what's coming. More importantly, we know how to stop it,"" he wrote.""We need: dramatic cuts in emissions by 2030. Net-zero emissions by 2050. No excuses.""Fiji's ambassador and permanent representative to the UN, Satyendra Prasad, said the world only had 84 days until the COP26 meeting, and it was crucial to keep the world from heating beyond 1.5C.""The new [IPCC] report confirms [a] more catastrophic future for small Pacific states than predicted earlier,"" he wrote. ""There is no excuse for not delivering on [the] 1.5 degree target.""The secretary-general of the Pacific Islands Forum, Henry Puna, said ""we have lost the luxury of time"".""We are on the brink of a climate catastrophe, with a narrow window to act,"" he said in response to the report.""Governments, big business, the major emitters of the world can no longer ignore the voices of those already enduring this unfolding existential crisis. They can no longer choose rhetoric over action.""There are simply no more excuses to be had. Our actions today will have consequences now and into the future for all of us to bear.""The major concern for the Pacific, he said, was the forecast rise in sea levels — 2 metres by 2100 and a ""disastrous"" potential 5 metre rise by 2150.""The report also found that extreme sea level events that previously occurred once in 100 years could happen every year by the end of this century,"" he said.""To put this into perspective, this will result in the loss of millions of lives, homes and livelihoods across the Pacific and the world.""The upcoming COP26 conference has to lead to major emissions reductions, he said.""We have only one planet and one final opportunity to ensure its survival,"" he said.""We must leave a future for our children to inherit.""Kathy Jetn̄il-Kijiner, the climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, also warned that Pacific Island nations desperately needed the 1.5C goal to stay within reach.""The latest IPCC climate report shows that this goal is now quickly slipping beyond our grasp. COP26 must be the moment where countries ensure this goal remains within reach,"" she said.The report found that on the current trajectory, the world is likely to hit warming of 1.5C by 2030.Even in the most ambitious scenario, it would likely hit 1.5C by about 2035, it said.In all scenarios, getting the world back under that extra 1.5C would require massive reforestation, or technology, to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which has yet been proven to work at scale.","Climate Change, Environmental Impact, Environmental Management, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Marshall Islands, Pacific, Samoa, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, ",2021-08-10 06:30:07+00:00

22,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-10/what-does-the-pacific-islands-forum-split-mean-for-australia/13137346,"Early on Tuesday morning, the Pacific Islands Forum split.Five Micronesian leaders declared they were quitting the organisation, accusing other Pacific Island nations of treating them with neglect and contempt.It's a heavy blow for the regional body which sits at the apex of the region's diplomatic architecture.But what does it mean for Australia? Is there a way the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) can be patched back together? And what will happen if those efforts fail?According to the Micronesian leaders, it's all about respect.There are three regional groupings that make up the Pacific Islands region — Polynesia, Melanesia and Micronesia.But the Micronesian nations in PIF — Palau, Nauru, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia — have sometimes complained they are relegated to the organisation's outer orbit.And these resentments flared into life once again when the forum's top job — the position of secretary-general — needed to be filled.Last year the Micronesian nations declared there was an unwritten ""gentleman's agreement"" that it was their turn to fill the position, so their candidate should get the job.More consequentially, they also publicly threatened to quit the body if they didn't get their way.The ""Mekreos Communique"" was meant to be a show of resolve. But instead it stirred resentment from several other Pacific leaders — particularly in Polynesia — who felt that Micronesia's very public declaration was little more than political blackmail.The prospect of consensus looked increasingly remote.It also didn't help that Micronesia's candidate, Gerald Zackios, hails from the Marshall Islands. PIF's Deputy Secretary-General Dr Filimon Manoni is also Marshallese, and some countries could not swallow both top positions going to officials from the same nation.In the end Zackios narrowly lost to a Polynesian candidate, former Cook Islands prime minister Henry Puna.And the result left Micronesian leaders with a choice — make a humiliating retreat from their public threat, or follow through?So they decided to follow through.Or did they?It's too early to tell.So far only one of the five Micronesian nations, Palau, has formally initiated its immediate withdrawal.And the final statement issued by the Micronesian leaders on Tuesday seems to leave the door ever so slightly ajar to them returning.The first draft of the statement prepared for the leaders left little room for manoeuvre. It said that all Micronesian nations would ""act swiftly like the Republic of Palau"" and withdraw from the forum.But the final signed communique is less definitive. There's no reference to Palau and the document stresses the ""final decision rests with the respective governments"" in Micronesia.The withdrawal is not immediate. The four Micronesian nations have set a timetable of one year for them to complete the process.Australia and New Zealand hope that will give Pacific Island nations an opportunity to negotiate some sort of compromise which will allow the forum to stick together.New Zealand's Foreign Ministry has already declared that it hopes Micronesian leaders will reconsider their decision.And Wednesday morning Australia's Minister for the Pacific Zed Seselja also made it clear that Australia would do what it could to help heal the rift.""Obviously these are sovereign nations and they're expressing their views,"" he told the ABC's Pacific Beat program.""And our job is to listen to them and work with them, and hopefully, come to a unified position.""But in the end neither Australia or New Zealand are pretending they will be able to magically engineer a solution from the sidelines.Pacific leaders will engineer their own compromise if they do decide they want to stick together.What shape that compromise takes is another question.One possibility: would Micronesian nations agree to stay if the forum agreed to enshrine the somewhat incorporeal ""gentleman's agreement"" into a formal pact, which would see the plum secretary-general role handed to each region in turn?There are certainly signs that some leaders are keen to keep on talking.In a statement issued late Tuesday Nauru's President Lionel Aingimea seemed to be urging Melanesian and Polynesian nations to find a compromise which all sides could live with.""We [Micronesia] don't want to see this friction. We want to stay united in this Blue Ocean,"" it reads.He also said he didn't ""blame"" anyone for the current impasse, saying ""it's just how things have developed"".It's a curiously passive statement from someone who has just taken the seismic step of severing ties with the region's top body.Aingimea did not sound like a man who is relishing the opportunity to shrug off the shackles of PIF.He sounded like a leader who feels his nation has been caught in inexorable political currents, and who would very much like to be offered a branch.Still, other leaders sound less open to compromise — including the Federated States of Micronesia's President, David Panuelo.""Our decision is quite definitive. I mean, it's very decisive. We've taken those decisions,"" he said Wednesday morning.If the Micronesian nations do ultimately depart, the Pacific Islands Forum will be greatly weakened.The consequences for Australia are substantial, but not earth-shattering.While Pacific Island nations regularly use the forum to ramp up pressure on Australia over climate change, it also offers Australia privileged and automatic access to top-level regional discussions.If PIF splinters, then maintaining that access and influence will require more work.Former senior Pacific official Transform Aqorau says Australia and New Zealand will now ""have to navigate through a myriad of organisations to deal with some of the political issues that fall within the purview of the forum"".But Australia is already beefing up its diplomatic presence in Micronesian nations under the Pacific Step Up, which will help Canberra maintain its ties in the North Pacific.Jonathan Pryke from the Lowy Institute says the split will be an ""unwelcome distraction"" but it ""won't profoundly change the geostrategic landscape for Australia in the Pacific"".""Ultimately all of our day-to-day work in the Pacific won't change. Australia has always prioritised bilateral relationships and will continue to do so,"" he says.""Having a physical diplomatic presence in the North Pacific also puts Australia in a better position to work bilaterally across the region.""The consequences for the region are much bigger.

24,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/cars-that-eat-paradise-narrative-feature/12001916,"While known for pristine beaches and blue skies, Pacific Islands are also polluted with thousands of man-made monuments: rusting cars, trucks and other wreckage.The 40-kilometre road that runs the length of South Tarawa in Kiribati is surprisingly busy: it will take more than an hour to travel its length, about half the time it took before it was paved a few years ago.Travelling the length of any coral atoll can take a very long time, but travelling the width is rarely more than a few minutes' walk.Two or three generations ago, village life generally involved less long-distance travel. Food was sourced or produced locally and needs were met within comparatively easy reach.Many weekly activities now involve greater distances, as people travel further for work, education, health care and commerce: more families have one or even two vehicles, and in densely populated areas, there are a lot of vehicles on the road.But there are also a lot of vehicles on the side of the road: thousands of broken-down cars, trucks, and buses take up front yards, open spaces and the beach.Even when salvageable components have been stripped from an end-of-life vehicle, there remains a lot of unusable debris with very few suitable dumping places.Whole car bodies, thousands of parts, and potentially millions of fragments, end up in the sand, on the rocks, embedded in reefs and in the streams, mangroves and lagoons.Oil and other toxic ﬂuids seep into ground water, paint ﬂakes and plastics enter the ecosystem.The long-term impacts on health are serious, especially for children.The steel will rust away eventually, but myriad toxic components — the chemicals and substances that make up a modern vehicle — will continue poisoning the fragile environment.It's a very similar situation in other atoll nations such as Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands, as well as smaller Paciﬁc Island countries and territories.There just isn't adequate space to dump cars out of sight, as the land area for some of the small atoll nations is tiny: Tuvalu is just 26 square kilometres.End-of-life vehicles (ELV) acutely exemplify the challenges of hard waste management. The highly visible rubbish in densely populated small islands is confronting.Desire and capacity to own a car are increasing, but they often don't last long here. Vehicles degrade rapidly in the highly corrosive and rough conditions of atolls and small islands.Sophisticated service requirements can't be met in remote communities. Modern cars, often second-hand units from Japan, can have very short lives.A repair that might require two hours and cost $500 in Australia could take two months and cost $2,000 on a remote island.Relatively young cars can be written off over what should be a simple repair.Vehicle wrecks make up a signiﬁcant proportion of the hard waste on small islands, where it is cheaper to import a running vehicle than to get rid of a dead one, but they're not the only issue.Demand for Western goods is strong, and businesses are only too happy to proﬁt by importing vast amounts of product.Freight traffic into the Paciﬁc region is one-way when it comes to cargo, commodities and cars: shipping containers ﬁlled with products arrive, but there's very little commercial export from these islands.Containers leave empty, or remain and become hard waste themselves.Long ago, the sea brought life and took away the waste effortlessly. Now the sea brings ships containing products that, when discarded, will not decompose.There are some grounds for optimism: Paciﬁc governments are increasingly engaging with the challenges of waste management, as the burden on limited landmasses becomes greater.Problems are being acknowledged, causes identiﬁed, solutions sought and action taken.Vastly improved collection services and modernised dumping sites are making tangible differences, and there are plans for a deposit system on cars that will help pay for their removal from the islands at the end of their life.As education and awareness have increased, populations are more engaged in waste management activities such as sorting recyclables from general and organic waste.Strong regional partnerships exist through the Secretariat of the Paciﬁc Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), including the Moana Taka Partnership, a waste management project with shipping firm the China Navigation Company.""The aim is to move non-commercial, recyclable waste, from the centre of the Paciﬁc area, to the Paciﬁc rim where it can be responsibly, competently and sustainably recycled,"" said Simon Bennett, General Manager of sustainable development at the China Navigation Company.The Singapore-based company ships the waste away from the islands free of charge, helping address the long-standing issue of freight costs.While there is plenty of space on the ships to take car wrecks away from the islands, the biggest hurdle is finding a place to send them for treatment and recycling.""It's not about space, it's about markets,"" SPREP pollution adviser Tony Talouli said.The next step in the program is for a portable car crusher to be included on the same ship, that will then carry the crushed wrecks away.The goal is to have a circular economy for the whole vehicle, not just the metal.It would be hard to overstate the negative impact of waste on Paciﬁc Island nations. Contamination severely damages fragile environments and ecosystems, while the destruction of beautiful landscapes also affects tourism.But far more important are the effects on the communities themselves: island cultures are inextricably linked to their environments, not only for food and shelter.""There's an impact in terms of our iconic marine species, that's a concern for us,"" SPREP's Director General Kosi Latu said.""Not just because of the need to conserve these iconic species, but these are part of our cultures, and so if they're gone then part of our cultures has also gone.""","Automotive Industry, Environment, Environmental Management, Land Pollution, Marshall Islands, Pacific, Pollution, Recycling and Waste Management, Tuvalu, ",2020-03-14 19:20:20+00:00

""Here it is, but just don't eat it. It doesn't work that way."" From 1946–1958, the US detonated 67 nuclear bombs in the Marshall Islands — some of the largest atomic weapons tests in history — and the area near the test site was evacuated, with locals receiving settlement payouts.In the aftermath, with widespread radiation sickness being reported across the Marshall Islands, radioactive soil, debris, and wreckage was dumped into a nuclear crater on Enewetak Atoll.The crater was capped with cement in 1980 and is officially called the Runit Dome — but locals have nicknamed it The Tomb.The Enewatak people eventually began returning to the islands in the early 1980s following highly controversial talks between the United States and leaders of the Marshall Islands.Amid reports of ongoing aftereffects and illness, a 2012 United Nations report found that the effects of the nuclear tests were long-lasting, which was followed by a 2013 US Department of Energy report which found radioactive materials were leeching out of the Dome, threatening the already tenuous existence of Enewetak locals.Terry Hamilton, a veteran nuclear scientist at the United States Department of Energy who oversees monitoring of the site, told the ABC that while the area is still irradiated, clams and seafood should not be dangerous to eat.""While there are higher levels of plutonium in the environment at the present time, that's not being reflected in terms of the amount of plutonium that's being taken up by the local people,"" he said.His comments will likely be of little comfort to Marshall Islands residents, who have borne the brunt of the nuclear testing aftermath and remain at the centre of the debate about whether the plutonium is causing them to become ill.Local nuclear commissioner Mr Kelen told the ABC that people remain afraid six decades after the tests.""People live out there on the irradiated islands, they survive by eating the fish, clams and everything else that crawls on the lagoon or on land,"" he said. ""They get sick.""But Dr Hamilton maintains that it would be unlikely anyone could ever eat enough clams to get sick. ""While they're eating [them] they're just not eating sufficient [amounts to be] causing any sort discernible effect on the levels of plutonium in their body,"" he said.The site was catapulted back into the international spotlight during the UN secretary-general's visit to the Pacific last month. Antonio Guterres told students in Fiji that he had deep concerns about the impacts climate change could have on the structural integrity of the Dome which he referred to as ""a kind of coffin"". ""I've just been with the President of the Marshall Islands, Hilda Heini, who is very worried because there is a risk of leaking radioactive materials,"" he said. The US Department of Energy has admitted that radioactive water is leaking from the Dome, and that cracks have begun to form in its concrete roof, but Dr Hamilton disputed suggestions of an impending environmental catastrophe. ""The idea that it may lead to some sort of catastrophic event, not only in the local marine environment but across the Pacific, is false,"" he said.Dr Hamilton said that the area near the Dome was already contaminated, but maintained that it was the result of the fallout from the original nuclear tests. ""The total amount of plutonium that's contained in the Runit Dome is very, very low compared with what's already out in the lagoon,"" he said.""I certainly wouldn't be worried about living there from a radiological point of view.""The nuclear scientist has stressed that people living in the region are actually exposed to less radiation than people living in big cities. ""If they were to move away [to other parts of the globe] their total exposure to radiation would not decrease, it would most certainly increase,"" he said. But for Marshall Islands Senator Jack Ading, who represents the Enewetak Atoll, Dr Hamilton's claims are ""not very reassuring"". ""I'm not a scientist. I'm also not a doctor, but they say it's always prudent to get a second opinion no matter how good your doctor is,"" Senator Ading told the ABC. ""[The US] has a history of underestimating the risks created by the contamination of our islands.""We have too much at stake to rely solely on the information provided by US."" But despite the contamination, any further clean up appears unlikely in the near future. ""I think that would be a very difficult exercise … you would need to basically remove the contaminated sediment from the seafloor,"" Dr Hamilton said. ""You'd be looking at millions upon millions of tonnes of material that you would need to move from the atoll, and that in itself would have probably have a more devastating effect on the land.""","Defence Industry, Food Safety, History, Marshall Islands, Pacific, Poisoning, Pollution, Water Pollution, ",2019-06-07 19:01:05+00:00

A massive Buddhist rosary. A heart-shaped te ma (or fish trap) made from 8,000 pairs of ringed venus shells. A display room featuring dismembered medical dummies and fitness equipment, oversized tools and silicone sex toys. A video of an underwater street parade celebrating Santo Nino (baby Jesus), complete with a crucifix-bearing Christ figure — and soldiers wielding assault rifles.Zara Stanhope (curatorial manager for the Asian and Pacific collections, who oversees an in-house curatorium who formulate the exhibition) says: ""APT has never been about defining a geographic zone … or political imperatives"", describing it rather as a ""framework for the perspective [of artists]"" from the region.This approach allows the voice of the artist (rather than the curator) to be heard loudest: each work is allowed its complexity and nuance, rather than being shoehorned into a theme.In turn, viewers are more free to forge their own meanings and connections between works. The imagination runs wild.It also means that the curators for APT are able to pick the best and most interesting works from the region, unrestricted by theme.Of course, there are certain aspects of APT9 that distinguish it from its antecedents: there are countries presenting work for the first time (including Laos and the Marshall Islands); there are more textile works in this edition than APT8; and there are more First Nations artists on the line-up than ever before.And it is possible to see recurring preoccupations throughout the show: colonisation and its ongoing legacy; nature and the environment; spirituality; cultural heritage; uncovered histories.Reuben Keehan, curator of contemporary Asian art, says he only recently identified a seam of ""cabinet of curiosity"" (or wunderkammer) works that runs throughout the exhibition — works that, subconsciously or deliberately, riff on the Renaissance-era mode of presenting objects within purpose-built cabinets.""What does that say about the present moment, that so many artists are doing that [kind of work]?"" Keehan ponders.""You could argue that it's got something to do with trying to make sense of the sheer amount of information we're surrounded by. ""Or is it that artists are curating their own mini spaces, by bringing these different objects together and constructing relationships between them?""My Forest Is Not Your Garden, by Singaporean artists Donna Ong and Robert Zhao Renhui, mimics the museum display using kitsch bric-a-brac and scientific objects alongside archival printed materials, photography and exuberant arrangements of plastic tropical plants and animals.Their installation pokes and picks away at the fraught history of the Cabinet of Curiosity, which was used by the European elite to present objects brought back from imperial assignments abroad. It questions the fantasy of the ""tropical forest"" (What is it? Who constructs it, why, and how?), particularly in relation to the concrete jungle of contemporary Singapore.Other APT artists have used the Cabinet of Curiosity format in this more literal sense (Anne Noble with her cabinet-bound beehive; Chen Zhe's displays of her own photography).But Keehan also points to more oblique, conceptual iterations of the idea: Qiu Zhijie's massive foyer wall painting, which is a map of ideas rather than geography; and Nona Garcia's multi-panel work in which she ""documents"", in paint, parts of a tree outside her studio that was cut down for urban development.Ruth McDougall, curator of Pacific Art, has identified another throughline for APT9: artists whose work engages with notions of wealth and value beyond capital and property.One of the most literal examples of this is the monumental arrangement of Tutana and Loloi (rings of shell-threaded cane) in the GOMA foyer, which constitute ""banks"" of Diwarra (""shell money"") used by the Gunantuna (Toloi people) of East New Britain (a province of Papua New Guinea).Other artists push back against Western notions of value: Aotearoa New Zealand jewellery artist Areta Wilkinson re-positions the value of the ""precious item"" as a matter of knowledge and relationships (with ancestors and land); and photographer and collage artist Kapulani Landgraf superimposes ancient totems and symbols on the hyper-developed and commodified landscape of contemporary Hawai'i, pitting commercial values against her forebears' systems of belief and value (which cherish connection with and custodianship of land). In the collective project Women's Wealth, alternative systems of value and wealth are not just on display, but are integral to the process and outcomes. The project produced a room full of works by women from Bougainville and the Solomon Islands, including ceremonial fans and ""hoods"", and bags. They are objects that have value beyond their materiality: they signify authority in some cases, and the making of them represents connection with kin and country. They also represent cultural resilience in the face of commercial, environmental and industrial forces. But McDougall, who worked three years on the project in tandem with co-curator Sana Balai and Baku women and artists Taloi Havini and Marilyn Havini, says the project is as much about building relationships with that community and fostering intergenerational transfer of knowledge as about the works themselves.""The project wasn't just about putting something on display in the gallery — it was about 'How can we take these women from this place to this place, and do that with integrity'.""Women's Wealth is one of several collaborative, community-driven projects in APT9 that demonstrate the institution of the Gallery being shaped by outside voices — co-curators and artists.Others include Tungaru: The Kiribati Project led by artist Chris Charteris, and the Marshall Islands Jaki-ed mat-weaving project, which involved a three-week workshop with local experts and Marshallese poet, teacher and artist Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner.These voices join the multiple voices of the internal curatorium (which is comprised of eight curators from QAGOMA) in shaping the APT9 exhibition. The result — compounded by the lack of overarching theme — is not one authorial voice but many; not one simple vision, but complexity. It's a complexity that does justice to the region, and helps us understand it, says Stanhope.""We're part of Asia and the Pacific — and they're complex, as is Australia. So any way that we can get to know these neighbours better, understand those different world views and share their cultures, the richer our lives will be.""The 9th Asia-Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art runs until April 28 at Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art, Brisbane.The writer travelled to Brisbane as a guest of QAGOMA.","Arts, Culture and Entertainment, Bangladesh, Brisbane, Cambodia, China, Contemporary Art, Fine Art Photography, Installation Art, Japan, Kiribati, Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of, Lao People s Democratic Republic, Libraries, Museums and Galleries, Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Painting, Papua New Guinea, Performing Arts, Sculpture, Taiwan, Torres Strait Islands, Vietnam, Visual Art, ",2018-11-28 19:08:20+00:00

We've been waiting what, 50, 60 years, nothing happened,"" he said.""Now we're confronted with climate change, no-one is coming to our aid.""We have to do something as a sovereign country and we need to chart our own destiny.""But supporters of the digital finance strategy are apparently unaware of the enormous impact cryptocurrencies have on the environment, because of the vast numbers of computers that are required to make the system work.The director of the Centre for Software Practice at the University of Western Australia, Dr David Glance, said the two best known currencies — Bitcoin and Ethereum — use as much electricity in a year as the whole of Venezuela.""If you convert that into CO2 emissions, it's massive,"" Dr Glance said.""So the idea that Marshall Islands are going to be contributing to their own demise by using a technology which consumes far more energy than normal transactions on the internet is something that they've overlooked, or chosen to overlook.""So even if the digital currency takes off, the Marshall Islands Government would appear to be taking aim at their own feet on the question of global warming.Giff Johnson, editor of the Marshall Islands Journal, said it was not as if the Government needed the money.He said he believes the problem is that the money is not being well spent.""What's going to change the picture is when people are willing to be held accountable for their work performance in government, and until that time, no amount of money is going to improve the basic health, education, and social indicators in this country,"" Mr Johnson said.It took a week of vigorous debate to get the Marshall Islands digital currency act through Parliament, but in the end the bill passed with a clear majority by 20 votes to eight.""It comes with a premium of being the first and I think it's an opportunity for us to write the script of how it should be done in a most proper, transparent and robust manner,"" Mr Paul said.""The internet is there for the taking, the possibilities are there, but we're also mindful that there are risks associated with it.""Risks that many would argue the Marshalls can do without, having only just been removed from the European Union's money laundering blacklist, but Mr Paul said there would be safeguards in place.Dr Glance said part of that security process will require people who use the new digital sovereign, as the currency will be called, to offer proof of identity before they can transact.""They've labelled that protocol, iokwe, which means hello in Marshallese, and essentially that means that it's all traceable,"" Dr Glance said.""That would reduce the incentive first of all for people to invest in the currency, and secondly for people to actually use it.""Furthermore, even though the Marshalls Government says its aim is to establish the sovereign as the national currency, it has no plans to abandon its long-established links with the US dollar.""Digital currency is there to be utilised in the information and the internet age, and that is an option for those who are engaging in those kinds of transactions, but we're not transitioning out of the US dollar,"" Mr Paul said.Mr Johnson said that was just as well, as most people in the country are not ready for digital finance.""In order to use digital currency, you have to be in the digital world,"" he said.""Of course we do have thousands of cell phone users here, but your average person doesn't have that capability here, and also the minimum wage is only $US2.50 an hour, so I think there are lot of issues in all of this, for the local population's engagement.""To emphasise the point, Dr Glance said internet in Marshall Islands is slow and expensive, as is the cellular network which is only 2G.""They're not a digital nation,"" he said.Dr Glance said questions were also being asked about the Israeli start-up group that put the idea of a digital currency to the Marshalls' Government in the first place.""Who's going to monitor it, what's that monitoring going to be used for, what privacy measures will be in place, what does the Israeli company have to do with all of this?"" he said.""If they're providing the technology, is that run out of Israel? Is the data of the people of Marshall Islands going to be secure?""Mr Paul said there would be an initial coin offering (ICO) capped at 24 million sovereigns, and the profits would be split.""Twelve million of that will be going to our partner, the other 12 million will be the Marshalls, and in return they are going to be the ones providing all the technical know-how, the investment capital needed to get this thing off the ground and help us manage it,"" he said.While the Marshall Islands Government and its Israeli partners ponder a date for the roll out of their digital sovereign, a huge amount of suspicion surrounds ICOs, to the extent where they have been banned in China and South Korea.

It was the worst flooding the Marshallese had experienced in 30 years and the third time the capital Majuro had been flooded in one year.""What we've experienced in the past four to five years especially is an increase in tidal flooding,"" Ms Jetnil Kijiner said.""All this water rushes over these sea walls we've made to protect ourselves and it washes away graves, it crashes into homes, the salt dries up our crops, and people are left homeless in certain situations.""When Ms Jetnil-Kijiner told this story at the UN summit, finishing with her evocative poem Dear Matafele Peinem, it resulted in a standing ovation from world leaders.The media and others began publishing and broadcasting Ms Jetnil-Kijiner's writings and performances, and in early 2017 the University of Arizona Press published her first collection of poetry.She is now scheduled to appear at Womadelaide's Planet Talks, joining Carteret Islands climate campaigner Ursula Rakova, human rights barrister Julian Burnside, and former World Vision Australia chief executive Tim Costello, for a talk entitled Climate Justice and the Human Face of Climate Change.But the real point of Ms Jetnil-Kijiner's work is to inspire world leaders to help her country ""win the most important race of all — the race to save humanity"".She said the slow speed of change, or a lack of definitive action from larger, more polluting countries, was a source of ""super frustration"".""They're not recognising how their own actions affect the rest of the world,"" Ms Jetnil-Kijiner said.""Sometimes in a lot of cases, they're [governments] not recognising the needs of their own people because even their own people and their own citizens are fighting for climate change action.""The Adani coal mine, for example, has been an issue that I've learnt about from my friends in Australia who are trying to shut down that coal mine.""She even found it hard to point to a large country where she was genuinely impressed by its efforts to reduce carbon emissions.""Every time I think one country is doing great, then I hear something else about what rollbacks and cutbacks [to emissions reduction policy] they're doing, so it's sort of difficult,"" Ms Jetnil-Kijiner said.The World Bank's Data Catalogue lists Australia's CO2 emissions per capita in 2014 as 15.4 tonnes; this is similar to the US (16.5) and Canada (15.1) but above Russia (11.9) and China (7.5).Australia's total emissions that year was 361,262 kilotons, while China produced 10.29 million kt, the US 5.25 million kt, Russia 1.7 million kt and Canada 537,193kt. By comparison, the Marshall Islands produced just 1.9 tonnes per capita, or 103 kilotons of emissions in total.Ms Jetnil-Kijiner co-founded the non-profit group Jo-Jikum which aims to ""empower Marshallese youth to seek solutions to environmental impacts on our islands"".Asked if a mass migration may become necessary due to rising seas, and by when that may occur, Ms Jetnil-Kijiner said she met a climate scientist last year and wanted to know: ""Do we have a chance?""""He wasn't really able to give me a conclusive answer. I've read articles that claim the worst of climate change impacts will hit the Pacific in as little as 10 years; some people say we have 50 years.""I'm willing to bet we have less than 50 though, considering how fast climate impacts are changing the world.""Ms Jetnil-Kijiner said she drew inspiration from Marshallese elders who had been fighting for climate change to be recognised as a serious threat for years.This included long-time political leader Tony de Brum who helped negotiate independence from the US in the 1970s, and campaigned regularly about the negative impacts of climate change and American nuclear testing on the islands from 1946 to 1958.He died last year aged 72.""If my elders could have fought for as long as they did, then I should be able to continue to fight as well,"" Ms Jetnil-Kijiner said.""And I look at the younger generation, my daughter, the youth that I work with back home with the non-profit Jo-Jikum.""They also give me hope because they're the ones that will continue the work after I pass on.""She said she'd been ""overwhelmed"" by the reaction to her UN speech and considered it a tribute to the power of poetry and arts, particularly in a subject so often spoken of in figures and percentages.""I think that art and poetry tend to not really be considered in this fight, and I've seen it really transform people and get people to be motivated. It basically humanises the issue.Ms Jetnil-Kijiner talks at Woamdelaide in Botanic Park on March 11 at 3:00pm.She will also make an appearance at Adelaide Writers' Week, which runs from March 3 to March 8 in the Pioneer Women's Memorial Garden.

Like much of the Marshall Islands it was barely a metre above sea level.The lip of Enewetak's sunken volcano now forms the world's second largest ocean lagoon, its spectacular azure waters are straight out of a tourist brochure for an unspoiled Pacific paradise.But this lagoon hides a dark, dirty secret.Its depths harbour one of the most toxic substances on the planet — plutonium.That's why we had come to Enewetak.This atoll had been the scene of 43 United States atomic tests during the 1940s and 50s.Some were so big, whole islands had been vaporised by the blasts, one by a thermonuclear bomb called ""Ivy Mike"".Despite its rather benign-sounding name, Ivy Mike lit up Enewetak on November 1, 1952, its fireball spawning a mushroom cloud 160 kilometres across.The blast left a 2km-wide crater where the island of Elugelab had been just moments before.In the late 1970s, 4,000 US troops were sent to Enewetak to collect 80,000 cubic metres of radioactive debris and soil left behind by the tests.It was dumped into an old bomb crater, and covered by a 45-centimetre-thick concrete lid, a structure known as ""the dome"".These old prop-driven bangers are used around the world as commuter planes, military transports and cargo workhorses, and can land on the roughest and shortest of strips.However, a quick Wikipedia search revealed eight fatal incidents involving this particular model plane in the past decade. Our friendly pilot explained this particular beast had been purchased in Kathmandu from the Nepalese national airline, where it had been used for hauling passengers and freight over the Himalayas.The second-hand Dornier was about 20 years old when Air Marshall Islands picked it up for a pretty good price.From the world's tallest peaks, the twin turboprop was now ferrying people and cargo over the featureless, flat expanses of the Pacific.Despite its sagging looks, the old clunker got us to Enewetak.Whether it would get us off was another story.While we had chartered it to pick us up in a week, we had heard countless stories in Majuro of people stranded on the outer islands waiting for a plane that never came.At least we had enough Spam and canned beans to last us several weeks.Our life in Enewetak quickly settled into a gentle island rhythm.A breakfast of fried Spam and eggs; filming in the early morning before the heat became unbearable; a lunch of instant noodles and a brief siesta; more filming in the afternoon; and then a swim in the lagoon.With no television, internet or alcoholic beverages, our evenings were spent watching DVDs in our demountable.(We all agreed that the recent remake of the Magnificent Seven was a cinematic travesty).Other than the kitchen and bathroom, there were only two rooms.But there were three of us.Initially, when contemplating the sleeping arrangements, an earnest discussion was had about our snoring capabilities.Ben quickly convinced Greg and I that he would win by several hundred decibels, meaning he would require a space of his own.So Greg and I settled into the room at the other end of the demountable where we thought we'd be safe.But Ben quickly proved to be a snorer of rare abilities — both in constancy and volume.I doubt Enewetak has heard anything that loud since the last atomic test in 1958.Not even a set of earplugs could silence the fearsome din emanating from the other end of the shack.While the island was only a couple of kilometres long, we still needed a vehicle to lug around our TV gear, especially in the suffocating humidity.In the absence of an Avis or Budget rent-a-car franchise, we had only one transport option — the Enewetak police.Every morning Sergeant Terry and his officers would pull up in the police ute out the front of our demountable for a day of shepherding us about.Driving along Enewetak's only road, Sergeant Terry would deftly dodge potholes, pigs and curious chickens, while dropping off supplies to locals along our route.After a day touring the island with Enewetak's finest, it would be time to head home to our hovel and prepare dinner.While this would inevitably involve a can opener, we would do our best to enhance whatever substance lay within, adding the odd limp carrot or wilting chilli from the fridge.Taking dinner preparations in turns, Greg, Ben and I would do our best to offer up something remotely digestible, though Ben's fondness for oily peanut butter was cause for some consternation.Despite the absence of the internet, a flushing toilet and fine dining, the week on Enewetak slipped by quickly.On our last morning we packed up our gear, ready for the flight out.We must have been confident the old Himalayan workhorse would show up because we gave away our remaining supplies (failing to remember the plight of another Foreign Correspondent team in the Pacific that did the same, only to have to plead for their food and water back when their boat failed to materialise as agreed, stranding them for days).The left-over chips and lollies were greeted by the locals with much more enthusiasm than the unopened cans of beans.Miraculously, the plane arrived right on time, the pilot disembarking the cockpit wearing the Air Marshall Islands uniform of a T-shirt, shorts and sneakers.Right on time again we took off, turning away from Enewetak and its beautiful but toxic lagoon.Over the drone of the Dornier's props, we gave each other the thumbs up.We had survived the snoring, the Spam, and the sobriety.Mark Willacy's story can be seen on the Foreign Correspondent website and on iview.","Climate Change, Journalism, Marshall Islands, Nuclear Issues, ",2017-11-27 21:27:39+00:00

The army did have special radiation suits and respirators for handling the left-over atomic waste on the atoll, but the young soldiers were only allowed to wear them on special occasions.""The [protective suits] were for photo ops,"" the former communications specialist with the US Army's 84th Engineer Battalion recalls.""I know once when I believe 60 Minutes was there, they did [let us wear them]. We were just issued our normal warm weather gear … shorts, tee-shirts, hats and jungle boots and that's it.""Androl was one of about 4,000 US troops sent to Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands between 1977 and 1979 to scrape up the contaminated remnants of the United States' atomic testing program.The US government decided to use soldiers for the clean-up, because employing specialist nuclear workers would have doubled the cost. ""I'd never even heard of Enewetak. I never knew that there were 43 nuclear tests out there,"" Androl, who was 22-years old when he was deployed to the atoll, says.Some of those bombs were the among the most powerful ever detonated, and they left behind a toxic legacy that will live on for thousands of years.""One of the attempted nuclear weapons explosions didn't work,"" Michael Gerrard, the director of the Earth Institute at New York's Columbia University, says. ""So the plutonium was just broken apart by the conventional explosion, leading to about 400 little chunks of plutonium that were spread around the atoll.""The plutonium on Enewetak has a radioactive half-life of more than 24,000 years, and the US clean-up troops were ordered to place the shattered pieces into plastic bags and dump them into a crater left behind by an old atomic bomb test. One-millionth of a gram of plutonium is potentially harmful, and can cause cancer decades after first exposure. ""They'd have us walk around and pick up loose pieces, and just gather up whatever we could, throw it in a pile,"" Androl says.It's estimated that 85,000 cubic metres of radioactive material was collected and dumped, including contaminated soil, concrete, and military equipment.""It was a very dirty operation,"" Ken Kasik, another of the men sent to Enewetak as part of the clean-up, says. ""[The veterans are] all sick, they're all dying, and it's because of the radiation.""Kasik can barely rise from his chair to greet me when I arrive to see him.We were supposed to meet at his home in Hawaii.But by the time I land, he is seriously ill in the intensive care unit in Honolulu's Straub Medical Centre, and is tethered to drips and monitoring machines. ""About three-and-a-half years ago I had so many cancers on me, I couldn't work anymore. They ripped me apart,"" he says.This time it's not cancer that has forced Ken Kasik to be rushed to the ICU, but a brain aneurism he says is directly linked to his time on Enewetak and the atomic fall-out there.""When those bombs go off, in Enewetak, that's coral sand,"" Kasik says. ""That just gets pulverised and comes back down as baby powder, and it was on everything, everywhere. The guys would come home, take off their sunglasses, [and their faces] would be white.""""I never had any clue that dust could literally get into your lungs,"" Jim Androl says from his home in the suburbs of Las Vegas. ""You breathe it, you drink it, you eat it, you swim in it. Every day for six months, 24/7.""The problem for Enewetak clean-up veterans like Androl and Kasik, is that successive United States governments have refused to recognise them and their comrades as atomic veterans. This means they cannot access health benefits or radiation exposure compensation. Other atomic veterans, like those involved in the original atomic testing program in the Pacific in the 1940s and 1950s that left behind the waste on Enewetak and Bikini atolls, were covered for more than 20 specific types of cancers.  ""Our boys worked six-month tours on a dirty island, and the government says, 'You were never there',"" Kasik says. ""We were never acknowledged…we don't exist.""Like Kasik, Androl has suffered serious health problems over the years that he blames on his six-month tour at Enewetak.""He had his gall bladder out … two weeks [later] they found a seven-and-a-half-pound tumour, cancerous tumour in his abdomen,"" Androl's wife Bev says.""I suffer from roughly 40 to 45 residuals from the cancer,"" Androl says. ""I've got pancreatitis, I've got a spot on my liver that they're watching.""As well as cancers, veterans complain of brittle bones and even of birth defects in their children.The US military insists there is no connection between veterans' illnesses and the clean-up on Enewetak, saying their radiation exposure was well within safe limits.A two-year campaign by Enewetak veterans to get Congress to give them medical benefits has been unsuccessful. ""I think mostly they're trying to get health coverage, medical care because they've got terrible bills. Really high bills from hospitals, because of their treatment,"" Giff Johnson, the publisher of the Marshall Islands Journal, the country's only newspaper, says. There has never been a formal study of the health of these men, many of whom are now in their late 50s and early 60s. But an unofficial social media survey of more than 400 Enewetak clean-up veterans found that 20 percent had reported cancers of some type.The life they live is a far cry from the photos Ken Kasik took at the time, of young men in their prime.We asked your thoughts on the US military's response to the veterans' illnesses. Read the discussion below.""It just breaks our heart, You know, they're dying before they're 60. It's ridiculous,"" Bev Androl says.""God, there's been so many [who have died],"" Androl says of his former comrades. ""We just lost one two weeks ago. We lost one about six months before that. They told me I'd be dead by now. We're nobody, we don't matter, our family's lives don't matter."" The people of the Marshall Islands also suffered terrible heath impacts from 12 years of atomic testing in their homeland, including increased rates of thyroid and other cancers, as well as birth defects.Whole islands were evacuated, and many people are still not allowed to return to live in their home villages decades on.Like the US clean-up veterans, the Marshallese who suffered were never properly compensated.A nuclear claims tribunal set up by the Marshall Islands and the United States awarded more than $2 billion dollars to victims of the atomic testing program — less than $4 million was ever paid.""America dumped all of their worst rubbish to the Marshallese, and abandoned them with it. And we don't want to hear about it,"" Kasik says.""It's a disgusting shame.

""The children understand that we have a poison in our island.""It's ""Manit Day"" on Enewetak Atoll, a celebration of Marshall Islands culture when the Pacific nation's troubled past seems a distant memory.Schoolchildren sit cross-legged on the coral sands as they sing of the islands and atolls, the sunshine and the breeze; ""flowers and moonlight, swaying palm trees"". They were born decades after the last nuclear explosion ripped through the warm Pacific air with a thunderous roar. But it's hard to escape the long echo of the bombs.""Gone are the days when we live in fear, fear of the bombs, guns and nuclear,"" they sing. ""This is the time ... this is my country, this is my land.""But those old fears, thought to be long buried, are threatening to reawaken in their island paradise.On an atoll in the far-flung west of the Marshall Islands, halfway between Australia and Hawaii, sits ""the dome"".Approaching from the water, it's hard to appreciate the true scale of the concrete vault, with its shallow profile obscured by palm trees and scrub.But from the air it looks like a giant flying saucer has crashed on the tip of a deserted island.Buried beneath this vast disc is 85,000 cubic metres of radioactive waste — a toxic legacy from the dawning of the thermonuclear age.In the late 1970s, Runit Island, on the remote Enewetak Atoll, was the scene of the largest nuclear clean-up in United States history. Highly contaminated debris left over from dozens of atomic weapons tests was dumped into a 100-metre wide bomb crater on the tip of the uninhabited island.US Army engineers sealed it up with a half-metre thick concrete cap almost the size of an Australian football ground, then left the island.Now with sea levels rising, water has begun to penetrate the dome.A report commissioned by the US Department of Energy in 2013 found that radioactive materials were leeching out, threatening the already tenuous existence of Enewetak locals.""That dome is the connection between the nuclear age and the climate change age,"" says Marshall Islands climate change activist Alson Kelen. ""It'll be a very devastating event if it really leaks. We're not just talking the Marshall Islands, we're talking the whole Pacific.""The United States detonated 43 atomic bombs around the island chain in the 1940s and 50s.Four of Enewetak's 40 islands were completely vaporised by the tests, with one thermonuclear blast leaving a two-kilometre-wide crater where an island had been just moments before.Enewetak's population had been re-located to another island in the Marshalls ahead of the tests.""That dome is the connection between the nuclear age and the climate change age.""Residents would only be allowed to return home more than three decades later — some on the island today can still recall returning to Enewetak as children.As part of the clean-up process, Washington set aside funds to build the dome as a temporary storage facility, and initial plans included lining the porous bottom of its crater with concrete.But in the end, that was deemed too expensive.""The bottom of the dome is just what was left behind by the nuclear weapons explosion,"" says Michael Gerrard, the chair of Columbia University's Earth Institute in New York. ""It's permeable soil. There was no effort to line it. And therefore, the seawater is inside the dome.""Locals rarely set foot on Runit Island. They're fearful of the lingering radiation from the dome and because it's been ruled off-limits.To this day, only three islands along Enewetak Atoll's slender rim are considered safe enough for human habitation.""[The other islands were] too hot, too radioactive to worry about,"" says Giff Johnson, publisher of the Marshall Islands Journal, the country's only newspaper. ""There was no point [cleaning them up].""After the fall-out from the atomic testing, life for the people of Enewetak went from a traditional existence of fishing and subsistence living to one where the waters that once supported their livelihoods were now polluted.On the main island, where most of the atoll's few hundred people now live, concerns about the radioactive contamination of the food chain has seen a shift away from a traditional diet of fish and coconut. The US Department of Energy has even banned exports of fish and copra from Enewetak because of the ongoing contamination.The vast bulk of foodstuffs are now brought into the island by barge, and that means islanders are reliant on imported canned and processed goods like Spam that have triggered health problems such as diabetes. The shelves of Enewetak's only store are largely filled with American brand chocolate bars, lollies and potato chips.Locals sometimes visit Runit to scavenge from scrap copper left behind by the Americans, selling it for a few dollars to a Chinese merchant.For 30 years, Jack Niedenthal has helped the people of neighbouring Bikini Atoll fight for compensation for the 23 atomic tests conducted there. ""To me, it's like this big monument to America's giant f--k up,"" says Niedenthal. ""This could cause some really big problems for the rest of mankind if all that goes underwater, because it's plutonium and cement.""Some of the debris buried beneath the dome includes plutonium-239, a fissile isotope used in nuclear warheads which is one of the most toxic substances on earth. It has a radioactive half-life of 24,100 years.From the top of the dome, the view is dominated by ocean — the rolling waves of the Pacific to the east, the calm azure surface of the atoll lagoon to the west.A deep bomb crater from another atomic test is carved into the coral just a few metres away.Despite Runit Island being officially off-limits, the dome lies unmarked and unguarded.Its position on the very edge of the shoreline reinforces just how vulnerable and exposed this nuclear waste dump is.""We call it the tomb. The children understand that we have a poison in our island.""Cracks are visible in the dome's surface and brackish liquid pools around its rim.""Already the sea sometimes washes over [the dome] in a large storm,"" says Columbia University's Michael Gerrard.""The United States Government has acknowledged that a major typhoon could break it apart and cause all of the radiation in it to disperse.""While Professor Gerrard would like the US to reinforce the dome, a 2014 US Government report says a catastrophic failure of the structure would not necessarily lead to a change in the contamination levels in the waters surrounding it.""I'm persuaded that the radiation outside the dome is as bad as the radiation inside the dome,"" says Professor Gerrard. ""And therefore, it is a tragic irony that the US Government may be right, that if this material were to be released that the already bad state of the environment around there wouldn't get that much worse.""But that is cold comfort to the people of Enewetak, who fear they may have to be relocated once again if the dome collapses or crumbles.""If it does [crack] open most of the people here will be no more,"" says Ms Aningi.

The United States is continuing to work with the Marshall Islands to provide health care and environmental monitoring of several affected islands, he said.Nearly 2,000 people marched in a Japanese city to mark the 60th anniversary of the nuclear test at Bikini atoll.The 1954 test contaminated the Japanese tuna fishing boat Daigo Fukuryu Maru (Lucky Dragon V), which was near the atoll when the test occurred.The ship's chief radioman Aikichi Kuboyama died of acute organ malfunction nearly seven months later at the age of 40, while 15 others among the boat's 23 crew members died of cancer and other causes later.While the precise cause of Mr Kuboyama's death has been disputed, the incident sparked an anti-nuclear movement in Japan nine years after the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the closing days of World War II.Some 1,800 people marched Saturday to Kuboyama's grave in the port city of Yaizu, 170 kilometres southwest of Tokyo.The city has held similar events to commemorate the incident for three decades, while the boat has been refitted and put on display at a memorial hall in Tokyo since 1976 with about 100,000 visitors every year.""I want to see nuclear power abolished,"" Akira Ibi, a Yaizu citizen, told the Jiji Press news agency, adding he also wanted to get rid of a nearby nuclear power plant on the Pacific coast. The Fukushima crisis, sparked off by a massive earthquake and tsunami, has left tens of thousands temporarily homeless after the nuclear plant meltdown that spewed radiation into the environment.Bikini islander Hinton Johnson criticised the level of compensation the displaced Bikinians receive from the US-provided funds.""Today, each person receives $46 per month or a little over one dollar per day,"" he said during the ceremony.Although the Nuclear Claims Tribunal had awarded the Bikinians more than $560 million in compensation and nuclear test clean up funding, there was no fund to pay them from, he said.""We ask the US and Marshall Islands governments to provide the money for the tribunal's award for the time we've been homeless and unable to return to our homeland,"" Mr Johnson said.AFP","Environment, Environmental Health, Health, Marshall Islands, Nuclear Issues, Pacific, ",2014-03-01 03:24:49+00:00

Rico Ishi is the co-ordinator of the youth delegates attending the Nuclear Futures workshops.She says one of the aims of the workshops is to generate interest among young people who may have forgotten their parents' survival stories.  ""When you come down to the third generation it really depends... some people don't even know, some people are fully active and are enthusiastic of those issues,"" Ms Ishi told Pacific Beat.""We want to inspire more youth who have the similar background but are not fully interested yet."" Ms Ishi says while revisiting the stories would be painful, it was important to remember the past. ""There are some pains you have to take to achieve something more important, something more important for the future generation to come, those memories shall not be forgotten,"" she said.The thermonuclear explosion in the Marshall Islands contaminated four inhabited atolls called Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap, and Utrik. The local populations, many of whom suffered prolonged illness from their exposure to the fall-out, were evacuated to other atolls and have been unable to return home for decades.We want to train these future community leaders to help them collect the histories of their families and the community, so that they can continue recording, preserving and sharing these stories.The workshop is principally funded through the Nuclear Futures creative arts program which is assisted by the Australian Government.Australian multi-media artists Jessie Boylan and Linda Dement will help facilitate the Marshall Islands workshop.Nuclear Futures creative producer Paul Brown said the workshop is an early outcome of a three-year creative arts program responding to the atomic age and its legacy and recognising the resilience of survivor communities.Workshop co-convenor and associate professor Robert Jacobs, from the Hiroshima Peace Institute, says the recent Fukushima reactor meltdown was a reminder for the need to remember the nuclear past.""We want to train these future community leaders to help them collect the histories of their families and the community, so that they can continue recording, preserving and sharing these stories,"" Professor Jacobs said.""In many ways the unfolding tragedy of the Fukushima reactor meltdowns and contamination reprises the historical failure of governments from the cold war and beyond to respond to the needs of civilian populations.""","Asia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Marshall Islands, Nuclear Issues, Pacific, United States, ",2014-02-28 04:04:41+00:00

More than a year later – having lost his shipmate to starvation and apparently surviving by catching birds and fish with his bare hands and drinking turtle blood – he washed up on Ebon Atoll, part of the Marshall Islands, 12,500 kilometres away. Now, a second question has arisen: does his story really stack up?""It does sound like an incredible story, and I'm not sure if I believe his story,"" Gee Bing, acting secretary of foreign affairs for the Marshall Islands, said.""When we saw him, he was not really thin compared to other survivors in the past. I may have some doubts.""Mr Alvarenga told The Telegraph that he had just killed a bird to eat when he spotted some trees in the distance.""I cried, 'Oh God'. I got to land and had a mountain of sleep. In the morning I woke up and heard a rooster and saw chickens and saw a small house."" Mr Alvarenga says he survived his 13-month journey by eating fish and birds and drinking rainwater, turtle blood and his own urine.Nick Vroomans, director of Staying Alive Survival Services in Queensland, told ABC News Online Mr Alvarenga's story of survival is plausible.He says Mr Alvarenga may have benefitted from environmental factors in this part of the world, particularly the prevalence of fresh rain water and animal life. ""He and other people who have been in the Pacific seem to have a better chance of surviving long-term,"" Mr Vroomans said.""The environmental conditions on the Pacific side (of Mexico), particularly around South America and Central America, are quite conducive to people being able to find food and get water.""Obviously you would be able to pick up rain water because it would appear he had no method of making salt water safe to drink."" Mr Vroomans says drinking your own urine - which Mr Alvarenga says he did - is only beneficial if you are otherwise hydrated. But catching fish and birds would have been possible given that, out on the ocean, both would have congregated near the boat as a place to shelter and feed. ""Small fish come underneath boats because it's shady and it's cooler; where you have small fish, you have large fish,"" Mr Vroomans said.Mr Vroomans says it is possible to eat both species raw - provided you stay away from the fish guts - and that the sailor's claim he drank turtle blood makes sense. ""I've had turtle blood myself and it is extremely rich in protein,"" Mr Vroomans said.""That would have made a massive difference to him. Protein is very important in a survival situation because you need to repair your body tissues.""Survival expert Bob Cooper says the story is believable because of the type of vessel Mr Alvarenga was on.""That would have had a bunk and it probably would have had good shade,"" he said.Oceanographers say it is possible, given the prevailing winds and currents, for a boat drifting from western Mexico to end up in the Marshall Islands.  University of Technology Sydney senior research fellow Martina Doblin says the general direction of surface currents in the Pacific Ocean is consistent with the westward movement of Mr Alvarenga's vessel.I've had turtle blood myself and it is extremely rich in protein. That would have made a massive difference to him.""It is still absolutely remarkable, though,"" she said.A 1953 study by an American oceanographer that tracked the pumice spewed from the eruption of a volcano on Mexico's west coast found it did reach the Marshall Islands.It moved 18 centimetres per second, taking about 560 days to reach the remote group of islands.Mr Cooper says how Mr Alvarenga dealt with his situation psychologically would have been a major factor in his survival.""Some people have been in less stressful situations and just given up,"" he said.""Survival is a mind game - never, ever give up.""Mr Vroomans agrees, adding that the possibility of rescue would have presented a significant psychological challenge. ""It would be interesting to find out how many boats went past him that didn't see him, and how many times he thought he might be rescued but wasn't."" He says, in survival situations, accepting your circumstances can lead you to make more logical decisions. ""Some people fall into despair and they end up dying very quickly,"" he said.Mr Alvarenga is being treated for dehydration and joint pain in the Marshall Islands capital Majuro but is in a stable condition.Mr Bing said Mr Alvarenga had been fingerprinted to confirm his identity and the government was trying to communicate with Mexican and El Salvador authorities regarding repatriation.","Accidents, Disasters and Accidents, Human Interest, Maritime Accidents and Incidents, Marshall Islands, ",2014-02-04 05:19:31+00:00

Smelling just like coconut biscuits straight out of the oven, the exhaust is a big improvement on an old diesel engine belching acrid black smoke.""It smells sweet. You can put your nose right up to the exhaust,"" Witon Barry said, assistant manager of the Tobolar Copra processing plant in the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro.All over the Pacific power authorities, private companies and entrepreneurs have been experimenting with coconut oil as an alternative to diesel fuel for vehicles, power generators and even ships.""The idea goes right the way back to Mr Rudolf Diesel. He invented the combustion engine to use peanut oil,"" Jerry Kramer said, chief executive of Pacific International, a company pioneering the use of coconut oil in the Marshall Islands.The use of coconut oil received a boost in the past couple of years as oil prices hit record heights and coconut oil fell to around $US550 ($655) a tonne in the volatile world commodity markets.Coconut trees are found everywhere in the Pacific's tropical islands. The dried white flesh, known as copra, from six to 10 coconuts produces a litre of oil, making the substitution for expensive diesel seem a no-brainer.But ironically the growth in the use of biofuels worldwide has helped push the price of crop oils higher and coconut oil now fetches nearly $1,190 a tonne.""There is strong demand for vegetable oils, there is a huge demand in the US and Europe,"" said Jan Cloin, the energy adviser at SOPAC, the Secretariat of the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission based in Suva.""The Pacific island countries could get into a situation where they cannot afford to use the oil themselves and would profit more by sending their oil to other countries.""Mr Kramer's company exports most of the oil from the Tolobar mill it operates for the Marshall Islands government and its coconut oil fuel projects have recently taken a back seat.""At the peak we used 100 per cent coconut oil in ships with 1,000 horsepower engines and all the way down to five horsepower generators,"" he said.But he remains committed to the idea, especially using coconut oil to generate electricity in remote islands, where diesel is particularly expensive.Coconut oil was used as a substitute for diesel in the Philippines during World War II when diesel was scarce, but it is only in recent years the idea has taken off.The rising cost of oil, worries that oil will run out and increasing concerns about the environmental impact of fossil fuels have all boosted attempts to find alternative energy sources.In the Marshall Islands, Mr Kramer has been experimenting for several years with trying pure coconut oil in some of his vehicles, as well as heavy machinery and even tug boats and a cargo ship.Some modern diesel engines are less tolerant of pure coconut oil. Another problem is that coconut oil starts to solidify below 25 degrees Celsius - but that is not a problem on many tropical islands.Mr Kramer found carefully filtered coconut oil with excess moisture removed worked perfectly in many diesel engines.""With some of our trucks we run, we've been running on coconut oil for years and we haven't had a problem after four or five years,"" he said.But he says for many engines, a blend with diesel works best.""We did blends anywhere from 10 per cent to 90 per cent (with diesel) and we found the most tolerance for all types of engines was a 50-50 blend,"" Mr Kramer said.Australian-born entrepreneur Tony Deamer has also been experimenting in Vanuatu, running some vehicles from his own hire car and car dealership on pure coconut oil.He has also sold a blend of 80 per cent coconut oil and 20 per cent kerosene as a diesel alternative under the Island Fuel brand.Island Fuel has been on hold recently due to some equipment problems but Mr Deamer says it will be up and running again soon.Experiments with power generators have also been successful. In Vanuatu, electricity company UNELCO has been using diesel blended with coconut oil to run a large four megawatt generator.Mr Deamer says they are gradually increasing the proportion of coconut oil, which is 15 per cent now, to see how the generator performs.On Savaii island in Samoa, the electricity company has been running one generator on a coconut oil blend with success.Mr Deamer says substituting coconut oil for diesel will boost the declining copra industry.""My motivation is partly trying to keep some money going overseas here in the country instead, and keep some employment in rural areas,"" he said. ""I think it still has a future, I think we can make it happen.""Mr Cloin says the economics of using coconut oil for fuel are marginal, although the copra industry is already subsidised in many island countries, making diesel substitution more viable.""You have to understand that with normal economics, it doesn't really add up,"" he said. ""But if you agree electrification of remote islands is a good idea and subsidies are a good idea, then using coconut oil is a good idea.""-AFP","Alternative Energy, Business, Economics and Finance, Environment, Fiji, Industry, Marshall Islands, Oil and Gas, Vanuatu, ",2007-09-16 20:49:00+00:00
