Australia, New Zealand and the United States are concerned Chinese police could dislodge a long-standing security arrangement Canberra has with the Pacific Islands nation.However, the Solomon Islands said on Friday it had invited Australia to extend the police presence, originally due to end in December.Australia was the Pacific Islands nation's ""primary security partner"", a spokesperson for Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement. The Australian police will work alongside officers from Fiji, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.""At the request of the Solomon Islands government, Australia has extended its contribution to the Solomons International Assistance Force until June 2024 to assist with security for the national general elections,"" the statement said.The Australian police contingent arrived in December 2021 to quell anti-government riots, while Chinese police trainers arrived this year to prepare for the games.More than 5,000 athletes from two dozen nations are expected to attend the games, for which China has donated and constructed stadiums and other venues.China stepped up its funding for infrastructure after Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in 2019.The Solomon Islands last year signed a security pact with China, raising concern in Canberra and Washington about Beijing's naval ambitions.Reuters","China, Defence Forces, Defence Industry, Defence and National Security, Federal Government, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, Pacific, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2023-09-03T04:55:52+00:00

minister from a two-day summit aimed at improving Washington's ties to the region. Members of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) gathered for the second year in a row at the White House, where President Joe Biden urged leaders to ""recommit to each other"".""Because with the past as our proof, we're stronger and the world is safer when we stand together,"" he said.The US is working to boost its presence in the Pacific Islands, after publicly conceding it had not focused enough attention on the area while China's influence expanded.But in a blow to those diplomatic efforts, Solomon Islands' Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare declined to travel on to Washington after visiting New York City last week for the United Nations General Assembly.""I think it'd be fair to say that the United States is disappointed,"" a senior administration official told reporters on a background briefing.""We're disappointed that he has chosen not to come to this very special PIF Summit between the United States and the Pacific Island nations.""A Solomon Islands government official told the ABC that Mr Sogavare needed to attend to ""domestic issues"" in Honiara and that the invitation from the White House came after parliamentary business had been set.The secretary of Solomon Islands' foreign affairs ministry, Collin Beck, is attending the summit in Mr Sogavare's place.Vanuatu's prime minister Sato Kilman is also absent from the summit, however the US said he needed to be present for a no-confidence motion taking place in the country's parliament.The relationship between Solomon Islands and China has prompted concern in both Washington and Canberra, particularly after the two countries signed a secretive security pact last year.Mr Sogavare attended last year's summit in Washington but initially resisted signing a joint declaration being issued between the US and Pacific Island leaders.He has since visited China to meet President Xi Jinping, and last week told the UN General Assembly of his country's increasingly close ties to Beijing.""Solomon Islands is grateful and appreciates the ongoing support from our bilateral and multilateral partners, in particular the People's Republic of China, who has become our leading infrastructure partner,"" he told the meeting.Asked whether China had motivated increased engagement with the Pacific Islands, the Biden administration official appeared to agree that it had.""No question that its [China's] assertiveness and influence, including in this region, has been a factor that requires us to sustain our strategic focus,"" they said.""But what we're really focused on doing is showing our Pacific Island friends that the United States, working with like-minded partners, can provide viable alternatives that will work for Pacific Island nations.""In an example of Beijing's eagerness to expand its relations across the Pacific, a Chinese naval training ship docked in Papua New Guinea's capital today for a ""goodwill"" visit.Arriving in Port Moresby for the second time since 2019, training ship Qi Jiguang and its 300 naval personnel will spend the next few days in Papua New Guinea.Hundreds of people greeted the ship as it arrived in Port Moresby, waving both nations' flags.Rear Admiral Zhu Jianda said while in Port Moresby, senior officers would hold meetings with their PNG counterparts.""Those activities will enhance our mutual understanding, strengthen our mutual trust and deepen our friendship, which will be very helpful to build the maritime community of shared future for us,"" Rear Admiral Zhu said""China and the Papua New Guinea are good friends, good partners and good brothers.""I believe this visit will start a new chapter of friendly exchanges between us.""PNG Defence Minister Win Bakri Daki gave the visiting crew a warm welcome.""In military space, Papua New Guinea acknowledges that China's providing the military trainings to our defence officers,"" he said.He thanked China for bringing the ship to PNG ""and developing infrastructures, economic, you're helping so much, thank you so much"".Last year, China committed to funding the construction of a military hospital at Port Moresby's Taurama Barracks.China's ambassador to PNG, Zeng Fanhua, said he believed the two nations' ""political mutual trust has been consolidated"".The White House used the Pacific Islands summit to announce it had formally begun recognising Cook Islands and Niue as ""sovereign and independent"" states, meaning diplomatic relations will begin with both.""These milestones celebrate areas of change, and demonstrate that with unshakeable resolve and leadership, remarkable achievements are possible,"" said Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown.He also urged the United States to ""actively engage"" at the highest level, pointing to an upcoming forum meeting in Rarotonga, Cook Islands in November.""Engagement cannot be restricted to annual summits,"" Mr Brown said.""It must be year-long efforts, working to an agreed plan of action and supported by requisite resources to deliver transformative action on the ground.""The US is also promising nearly $US200 million ($311 million) for new projects and activities, including undersea cables to improve internet connectivity in the region.""Our objective is to build a better world, one of the great opportunities for security, prosperity and dignity for all our people, no matter where they live,"" Mr Biden told leaders.""That starts by building stronger partnerships with each other.""The Pacific Islands leaders stopped in Baltimore on their way to Washington, attending an American football game and visiting a Coast Guard facility.They are also expected to attend a roundtable focused on climate change, and meet Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen before wrapping up their visit.","China, Climate Change, Foreign Affairs, International Aid and Trade, Pacific, Solomon Islands, United States, World

2,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-08-02/china-buys-influence-solomon-islands-star-newspaper-pacific/102668914,"Concerns have been raised about foreign influence in Pacific media after it was revealed Solomon Islands' longest-running newspaper received funding from China in return for favourable coverage.Recently, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) has revealed how China has been attempting to gain influence in media outlets in Palau and Solomon Islands.In Palau, a failed media deal pushed by China has revealed how Beijing was seeking to exert its influence in the Pacific region by using political pressure and funding to capture local elites, including in the media.The OCCRP said at least one front page story had been supplied by an initiative that was backed by investors with ties to China's police and military.China had even more success gaining favour in Solomon Islands, where it has steadily been increasing its presence and influence since the Pacific nation switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 2019.There, according to the OCCRP,  the Solomon Star newspaper received Chinese money after giving assurances it would push messages favourable to Beijing.Desperate for funding, editors at the Solomon Star wrote up a proposal to China's embassy in Honiara, in July last year.The paper was struggling to keep up and needed assistance — its printing machines were deteriorating and papers were often hitting the streets a day late, according to the proposal the Solomon Star sent to China.Its radio station, Paoa FM, was having difficulty broadcasting into remote provinces.""Reporters obtained a July 2022 draft funding proposal from the Solomon Star to China's embassy in Honiara in which the paper requested 1,150,000 Solomon Islands dollars ($206,300) for equipment including a replacement for its ageing newspaper printer and a broadcast tower for its radio station, PAOA FM,"" OCCRP said.""The Solomon Star said in the proposal that decrepit equipment was causing editions to come out late and 'curtailing news flow about China's generous and lightning economic and infrastructure development in Solomon Islands'.""According to the proposal, seen by the ABC's Pacific Beat program, China stood to gain ""enormously"".""The intended outcome of this project … is that Solomon Star newspaper will be produced on time for the benefits of its readers, subscribers and the advertising community,"" it said.""China's timely intervention in Solomon Islands' infrastructure and economic development will also benefit enormously as news about this new-found partnership is published.""OCCRP has confirmed the printing equipment the Solomon Star wanted was delivered earlier this year.Alfred Sasako, Solomon Star's editor, said the newspaper maintained its independence.He told the OCCRP that any suggestion it had a pro-Beijing bias was ""a figment of the imagination of anyone who is trying to demonise China"".Sasako told the OCCRP the paper had tried unsuccessfully for more than a decade to get funding from Australia.Ofani Eremae, a journalist and co-founder at In-depth Solomons who used to work at the Solomon Star, said it has been struggling financially since COVID, and the majority of staff have left.""They are really in a very, very bad financial situation, so they are desperate,"" he told the ABC.""I think this is what's prompting them to look for finances elsewhere to keep the operation going.""It just so happens that China is here and they [Solomon Star] found someone who's willing to give them a lot of money.""Taking the assistance from China has raised questions about the paper's independence, he said.""It's a paper with the reputation people trust but in situations like that, you lose your credibility, you lose your independence and of course you become some kind of organisation that's been controlled by outsiders,"" Eremae told the ABC.Government spending on advertisements in the paper could help it somewhat, but Eremae said ""democratic countries, especially the US"" should step in and help.""They have to defend democracy, they have to defend freedom of the press in this country,"" he told the ABC.""Otherwise China, which seems to have a lot of money, they could just easily come in and take control of things here.""University of South Pacific journalism professor Shailendra Singh said ""the Chinese offer hit the right spot"", with the paper facing financial challenges due to COVID and advertising revenues going to social media.""If you look across the region, governments are shaking hands with China, making all kinds of deals and also receiving huge amounts of funds,"" he told the ABC.Professor Singh said media outlets have become part of the competition between large countries vying for influence in the region and warned other struggling Pacific media companies could be tempted by similar offers. ""They would seriously consider surrendering some of their editorial independence for a new printing press, just to keep them in business,"" he said.""Let's just hope that this does not become a trend.""The concerns these kind of deals bring was clear.""This is simply because of the risk of compromising editorial independence,"" Professor Singh told the ABC.""There is concern the country's major newspaper is turning into a Chinese state party propaganda rag.""If China managed to sway both the Solomon Islands government and its main newspaper, that would create an ""unholy alliance"", Professor Singh said.""The people would be at the mercy of a cabal, with very little — if not zero — public dissent,"" he said.Despite the concerns, Professor Singh said there were some sound reasons for Solomon Star to enter the deal.""If they don't sign the deal they will continue to struggle financially and it might even mean the end of the Solomon Star,"" he told the ABC.Only the Solomon Star publisher and editor had a full grasp of the situation and the financial challenges the paper faced, he said.""From our lofty perch we have all these grand ideas about media independence in theory, but does anyone consider the business realities?""""It may not make sense to the Americans or the Australians, but makes perfect sense to the Solomon Star from a business survival point of view.""Solomon Islands and Pacific outlets have been funded for media development by Australia and other governments.Third party organisations such as the ABC International Development supports the media community across the Pacific to promote public interest journalism and hold businesses, governments and other institutions to account.But Solomon Islands opposition MP Peter Kenilorea Junior said he was concerned by direct support given to the Solomon Star by a foreign government.""It's totally inappropriate for any government — let alone the Chinese government — to be involved in our newspaper publications, because that is supposed to be independent,"" he told the ABC.""I don't think standards are kept when there is this, according to the report, involvement by the Chinese to try and perhaps reward the paper for saying or passing on stories that are positive about a particular country.""Georgina Kekea, president of the Media Association of Solomon Islands, said the financial support did not come as a surprise as most businesses were struggling.""It's quite difficult for us to ensure that the media industry thrives when they are really floundering, where companies are finding it hard to pay their staff salary,"" she told the ABC.Following the OCCRP report, the Solomon Star on Tuesday ran a response on page six headlined ""Solomon Star condemns unrelated attack by US-funded OCCRP"".""It is sad to see the United States-funded OCCRP through its agent in Solomon Islands, Ofani Eremae, and his so-called 'In-depth Solomons' website making unrelented attempts to tarnish the reputation of the Solomon Star Newspaper for receiving funding support from China,"" the paper said.""One thing that Solomon Star can assure the right-minded people of this nation is that we will continue to inform and educate you on issues that matter without any geopolitical bias and that China through its Embassy in Honiara never attempted to stop us from doing so … Solomon Star also continued to publish news items not in the favour of China and the Chinese Embassy in Honiara never issued a reproachment.""It is indeed sad to see the OCCRP-funded journalists in Solomon Islands and the Pacific trying to bring geopolitics into the Pacific and Solomon Islands media landscape and Solomon Star strongly urges these journalists and their financiers to stop geo-politicising the media.""OCCRP said it ""is funded worldwide by a variety of government and non-government donors"".""OCCRP's work in the Pacific Islands is currently funded by a US-government grant that gives the donor zero say in editorial decisions,"" it said.Professor Singh said whether aid came from China, the US or Australia: ""There's no such thing as a free lunch.""The ABC has sought comment from the Solomon Star and the Chinese Embassy in Solomon Islands.","Asia, Broadcasting, China, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Information and Communication, Journalism, Law, Crime and Justice, Media Industry, Pacific, Print

So some of them are simply a GPS point on a map.""To resolve the scale of the threat will require multiple governments, many years and political will, he said.Removing oil from old wrecks is routine in some parts of the world, but it's not cheap.""This is something which we do not have resources for, nor the capacity and the technical know-how to carry out such an exercise,"" Solomon Islands Environment Minister Melchior Mataki told ABC's The Pacific program.Dr Mataki is calling on the war's main combatants to do more to alleviate the risk shipwrecks pose.""We were not responsible for having them in the first place,"" he said.""They [need] to work closely with us to render these wrecks safe, so that our people do not face this risk.""The Australian government has committed $2.12 million to help remove oil from potentially polluting wrecks in Chuuk Lagoon, under a project implemented by the Japanese Mine Action Service.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it also provided $4.3 million per year to the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, which has a project on waste management and pollution control, including activities targeting oil spill risk.The Japanese government said it had carried out projects to remove and recover leaked oil from shipwrecks in FSM alongside Japanese non-profit organisations for the past six years, contributing about $1 million each year.""These projects include exploration for sunken vessels, identification of their locations, investigation of possibilities of oil leakages, temporary measures to fix such leakages, and capacity building for local government officials.""In addition to greatly reducing the risk of oil leakage due to shipwreck decay and other causes, we also expect that these projects will contribute to the improvement of living conditions for local residents, environmental conservation, ecosystem protection, and the revitalisation of local industries such as fishing and tourism.""It added that the government would consider what other assistance it could provide to other nations in the Pacific based on the needs of each government.The ABC has contacted the US State Department for comment.Despite these initiatives, locals and experts say there's a lack of firm commitment from the war's combatants to decontaminate the shipwrecks at the scale required to protect the ocean from harm.Many who rely on the sea to survive, like Mr Chekani, fear help may come too late.The oil spill following the earthquake came as a shock to him and his community.""We didn't expect it to happen,"" he said.""I've never seen this before ... My concern is that it might happen again.""","Environmental Impact, Government and Politics, History, Maritime Accidents and Incidents, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Oceans and Reefs, Pacific, Solomon Islands, ",2023-09-09T19:09:59+00:00

And in the end the truth is what we want to know,"" he said.""There needs to be a broader inquiry into this rather than just the word of the Police Commissioner … to come up independently and verify for us whether yes or no.""Mr Kenilorea Jr said the allegation of weapons smuggling brought back memories of the violence and upheaval which bedevilled Solomon Islands in the lead-up to the RAMSI intervention in 2003, when militants took control of police armouries and seized semi-automatic weapons.""For us, allegations of real weapons coming in, these are issues which touch the heart of the security of our nation,"" he said.The controversy comes as Australia tries to cement its security ties with Solomon Islands, and ward off China's attempts to establish itself as a key security partner for the Pacific Island country in the wake of the contentious security pact it signed with Beijing last year.China has donated dozens of cars and motorcycles to the RSIPF, as well as two water cannon trucks, while last year Australia handed over more than 60 rifles, along with 13 new police vehicles.Australian police and military personnel led another security intervention into Solomon Islands in late 2021 after Honiara was hit with widespread looting and rioting and Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare called for assistance.Australian police remain in the country under the Solomon Islands Assistance Force and over the weekend the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) confirmed that more personnel would be sent over to help provide security for the Pacific Games in November.DFAT said that Australia had also agreed to extend the presence of the contingent until June next year, to help with elections due in 2024.Mr Sogavare has repeatedly assured Australia that it remains the security ""partner of choice"" for his country but has also warned he will call on China for help if he needs to do so.A spokesperson for DFAT stressed it made the security commitment at the request of the Solomon Islands government, and said Australia was ""proud to be Solomon Islands' primary security partner"".","Australia, China, Defence and National Security, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Pacific, Security Intelligence, Solomon Islands, United States, World Politics, ",2023-09-04T04:56:17+00:00

She was a month into the job; a young cadet reporter at Solomon Islands' national broadcaster, SIBC.Then, the coup happened.  ""I had family on both sides,"" Ms Kekea said.  ""My parent's house got burnt. Two of my cousins were shot. There were lots of people carrying weapons out there and you just never knew when something was going to happen.""At work, if they [the armed militants] didn't like the way a story was presented they would storm into the SIBC studios yelling 'where is she?' or 'where is he?', looking for the newsreader — they just knew us as the voice, the person reading the news. ""Our lives were at risk.""   It was a scary time for Solomon Islands. After years of bubbling ethnic tensions in the late 1990s, the 2000 coup, which ousted Solomon Islands then prime minister, would trigger three more years of violence and civil unrest referred to by locals as 'the tensions'.  It centred on fighting over land and ethnic disputes between militants from Guadalcanal, where the capital Honiara sits, and the nearby island of Malaita, the country's most populous island. About 200 people are thought to have died during the conflict, thousands were displaced and sexual assaults and violence were rife. Then, on July 24 2003, after a request from the Solomon Islands government, the Australia-led Regional Assistance to Mission Solomon Islands — later known as RAMSI — arrived. ""I remember this feeling of utter relief at the time,"" Ms Kekea, now the head of Solomon Islands media association and a veteran journalist of the region, said.  ""When RAMSI came we felt safe.""Today marks 20 years since Australian boots first stepped on the tarmac at Honiara's International Airport. At the time, then prime minister John Howard said he expected the presence to be there for ""months"". It lasted 14 years.   More than 7,200 soldiers and 1,700 Australian Federal Police officers were a part of the effort, which cost Australia an estimated $2.8 billion and took the lives of two Australians. But, critically, it brought relative peace.""RAMSI restored hope,"" James Batley, the second special coordinator of RAMSI and a former high commissioner to Solomon Islands, told the ABC. ""It stopped a violent conflict in its tracks [and] it appears to stopped an emerging culture of militant and gun culture.""Australian soldiers and federal police quickly restored law and order and confiscated thousands of guns.Today it is still illegal for Solomon Islands residents to own firearms, and the police force was only rearmed in 2017, when RAMSI left.But, fast-forward to today, Mr Batley is concerned about what lessons have been learnt in the country — and where things seem to be headed.  ""Post conflict states are never really 'post-conflict', there's always the seed of further disruption,"" he said.  ""And I think we are in danger of more civil unrest there. There is a lack of accountability in Solomon Islands. It's very easy for grievances to build up, without effective pressure valves to release it.""And there are profound development challenges in the country, and major issues about how power is distributed.""       A number of commemorative events set to be held this week in Honiara, with Minister for International Development and the Pacific Pat Conroy representing Australia. But the celebrations come at a time when Solomon Islands' future prosperity and security is at a crossroads. After switching diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China in 2019, its leader Manasseh Sogavare has created continued nervousness in Canberra and Washington with his lean towards Beijing and the signing of last year's secretive security pact. Australian troops returned to the capital after rioters torched part of the city Chinatown in November 2021. A small force remains, with Australia indicating it could stay for longer than intended.  Just last week, Mr Sogavare made headlines during his second trip to China, signing a new security and police pact with China, which Australia suggested he ""immediately"" make public.  Mr Sogavare accused Australia of meddling in the sovereign domestic issues of the country. Then he accused Australia and New Zealand of pulling budget support — a claim both countries have denied — revealing China had ""stepped up"" to fill the void.   At one point last week he even suggested Solomon Islands might set up its own military force — a move Australia's Deputy Prime Minster Richard Marles said he would be ""very keen"" to help with.  Many Pacific watchers accuse Mr Sogavare of leveraging the two superpowers — and Australia — against each other to create a political wedge, enabling him to receive more aid from all sides and, critically for him, cling on to power.  But others say he is a deft political operator, and are critical of the role Australia is playing in geopolitical tug-of-war in Solomon Islands and the Pacific more generally.  Tarcisius Kabutaulaka, a Solomon Islander and director of the Centre for Pacific Islands Studies at the University of Hawaii, said he believed the geopolitical competition had undermined efforts to bring peace to Solomon Islands.""What we've seen in the case of Solomon Islands, I think, is an increasing militarisation of the Solomon Islands police force, not only by China, but by Australia as well,"" he said.""It comes in terms of supplying the kinds of weapons that they would otherwise not have supplied, had there not been China.""He said development partners could learn from RAMSI's values in today's climate. ""One of the things RAMSI did and for which a lot of Solomon islanders were very happy and continue to be really appreciative of was collecting weapons and destroying them,"" he said. ""And that was a big thing. It's sad that not long after RAMSI's withdrawal, Australia is arming the same institution that initially also was involved in supplying arms that ended up in communities.""Gordon Darcy Lilo, who served as prime minister of the Solomon Islands from 2011 to 2014, agreed.He said the kind of great power battle for security that was playing out in Solomon Islands was unhelpful for the country.""We have those basic [elements] established during the RAMSI time, and we should maintain them and then move forward,"" he said. ""Because, this is a security situation that is built along [with] the conviction and the participation of the people.""He said he hoped today's anniversary would be an opportunity for Solomon Islands and its partners to reflect on RAMSI's values.Today, Gina Kekea heads the Media Association Solomon Islands and is also a mother of seven. As one of the region's leading journalists, she's met many Solomon Islanders living across its nine provinces and knows the many challenges the country's population faces. Although she is optimistic about Solomon Islands' future, she hopes lessons have been learnt from the past. ""We have many development challenges in Solomon Islands — in the provinces, there's no access to transport, bad roads, no basic sanitation or medical supplies,"" she said. ""My kids ask me what it was like back then, the ethnic tension. I try to explain … but a lot of people still don't like talking about it.  ""And we cannot dwell on the past, but we have to learn from it, so it will never happen again."" ","Armed Conflict, Army, Government and Politics, International Law, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Unrest, Conflict and War, ",2023-07-23T20:00:13+00:00

One, Benjamin Buga, who had been in and out of the hospital for a year, said there were ""not enough"" doctors and nurses. But he said he supported the event as he believed it would generate income for the country. While another, Lilian Iwa, said a lot of money had been allocated to the Games.But at her local clinic, in a regional province of Solomon Islands, they did not have basic drugs like paracetamol.   Opposition MP Peter Kenilorea Jr was worried the government had lost a sense of perspective. ""Solomon Islands, we love sports, that's very true,"" he said. ""But when you compare that to a hospital, to a clinic, which are critical infrastructure, to bridges, even roads, a stadium is really a vanity project."" Christian Nieng, the director of the Pacific Games National Hosting Authority, doesn't see it that way. Instead Mr Nieng describes it as a ""big thing"" that will ""unite"" the nation. He said Solomon Islands was now only the fifth nation to host the Pacific Games and it had given the nation a goal to focus on and helped develop local skills. ""The Games has actually raised the standard of doing things, especially organising big events,"" he said. ""It has given the country the opportunity to make improvements in areas that we wouldn't otherwise haven't seen improvements on.""For instance, in infrastructure, and also the level of training that our staff are getting in terms of organising similar events.""He said despite construction continuing on many facilities — and concerns over the impact of sporadic electricity supply in Honiara — the facilities would be ready.  ""I am confident that the bits and pieces that we need to put together especially against critical activities are on track, and we will be ready to welcome our neighbours,"" he said.""We are ready.""Back at the poultry farm, Ms Molea-Chow said she had conflicting feelings about the Games. One part of her resented how much money was being put into sporting facilities when ""health and education"" were suffering. The other part was pure excitement — and a hope that it could be the start of bigger things for her business and her country.  ""As a Solomon Islander, I'm very proud to be for us to be hosting this,"" she said. ""I'm just happy to see other people from other countries come and enjoy the hospitality that we have to offer.""The Pacific program airs on the international ABC Australia service on Thursdays at 7pm, in Australia on the ABC News Channel on Thursdays at 9:30pm and on Fridays at 10:30am on ABC TV.

We adopt a non-aligned policy,"" he said.""We now live in a very dynamic, geopolitical landscape … where each country must be able to decide how they deal with that for the best interest of their countries.""The new prime minister's majority remains narrow, and some MPs in Vanuatu are predicting that the new government could well face its own no-confidence motion before too long.Mr Kilman's last term in office was also plagued by corruption, with 14 sitting members of parliament — including the deputy prime minister and speaker — sentenced to prison on corruption and bribery charges.But the new prime minister told the ABC he wanted to push ahead with his proposal for a new integrity bill which he said would reduce corruption and help stabilise politics in Vanuatu, in part by subsidising political parties in the country.""One of the priorities for me … would be to try and speak to all political leaders [on the bill],"" he said.""If I can do that, and we can come to some agreements on issues in that bill, and if we can get it passed in parliament, that would be a big step forward to maintaining and having a stable government in Vanuatu.""Dr Newton Cain said that similar reforms had been discussed for a long time in Vanuatu, but ""so far there has yet to be sufficient consensus to get measures such as these across the line"". ""Passing a law is one thing — without appropriate architecture, resources and commitment to apply and prosecute the law it is likely to be meaningless,"" she said.""Also if the various checks and balances are applied to political parties then what we will likely see (as we did in Solomon Islands) is an increase in people standing as independents to avoid the scrutiny — of course this would also mean they would miss out on the benefit of receiving funding.""During a previous tenure as prime minister in 2012, Mr Kilman expelled 12 Australian Federal Police officers from Vanuatu after he was stopped while transiting through an Australian airport and his adviser was arrested by Australian police on tax fraud charges. ","Australia, China, Defence and National Security, Federal Government, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2023-09-05T02:58:14+00:00
10,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-07-22/china-us-powerplay-in-the-pacific-intensifies/102633474,"In 2012, Hilary Clinton smiled at Pacific leaders gathered in Rarotonga's cavernous National Auditorium and delivered a rehearsed and soothing line.The US Secretary of State told the assembly all nations, including the United States and China, had an ""important stake"" in the region's prosperity and security.She stressed the importance of Beijing being ""transparent"" in the Pacific, but her overall message was about boosting cooperation to help island nations prosper.""I think, after all, the Pacific is big enough for all of us,"" she told leaders with a smile.More than a decade later, that well-meaning bromide looks optimistic.Washington and Beijing are engaged in an increasingly fierce arm wrestle for diplomatic and technological supremacy, and the risk is growing that the Pacific becomes a vector for that contest.The very fact secretary Clinton was in the Cook Islands at all in 2012 — attending as a dialogue partner for the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting — was an early sign that the United States was intent on reasserting its influence in the region after decades of near neglect.But if the Obama administration's Pacific tilt was largely talk, President Joe Biden's has been intent on action.Last year, the administration hosted a landmark presidential summit with Pacific leaders at the White House, and US officials say they are planning a repeat this September.The United States is now reopening embassies throughout the Pacific, expanding its aid program, ramping up US Coastguard operations in the region, and unveiling a host of initiatives — sometimes with partners — which it says will help the region tackle its mounting list of threats, from climate change to illegal fishing.The US also promised to triple funding for the South Pacific Tuna Treaty, which could funnel some $US600 million ($850 million) to Pacific nations over the next decade — although so far the money remains locked up in lengthy budget negotiations in a deeply polarised Congress.The diplomatic flurry shows no sign of slowing.This week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will land in Tonga to formally open a new diplomatic mission in the capital.His counterpart, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, will land in Port Moresby around the same time, to discuss the implementation of a wide-ranging and contentious Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCI) that the US and Papua New Guinea signed in May.It's not just about strategic denial. But there's no doubt that Washington has been moving with more urgency and purpose in the wake of China striking a security pact with Solomon Islands last year — a move which sent shock waves through both Washington and Canberra.Since then, China has rapidly stepped up police cooperation with Solomon Islands, much to the unease of the West.And while Chinese development assistance to the region has fallen away, Beijing has intensified efforts to court Pacific political elites, while Chinese companies with deep networks in the region continue to win major infrastructure projects bankrolled by multinational organisations like the Asian Development Bank.Meanwhile, Chinese diplomats in the region are also making increasingly confident claims about being an exemplar and model for Pacific development, despite Pacific leaders making it crystal clear last year that they were not ready to sign a sweeping trade and security pact with Beijing.In May this year, China's Ambassador to Solomon Islands told the Global Times that Pacific island nations had struggled with ""development stagnation"" because they had adopted ""Westernised"" political models in the wake of colonisation.""The great practice of Chinese modernisation abandons the old Western modernisation path and provides a new modernisation reference model for PICs, providing a Chinese solution to achieve long-term stability and eradicate extreme poverty,"" he said.As Australian academic Graeme Smith observed this week, both state-owned and private Chinese companies are now increasingly being forced to ""carry geopolitical water"" and prosecute Beijing's interests — like when the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) lobbied Solomon Islands to abandon diplomatic ties with Taiwan.""China is now a serious player in the region with a development philosophy to sell,"" he wrote in the Conversation.""It's no longer enough to read Beijing's talking points. You have to look like you mean it.""It's not only the United States and China, of course.A quick glance at the list of visitors to Papua New Guinea in just the last three months gives you a clear sense of just how many players are now intent on building up their political stocks in the blue Pacific — which keeps the red-carpet runners at Port Moresby's APEC terminal increasingly busy.UK Foreign Affairs Secretary James Cleverly travelled to Papua New Guinea in April to sign a renewed Status of Forces Agreement in Port Moresby.Less than one month later, PNG also hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Antony Blinken, along with NZ Prime Minister Chris Hipkins and almost a dozen Pacific Island leaders.The country backed it up again earlier this month with Indonesian President Joko Widodo.And by the end of next week, both Lloyd Austin and French President Emmanuel Macron can be added to that long catalogue.Macron's main focus will be spending time in the French territory of New Caledonia, which is grappling with complex and fraught political issues around independence and the status of its ties with Paris.But Macron will then travel on to Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu — the first time a French president has left home soil while in the region — to promote what his office has called a ""French alternative"" to the brewing contest between Washington and Beijing.Meanwhile, Mr Austin will be firmly focused on defence ties and shoring up the defence cooperation — which might still face a tricky path through PNG's parliament and legal system.PNG Prime Minister James Marape has faced hurdles in selling the agreement at home, and PNG's opposition leader is seeking legal advice for a possible Supreme Court challenge.The Lowy Institute's Mihai Sora said the DCA ""came at some expense to Prime Minister Marape domestically"".""Secretary Austin will be looking to reinforce the US's interest in contributing to PNG's security needs and to increase local support for the DCA so that it passes through the Papua New Guinean system,"" he said.The deal might also come at some expense to Canberra, even though it has been officially welcomed by the federal government.Mr Marape's struggle to sell the US defence agreement is also contributing to delays with Australia's proposed Bilateral Security Treaty with PNG, which was already meant to be finalised and signed.In that way, the DCA also serves as a neat reminder that while Canberra is very glad to see Washington re-engaged in the Pacific, the two nations do not always have identical interests.If it's approved, the agreement will firm up a possible military foothold for the United States at key bases in Papua New Guinea — although the Pentagon and Mr Marape have been at pains to stress that it does not specifically authorise a permanent US presence in the country.""It's important to remember that the [DCA] will respect PNG sovereign decisions,"" a Pentagon spokesperson said this week.""All activities must be mutually agreed upon.""But the deal will inevitably still feed into existing anxieties throughout the Pacific that strategic competition between the West and China — as well as other players — risks driving a rapid militarisation of the region.And perhaps nowhere is that anxiety more acute than in Papua New Guinea's neighbour, Solomon Islands.Manasseh Sogavare was in a pugnacious mood on Monday when he landed back in Honiara from a week-long trip to China.The Solomon Islands prime minister once again berated Australia and the US for questioning his country's growing police cooperation with China, including a police ""implementation plan"" he signed while in Beijing.He also angered Australian officials by accusing both Australia and New Zealand of mysteriously ""delaying"" direct budget support and putting the Solomon Islands budget in a precarious position — an allegation both Canberra and Wellington have denied outright.The stoush created plenty of headlines, but a throwaway comment by the prime minister near the end of the press conference might prove to have much more consequence over the long term.Mr Sogavare gave the clearest public indication yet that he wants to push ahead with developing an armed forces, declaring that the 1,500-strong Royal Solomon Islands Police Force was simply too small to guarantee either internal or external security for the country.He also revealed he had ""sounded out"" Australia's Deputy Prime Minister, Richard Marles, about the idea during Mr Marles' visit to Honiara a few weeks ago.The timing was probably no accident. Mr Sogavare has mused in the past about getting China to help him set up a military, and Australia will be desperate to ensure that does not happen.When he was asked about Mr Sogavare's comments a few days later, Mr Marles declared that Australia would be ""very keen"" to help Solomon Islands if it decided to press ahead with the plan.That's likely to take Australia into a very fraught space.Any move to set up a standing Solomon Islands army would likely prove deeply contentious in the Pacific Island which has been repeatedly roiled by ethnic strife and violence, and which already lacks the money to properly fund health and education services.Some civil society groups and Pacific officials have already expressed deep concern about the idea in private.It's likely to split opinion in the Canberra bureaucracy as well.Anna Powles from Massey University said Mr Marles was probably intent on both denying China a role in any military set-up in Solomon Islands and ""managing alliance expectations with the US"".""Recent talk of standing up militaries in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu has been doing the rounds for months and has intensified over the past year with US and Chinese security assistance on offer in the region,"" she wrote on Twitter.""Canberra will need to tread very carefully.""But the episode also shows how Mr Sogavare — for all his bluster and braggadocio — has proven very adept at leveraging Australia's anxiety about China to get what he wants.Whether that chimes with what people in Solomon Islands want and need is a separate question.And the risk is that as the geopolitical contest intensifies, that distinction blurs or disappears entirely.And even Pacific leaders who are also skilfully navigating the same shoals with nothing but the interests of their people in mind face growing risks as global tensions rise.""The Pacific is well and truly in the mix as the US and China vie for global strategic primacy,"" the Lowy Insitute's Mihai Sora said.""The US is alliance-building across the Indo-Pacific and openly calls for support to uphold the global rules-based order.""China downplays its strategic intent; it does not telegraph its moves, but it is pursuing the largest military build-up in history and opportunistically looking to expand its strategic reach, including into the Pacific.""With opportunity comes risk, and plenty of snares and pitfalls which are not easily dodged.And as the competition ramps up, with ever more outside players clamouring for a spot in the vast Pacific, the margin for error grows more narrow.","Australia, Defence and National Security, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, United States, World Politics, ",2023-07-21T20:58:56+00:00

You think about your family everyday, you miss them.""    The song is one of Fiji's biggest hits this year.""It was hard to write, I had my own experience working there.""It's slang, Ilavo ni Aussie Ilavo Mosimosi, it's what Fijians say when they're out there working on the farms.  ""It's big money, out there, but it's tough work."" The PALM scheme concept itself dates back to 2007, then known as the Seasonal Worker Program. When COVID hit, Australia's once-reliable source of seasonal labour, backpackers, evaporated and the agricultural sector turned to the Pacific.Thousands of Pacific Islanders streamed into the country, and the program has been expanding rapidly, with workers now able to work in Australia for nine months to four years.  ""I think it's the ultimate win-win,"" Minister for the Pacific Pat Conroy told the ABC.   ""Australia benefits by having our labour shortages filled by some of our closest neighbours, the workers win by picking up much needed skills and [on average] send home $15,000 per year."" Whilst the vast majority of employers and workers say the scheme is mutually beneficial, it has been dogged with persistent stories of exploitation around the accommodation provided, the work itself and services provided by employees.Pacific Islanders themselves have often struggled with the adaption required to work in Australia, while absconding has long been an issue.  And with its rapid expansion, it is causing major social issues in Pacific countries, with the ABC hearing dozens of stories of broken marriages and strained relationships because of the scheme.  In Fiji, there's even slang associated with extramarital affairs, with the word ""lasa tuba"" abbreviated to ""Aussie LT"" meaning the ""other partner"" in Australia.  In the Pacific the exodus to Australia is causing major headaches.  Pacific leaders raise it regularly, with Samoa's prime minister recently stating it was rivalling climate change as the ""number one"" issue the country faced. She said countries like hers should not been seen merely as ""outposts"" which ""grow"" labourers for developed nations. As of July 31, 38,259 Pacific Islanders were working in Australia through the scheme, down from a record of almost 40,000 in June. At the start of the year the figure was around 20,000.The Australian government wants the scheme to grow and has pushed back on criticisms that it is causing brain drain, saying Pacific leaders had the power to control or cap how many workers they allowed overseas. In a country like Tonga, the workers make up a staggering 6 per cent of the total population of the country.According to business owners in Tonga it is creating gaping holes in the workforce.""My turnover is too numerous to count,"" Tanoa Hotel Tonga manager Jason Strickland told the ABC. ""It's not equated to poor management, it's equated to people leaving overseas in big groups and I'm sure other businesses are experiencing this.""Essentially I feel like I'm running a hotel school.""     Mr Strickland said he had ""no issue"" with people moving to chase better opportunities.     He said the problem was highly-qualified staff moving overseas because the money was better, meaning, ironically, he's had to turn to other countries to fill the void.  ""I don't think the answer is for businesses to stamp their feet and ask these schemes to stop, I think they're here to stay,"" he said. ""But If you are going to take my chefs or my receptionists or my front office staff overseas and give them opportunities, I think they would be better suited in hotels and restaurants, rather than meat packing and agriculture.""The issue has extended to Tonga's major hospital. Nurse manager Meleinu Felise said as well as moving overseas to work in the aged-care sector, some nurses were opting to work in Australia picking fruit.   ""As we all know, nurses are moving around because of better pay 'on the other side',"" she said. ""They're looking for a better life.""But they say they want to come back, and they will come back, because their families are here. As we all know, in Tonga, we have obligations.  ""I hate to say it [but] if worse comes to worse, we'll get overseas workers, Pacific Islanders, to come and do a month here.""Back in Fiji, Nai Misipeka and her five children have learnt to adapt without their husband and father. The children do more in the garden and Nai brings in help from the community where she can.    The money John has made through the scheme has enabled them to lay-buy a new washing machine — the rest has gone on food. But, with another three years of work ahead, they have plans to build an extension on their home.""The money is good, but the important thing to us is our children,"" she said.""I want us, my family, to go to Australia [for the duration of his work] and support my husband. As soon as he's finished, we come back."" The Australian government has recognised this, introducing a ""trial"" of 200 long-term PALM scheme workers being able to bring their families to Australia.  Mr Conroy said he recognised for some families the separation was ""tough"".""[The trial] is aimed at dealing with that dislocation impact being reported to us,"" Mr Conroy said. ""And we have to work with communities to make sure it's in their interests to participate.   ""But overwhelmingly [this] has been positive for the Pacific, this is helping people out of poverty, and that's why it's so important.""With her husband still months away from a short trip home for Christmas, Nai has a message for him.  ""John, we will always love you.

Law and order issues could be better addressed by investment in youth, development and economic opportunity.""And, finally, the greatest security threat — climate change — requires strengthened disaster preparedness and response.""Tess Newton Cain from the Griffith Asia Institute's Pacific Hub said both governments could face deep opposition in Solomon Islands and the wider Pacific region if they pushed ahead with the plan.""The question is whether the people of Solomon Islands think this is a good idea,"" Dr Newton Cain said.""There are huge human security and development challenges in Solomon Islands.

He welcomed the commitment of election funding.Mr Sogavare's tone shifted away from the rising tensions of last year, when he said Australia was too slow to respond to civil unrest in the Solomon Islands, failed to protect Chinese government projects, and attempted to use funding to influence the country's elections. Australian government sources told the ABC they did not believe Mr Sogavare was going to use the review to weaken the security relations between the two countries. Meanwhile mounting geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States has brought the two powers to loggerheads in the region.Their jockeying for influence has been a boon to Pacific governments, with aid, loans and construction project windfalls flowing into their coffers to the tune of tens of millions of dollars.Instead of taking sides between Washington and Beijing, most are welcoming all comers and the new diplomatic and economic capital they bring.""It is not in the interest of our people and country to take sides and align ourselves with interests that are not our interests,"" Mr Sogavare said at an independence anniversary event on Saturday.In the face of its rivalry with China, Washington in February reopened its mission in the Solomon Islands after a 30-year hiatus.China has also won influence, striking a secretive security deal with the Solomons that allows Beijing's forces to deploy on the islands.Mr Sogavare's visit will likely fuel concerns Solomon Islands is drifting closer into China's orbit.AFP/ABC","Asia, China, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Taiwan, World Politics, ",2023-07-10T10:30:16+00:00

So we think taking this opportunity to update the security treaty to comprehend our current assistance is a really exciting opportunity to revitalise the security agreement between our two countries.""Mr Sogavare also welcomed Mr Marles's commitment of election funding. It was in stark contrast to last year when he accused Australia of trying to use election funding offers to influence the timing of Solomon Islands elections.","Australia, China, Defence and National Security, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, National Security, Pacific, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2023-06-29T04:33:46+00:00

She is really inspiring, and her background is also Indian, which makes her more inspiring to me,"" Clea, 11, whose mother is Indian, said.Sian, 13, who also has an Australian Indian background, agreed.""At first I didn't really see many people who were from my culture playing.

I didn't really want to move forward because I was kind of scared that was going to happen again,"" Sian said.""But definitely seeing Sam have a lot of injuries and just coming back better than ever, and really wanting to play, has made me not fear that anymore.""Also, my teammates and the love of this club has really made me want to come back to playing soccer and not quit, just keep going.""Aish Ravi, founder and director of the Women's Coaching Association, said seeing players of colour compete at such a high level helped to dismantle stereotypes about who was seen as a typical footballer and could help ""rewrite the possibilities"".""Seeing somebody of Indian heritage, of colour, playing on the world stage – one of the best players on the planet – it's incredible, it's inspiring, it shows that anything's possible,"" she said of Kerr.""She's my idol. She's really the first player that I've ever seen that really looks like me playing at an elite level.""Ms Ravi said growing up, there were cultural barriers that prevented her from participating in mainstream sport, including a culture of prioritising academic achievement over sport, in pursuit of economic and career stability.""Instead of spending my Saturday mornings playing on a football pitch, I spent them often in tutoring centres trying to master maths and English,"" she said.""I wasn't really encouraged to go out and play in the sun, I guess because your skin would get darker.""But there are hopes for a cultural shift. Sian's mother, Nicole Camilleri, is heavily involved in the Keilor Park Soccer Club.She said apart from the health and physical benefits, it was important for girls to engage in the social aspect sport offered — making friends, bonding as a team and having fun.Beyond Kerr, soccer fanatics from diverse backgrounds have found inspiration in Matildas players including Mary Fowler, whose mother was born in Papua New Guinea, and Indigenous players like Anaiwan woman Kyah Simon and Noongar goalkeeper Lydia Williams.Some have also seen themselves reflected in players from other nations, such as Morocco's Nouhaila Benzina, who made history when she became the first player to wear a hijab at the World Cup level.But barriers and racism persist, and Indigenous athletes have criticised the ""empty symbolism"" of the World Cup, citing a lack of legacy funding for First Nations football — a claim Football Australia has contested.Ms Ravi, who is also completing a PhD at Monash University on the lived experience of women football coaches, said more needed to be done to give female players job prospects in coaching or media after their retirement from professional football, and to combat homophobia and racism.The latter is something she has experienced personally.""I was racially vilified while playing football last year … it's never the same after you've encountered something like that,"" she said.""Stepping out on the field has a different meaning … those memories stay with you and they haunt you.""Sports organisations need to understand it's not something that they can just sweep under the rug and forget, because if people do have negative experiences within their sports, they're just not going to play.""Players across the Pacific have been inspired by Mary Fowler, whose mother comes from the village of Kira Kira in Papua New Guinea.In an Instagram post, Fowler said the support from the village touched her heart and made her ""so proud to be Papuan"". Her uncle, Rabura Geita, told the ABC's Pacific Beat program that there usually was not much interest in soccer in the village, where rugby league and volleyball are more popular.""But because of my niece Mary Fowler, the whole village is involved in participating and watching the games,"" he said, adding people with flat-screen TVs would bring them out onto the street so the whole village could support her.""In the village, young boys and girls, especially the small ones, they force their parents to buy soccer balls,"" he said.He said the atmosphere was electric when the 20-year-old scored or set up crucial goals, with shouts of happiness and frivolity around the village.""We believe in Mary and we are all praying for her,"" he said.Ileen Pegi, the captain of the Solomon Islands women's football team, was in Australia to watch the England vs Denmark match.""I can't explain [how it felt]. I'm so happy and really inspired … to be able to be part of this worldwide game,"" she said.She said she idolised Kerr and England's Lauren James, who is of Grenadian and Dominican descent on her father's side, for their discipline and focus.She said having Australia and New Zealand hosting the World Cup, as well as seeing players with links to the Pacific like Fowler, had stoked interest from locals and motivated the country's younger generation.""It's really excited to see more girls interested in playing football,"" she said.""Everyone just goes crazy and then follows women's football, so it's a big change for us in the Solomons.""She said the experience had stoked her own dream of playing in the World Cup one day.""It's not easy, the challenge is always there, but you have to keep going and follow your dreams for the new generation to come.""It's not just girls and boys getting swept up in football fever — their mothers are finding inspiration, too.Mai Tran, 44, originally from Vietnam, had never played soccer until 14 months ago.""I didn't know how to kick the ball,"" she said.But her 16-year-old daughter encouraged her to give it a try.""I was really shy and did not have enough courage to join, but my daughter said to me, 'You can do it, try it! You never know,'"" Ms Tran said.""So finally I have courage enough to get involved, to start to train with soccer mums, and oh my goodness, I couldn't believe myself. I just love it.""She said playing with the Keilor Park Go Soccer Mums team had helped improve her health, make friends, and even practise her English.Tay Tay Pai, 19, a Karenni and Burmese woman who came to Australia as a refugee from Thailand when she was six, plays for the Settlement Services International Women's All Stars in Logan, south of Brisbane.Her team includes players with Chinese, Karen, Karenni and Matu backgrounds.""We love soccer because it teaches us ways of respect and being humble on and off the field,"" she said.""Team sport really transcends cultural and language barriers. It brings us all together to work together and play the sport they love.""But it's still sad to see and hear that some countries are still left behind in women's sport because they cannot afford to fund a team to play in the Women's World Cup.  She said she was proud of helping her teammates build confidence through sport, but she said it was important to get more opportunities to play soccer in her suburb or surrounds, and for it to be more affordable.Asma Mirzae, who came to Australia as an Afghan refugee when she was 11, is the co-founder of Melbourne United, a women's-only football team for newly arrived refugee and migrant girls, many of whom come from Afghanistan and identify as Muslim.Other than rallying behind the Matildas, she said another defining moment of the World Cup for the Melbourne United girls was watching Morocco's Nouhaila Benzina — especially during the match against the team from France, where women are banned from wearing the hijab during play.""We've seen the very first hijabi girl on one of the world's greatest stages, and I'm now seeing post after post on the socials … [saying] how they feel seen on such a big level,"" she said.""Role models like that definitely play a key role around inspiring and empowering girls to participate in football.""She said seeing other culturally diverse players was motivational for girls on her team.""A lot of the time we hear that … if you come from the Muslim faith, sport is not a priority for you,"" she said, adding it was a stereotype often perpetuated by the broader community and the media.""We are challenging that narrative around what it means to be a Muslim woman and also be playing sport.""But she added more needed to be done to create safe spaces, prevent racism and remove systemic barriers.Many players she knows often spent hours trying to find leggings that matched their sporting team's colours.""This sport is for all. And it doesn't matter where you come from, or how you look, what colour skin you've got, or what religion you're practising. I think that's what we really need to work on.""","Australia, Community and Society, FIFA World Cup, France, India, Islam, Keilor Park, Logan Central, Melbourne, Morocco, Myanmar, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Race Relations, Soccer, Solomon Islands, Vietnam, Women, Women Religious, ",2023-08-14T19:10:35+00:00

But I am glad to announce and delighted to announce the People's Republic of China have really stepped up to provide this budget support needed for 2023.""Mr Sogavare said China would provide the support through ""projects"" but did not provide any further details.In a statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) denied the Australian government had backtracked on any formal commitments.""Australia has delivered on our budget support commitments to Solomon Islands this year,"" a DFAT spokesperson said.""This support has been provided across numerous sectors in Solomon Islands including health, education and elections,"" they said.""We continue to discuss development and budget support needs with the Solomon Islands government.""Australia has announced several tranches of direct support in the past two years, including $25 million for running elections in 2024, and almost $17 million for the Pacific Games.Lowy Institute Pacific Islands Program director Meg Keen she was surprised to hear Mr Sogavare's accusations, as there was ""no record"" of the withdrawal in budget support.  However, Dr Keen said that behind closed doors the Australian government would ""no doubt be concerned"" about Mr Sogavare's comments and perceived lean towards China.     ""It's another example of Mr Sogavare trying to wedge Australia, the US and China to get more for his country,"" Dr Keen said.  ""There has been long-held concern [from Australia] about Mr Sogavare getting closer to China, and you can see from these comments that perhaps that concern is justified.""   Mr Sogavare also berated Australia and the United States for raising concerns about deepening police cooperation between China and Solomon Islands.""The narrow and coercive diplomatic approach of targeting China-Solomon Islands relations, and I want to use this word, is unneighbourly … this is nothing but interference of foreign states in the internal affairs of Solomon Islands,"" he said.""China has not invaded or colonised any other nation-state. Australia and the United States should not fear China's police support.""Australia is increasingly anxious that China might send police to the Pacific Island country if the country is once again hit by disorder like the rioting which shook Honiara in late 2021.Mr Sogavare stressed that Australia, New Zealand and other Pacific nations remained the security ""partner of choice"" for Solomon Islands, and he said if riots broke out once again then he would call them first for help.""We have a standing, a current arrangement with SIAF (Solomon Islands Assistance Forces) with Australia, New Zealand, PNG, Fiji, but now we'll need to dialogue with them, as we are consistent that they are our partner of choice,"" he said.""For that matter we'll need to call on them first. The police commissioner is working very closely with these countries and from the police commissioner's briefing, the arrangements are set.""But he also stressed that Solomon Islands had a ""standing arrangement"" with China as well, and if there was a ""delay"" getting help then ""it takes only nine hours' flight from China to land forces here"".""Nothing is actually stopping me from that if there are some hiccups along the way,"" he said.""We can invoke our security arrangements. Nothing will stop this sovereign country.""The prime minister said China was also providing invaluable support in a host of other development areas, including infrastructure, health, agriculture, sport and tackling climate change.Mr Sogavare said China might ""very well be the answer to — not all — but most of our challenges"", and Solomon Islands had to free itself from the ""yoke"" of dependency on others.He also mused about Solomon Islands setting up its own armed forces, saying its police force was far too small to deal with a rapidly growing population.But that would be a significant departure for Solomon Islands, which has long been troubled by domestic turmoil but does not maintain a standing army.Mr Sogavare said he ""sounded out"" the issue with Mr Marles, and suggested the Australian deputy prime minister might have been supportive.""We talked about so many other things including the establishment of a full military force in this country,"" he saidGraeme Smith from the Australian National University said Mr Sogavare had nursed an ambition to set up a military in Solomon Islands for quite some time.""There are quite a few coded messages in his speech,"" Dr Smith said.""One of them seems to be — 'take steps to help us fulfil our legitimate aspiration to set up a military force, Australia.

And being the best partner we can be to the Solomon Islands is making sure we are there over the journey,"" he said.""And it's really that philosophy which is going to underpin this deployment but also the other ways we engage with Solomon Islands and its government.""Several defence personnel and 25 Australian Federal Police are currently deployed with the SIAF, while another 35 AFP officers are in Solomon Islands offering direct assistance to the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF)Anna Powles from Massey University told the ABC that Mr Marles might be taking the opportunity to ""do some early signalling that Australia is open to an ongoing commitment to Solomon Islands"".It's not clear if Solomon Islands would accept such an offer.Dr Powles said the government's decision would likely be ""determined by what the mission mandate would be"" but that Mr Sogavare might well be keen for additional security support to help with elections next year.""2024 may prove to be a challenging year with the delayed elections due to take place and the provision of additional security may be welcomed,"" she said.The Defence Minister's comments also come against the backdrop of the continuing contest between Australia and China for influence in Solomon Islands.Beijing signed a deeply contentious security pact with Honiara in April last year and has been rapidly expanding its police cooperation program since then.Last year China's government supplied dozens of motorbikes and two water cannon trucks to the RSIPF, well as expanding training programs for local police both in China and across multiple provinces in Solomon Islands.Australia also gifted police vehicles and handed over 60 semi-automatic rifles to Solomon Islands police, and has repeatedly declared it wants to be the Pacific country's main security partner.Multiple senior Australian officials have also made it clear they're uneasy about China's deepening involvement with Solomon Islands law enforcement agencies, suggesting it might be deeply destabilising.Dr Powles told the ABC that if Chinese police contingents were invited into Solomon Islands in the future it could create significant risks, particularly if there was an enduring Australian police presence in the country.""If there are multiple police forces operating in Solomon Islands — particularly those with distinct command and control — it will be critical to ensure communication lines and even a crisis hotline are put in place to reduce and manage any potential friction between the forces,"" she said.Mr Marles told the ABC that the relationship between Solomon Islands and Australia was both ""enduring"" and ""improving"" and that ""security within the Pacific should emanate from the Pacific family first.""He also said he would use his visit to Solomon Islands to build economic links and ensure Australia's development program was delivering what people needed in Solomon Islands.""We'll continue to focus on the way Australia can contribute to Solomon Islands development ... our focus needs to be on improving the development outcomes of all countries around the Pacific,"" he said.""And I'll look forward to having discussions with Mr Sogavare on how we can best improve that.""","China, Defence Forces, Defence Industry, Defence and National Security, Federal Government, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, Pacific, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2023-06-27T19:08:28+00:00

It's not just the environment but the people as well.""Thomas Crawford's Domavola is the latest in a long line of companies that have tried to log on Zaira land.In a video shot back in 2015, Mr Crawford can be seen addressing a community meeting on nearby Seghe island outlining his views on the benefits of logging.""Logging represents 50 to 60 to 70 to 80 per cent in certain areas of the income. We are a new company here. Why not give us an opportunity,"" he said.""Let's do something positive. Sitting on the edges and saying nothing and doing nothing will not achieve anything for anyone.""Hanz Jino rejects any suggestions that Mr Crawford, or any other foreigner, knows what is best for his community.""We don't accept that kind of advice,"" he said.""We don't need any person to dictate to us what we are supposed to do with our resources.""Mr Jino said he did not believe Mr Crawford or Domavola had his community's best interests at heart in deciding to conduct logging operations on Zaira land.""He should come to us and we should have a good conversation and dialogue and look at sustainable kind of developments instead of logging.""Hanz Jino says his fellow villagers have lodged a legal appeal against the decision to issue Domavola with a development consent.Company records show Mr Crawford was not one of Domavola's four founding shareholders when it was incorporated in September 2021.One of them was long-time MP, businessman and timber industry figure Bodo Dettke.Another was Wayne Maepioh, the former premier of Western Province.Records show Mr Dettke transferred his 25 per cent stake to another one of Mr Crawford's companies, Renown Surf and Cargo, in August last year.After the development consent was issued in November, Renown came to be the only shareholder and Mr Crawford, the only director.Mr Crawford, Mr Dettke and Mr Maepioh have all declined to comment about Domavola or why they sought to log at Zaira despite local opposition and the area's environmental significance.Dr Simon Albert said the situation highlighted how authorities in Solomon Islands favoured loggers over locals.""The economy, the whole legal structure of logging, timber rights, is set up in favour of extractive logging companies and people find it very hard to protect their land,"" he said.Whatever the outcome, Hanz Jino is adamant no-one will log the forests around Zaira.""We will keep fighting for our land, to protect our land.

And there are plenty of times where it's gone really well.When it comes to weeds alone, Australia has completed 58 control programs, as of 2017.Here are a few examples that demonstrate the power of biocontrols that are done right, and some of the challenges researchers face in finding suitable candidates.First recorded in Australia in 1917, skeleton weed was considered Australia's worst plant pest by the 1950s.Although it looks fairly innocuous, it wrought economic damage on a huge scale, particularly in Australia's eastern wheatbelts.""It's got these really wiry flower structures and ... the harvesting machine gets stuck on them,"" said Mariana Campos, CSIRO's team leader of ecosystem change and ecology.""[The plant] contains latex as well, so it all gets gummy. Not only does it stop the harvester from actually working, it also contaminates the grain.""Wheat crop yields were cut by up to 80 per cent, farmland was abandoned, and estimated losses in the 1960s were around $30 million a year — more than $200 million in today's value.In 1966, researchers from CSIRO began investigating possible pathogens in the skeleton weed's native range around the Mediterranean.Scouring Mediterranean Europe east to Iran, they came up with an initial list of nine possibilities.Then they spent several years testing for host specificity, which CSIRO's team leader in plant diagnostics Gavin Hunter said is the ""core tenet"" of biocontrol today.""That is the bedrock upon which we operate as control researchers,"" Dr Hunter said.""In terms of skeleton weed, I think they tested a total of [around] 57 non-target species against the candidate biocontrol agents to prove they were [species] specific."" With a laboratory eventually set up in Montpellier, France, they narrowed their list down to four possibilities. The first of those was released on the Australian east coast in 1971, followed by three more.Three of the four became established and one in particular, a rust fungus called Puccinia chondrillina, decimated the weed. The two others, a mite and gall midge, worked to further weaken the plant.In all, CSIRO estimates the program saved the Australian economy more than $1.4 billion, with a cost-to-benefit ratio of 112-to-one.In Australia, there are three ""biotypes"" of skeleton weed — they're all the same species, but one has narrow leaves, another intermediate, and the third broad leaves.The biocontrols were so specific that they only had a significant effect on the worst of the three, the narrow form.All three types of skeleton weed still persist in Australia's east, albeit in much lower amounts.But the west took a different approach, opting to suppress the weed through physical and chemical means rather than going all out on a biological control.That program is ongoing in Western Australia, via an annual levy paid by grain producers. The WA Department of Primary Industries estimates that program costs around $3.4 million per year, at a cost-benefit ratio of one-to-three over 30 years.Prickly pear was first introduced to Australia by Governor Phillip in 1788, for the purpose of setting up a cochineal dye industry.At the time, red dye was valuable and was used, among other things, to create the distinctive red coats worn by the New South Wales Corps or Rum Corps. The dye was extracted from a cochineal scale insect — Dactylopius coccus— which feeds on the spiky leaves of the cactus.But the cochineal insect didn't take well to Australian conditions, and the dye industry floundered.Not so the prickly pear, which was prized for its hardiness, bright flowers and edible fruit.By 1840 it had found its way to Chinchilla in Queensland, and by 1920 it had taken over around 60 million acres of farmland, mostly in Queensland and New South Wales.Arsenic was used to try to control the weed in such quantities that a mine was opened in Queensland to meet increased demand for the poison.But the cactus continued advancing, swallowing more than 2 million acres a year at its peak.Farms were abandoned, cash was offered for a solution (but never collected), and everything from flamethrowers to tanks and enlisting returned soldiers for a military assault was floated.The eventual solution was nowhere near as dramatic but far more devastating — the combination of a moth and some scale insects.Following the release of the cactus-eating Cactoblastis moth larvae in 1926, ""within 10 years, the once dense-fields of common prickly pear lay rotting or had vanished completely"", according to the CSIRO.By 1932, 7 million hectares of land was reopened to farming.Today, most of the credit goes to the Cactoblastis moth, but biocontrol researcher Michael Furlong of the University of Queensland says it was a team effort.""The important thing is it wasn't just Cactoblastis ... there were cochineal insects — small-scale insects — introduced as well, and if it hadn't been for them, the Cactoblastis likely wouldn't have worked,"" Professor Furlong said.""The cochineal insect was extremely important, and is still very prevalent in areas around western Queensland today."" Myxomatosis and calicivirus are probably the best known biocontrols to have been used in Australia.But there was a long time before these viruses came onto the scene. Until then, building fences and ""rabbit drives"" were the only tools available.Rabbit drives involved herding often thousands of rabbits at a time into enclosures, before clubbing them to death en masse.Fence-building was a huge operation, and had some limited success, but weaknesses were invariably found, and rabbits made their way across.Desperate times led to the attempted introduction (not by CSIRO) of mongoose as a biocontrol during the 1880s.Around 1,000 mongoose were released in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales, but thankfully all failed to take hold. Mongoose today are considered among the world's most destructive invasive pests.By 1887, New South Wales was offering a 25,000 pound reward for anyone who could come up with a novel idea to exterminate the pests.In the 1890s, a virus that was killing rabbits in a lab in Uruguay was discovered.But there wasn't much appetite to take a risk on releasing a virus here, and the idea was shelved.It wasn't until 1950 that public sentiment, combined with research and political support, saw the introduction of myxomatosis. Myxomatosis is a disease caused by the myxoma poxvirus, and spread by mosquitoes.CSIRO vertebrate management systems group lead Tanja Strive said wildlife biologists don't really like to put a number on how many rabbits there were, because it's always fluctuated, but that best estimates suggest about half a billion in Australia at their peak.""They talk about the 'grey blanket' before myxomatosis,"" Dr Strive said.""[Myxomatosis] was slow to get going initially, but then there was good rainfall and suddenly there was an enormous number of mosquitoes.""Then it really took off and had a massive knockdown of the rabbit population — over 90 per cent in some areas.""But the honeymoon was short-lived. The longer rabbits lived, the longer they could pass on the virus, so evolutionary pressure was favouring more resistant rabbits and less virulent myxomatosis. ""Quickly, in two or three years, the effectiveness was starting to wane.""By the mid-1980s, the numbers were not as high as pre-myxo, but pretty high again.""In the meantime, CSIRO had been searching for alternatives, and an emerging virus had appeared in rabbits in China.Calicivirus, also known as rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus, attacks the internal organs of the animal and is usually fatal within 30 hours. Following four years of laboratory testing, in the mid-1990s, CSIRO set up a quarantine research station on Wardang Island in South Australia, when the virus they were testing — calicivirus — escaped on feeding flies.""Once that got off the island and into the almost completely naive Australian [rabbit] population, again it basically wiped out over 90 per cent of rabbits in some cases,"" Dr Strive said.""So it was a raging success again, but over time, much slower than myxo, we've seen some resistance developing.""Which is inevitable in disease biocontrol.Another new strain of calicivirus made its own way here around 2014, and another was deliberately released in 2017, both of which knocked down the population.As well as saving the Australian economy billions, the rabbit biocontrol program has also had a knock-on effect on cat numbers, which has enabled some small native mammal species to recover.CSIRO is currently researching new viruses in rabbits both here and overseas, and looking at ways to improve the impact of calicivirus and myxomatosis.""We're pursuing a number of avenues,"" Dr Strive said.""Ideally we'll have a new tool, or virus, or strategy ready every 10 to 15 years because what we don't want is for numbers to get away again.""The coconut rhinoceros beetle or ""palm killer"" is an example of how biocontrol can be a moveable feast.The coconut rhinoceros beetle was first detected in Samoa just over 100 years ago, far outside its native south-east Asian range, according to Professor Furlong.""It's a large beetle that attacks coconut palms.""It first got into the Pacific in 1909, devastating coconuts there, particularly in Samoa.""In the early 1960s, a virus was found in rhinoceros beetles in Malaysia and was introduced to Samoa with very promising early results.""It's not immediately lethal [but] ... it reduces their overall fitness — how much females can move and fly, and it reduces the number of eggs they lay, and that leads to overall population suppression.""The Oryctes virus is also transmitted easily between beetles and spreads rapidly.For years the virus played an integral role in suppressing beetle numbers across the Pacific.But in the mid-2000s, the virus's efficacy seemed to be waning.Attempts to infect beetles on Guam failed, leading to a hypothesis that the Guam beetles were immune, and the coconut rhinoceros beetle (Guam) type was named.Similar beetles designated as the Guam type showed up in Papua New Guinea, Hawaii, and Palau, the Solomon Islands in 2015, and Vanuatu in 2019.In response, countries like the Solomon Islands have declared local states of emergency and launched offensives to try to stymie the beetle's spread.A worst-case scenario of 50 per cent palm losses, would devastate the local oil palm, copra and coconut oil industries, which provide 10 to 15 per cent or more GDP to some Pacific countries.The beetle also attacks bananas, pineapple and other crops, leading to warnings for Australia to do more to help control the beetle for its own, and its neighbours' benefit.But Kayvan Etebari, a molecular biologist at the University of Queensland, doesn't believe the Guam type is immune, or that the Guam type has spread across the Pacific.""There is no scientific evidence to prove that particular [Guam] population is resistant,"" Dr Etebari said.He is working to understand why the virus is no longer suppressing beetle numbers, and said he thinks the virus-insect relationship has changed.""When we screen the beetles, most of them have the virus infection. So if this is the case the first question is, 'Why is the virus not killing the insect?'""That's why I believe the virus and insect has changed to a more 'friendly' relationship.""[But] that can change again. It's not going to stay the same for another 10 years.""In the meantime, he's looking for another virus: ""But finding a novel virus is not an easy job.""He's also working with the Oryctes virus to see if it might be able to do the job the cane toad failed to do.""We want to use the same virus to see if it can control the cane grub, which doesn't have any biological control agent at the moment.""","Chinchilla, Environment, Environmental Management, Guam, Papua New Guinea, Pests, Science and Technology, Solomon Islands, ",2023-04-19T08:25:17+00:00
30,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-03-22/solomon-islands-china-us-japan-visits/102123368,"You could call it a Switzerland-like foreign relations policy — just in the Pacific.""Friends to all, enemy to none"" is how Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare describes it.The phrase itself — something Mr Sogavare repeats over and over — has become official government policy.Even in a nation colloquially known as the Hapi Isles, it may seem like a bit of a stretch. But these days, on the very surface at least, it seems the ""policy"" is paying off: Solomon Islands is more popular than ever.Over the past three days, Mr Sogavare's office has been like a mini-United Nations. On Sunday, he shook hands with Japanese foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi — the first time in history that a Japanese foreign minister has made the trip to Honiara.On the same day, he welcomed a delegation from the China International Development Agency, a group touring the capital to inspect key infrastructure projects, such as the new national stadium, being funded by the Chinese government.  And on Tuesday he hosted the United States Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell — the man the Biden administration has backed to lead his country's new-found ""step-up"" in the region.   It's a busy schedule for the leader of a small, largely rural nation of about 700,000 people spread out across almost 1,000 islands.    So, why is Solomon Islands hosting so many big, superpower friends all of a sudden?  ""The real flashpoint was Solomon Islands' security agreement with China,"" Lowy Institute Pacific Island Program director Meg Keen told the ABC.""[That] sent shock waves through the region.""The controversial security agreement, revealed during last year's federal election, propelled Solomon Islands into the national and international spotlight.It came after the country switched long-held diplomatic allegiances from Taiwan to China in 2019, and stoked fears that China would build a military base in the country — a move Mr Sogavare has constantly and aggressively denied.Ignoring the debate over the implications of the agreement, Dr Keen says China's increased engagement has at the very least been a ""catalyst for action"" for other nations, including Australia and the US. ""Now we're seeing traditional partners increase their action on the ground,"" she said. ""The US is back now, and back in multiple ways.""   Unlike his Japanese counterpart who declined to speak to the local media during his whirlwind visit, US Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell held a lengthy press conference on Tuesday. The US, which has been largely absent from the country since WWII, has re-emerged over the past three years, opening an embassy, re-establishing diplomatic ties and committing to help in what it described as the ""urgent demands of climate change and illegal fishing"". Speaking at the press conference — where Mr Sogavare was not present — Mr Campbell provided a kind-of mea culpa when talking about why the US had suddenly re-emerged in Solomon Islands and the Pacific more generally. ""We did not do enough before,"" he said.""And as a great nation as a big country, I think we were big enough to admit that that we need to do more, and we need to do better.""So when you ask the question, where are you stepping up? My answer would be everywhere.""   Speaking on Solomon Islands' security security agreement with China, Mr Campbell was unequivocal.He said ""more transparency"" over the agreement — which has never been made public — would be ""appropriate"". And, he said, the US delegation ""made clear its expectations"" around any potential Chinese military facilities ""going forward"". ""And I thought that was very clear what our expectations are in this regard,"" he said. ""We received very clear assurances from the prime minister that he had no intention and will not move towards creating a military facility in the Solomons that would support power projection capabilities.""As the Sogavare government prepares to face an election early next year, on the streets of Honiara the response to these visits — and their impact — ranges wildly.As the new national stadium nears completion, Solomon Islanders living in the capital can now see the physical results of the geopolitical tug-of-war.Yet, according to some the ABC spoke to, many question why they're getting a shiny new stadium for the upcoming November Pacific Games, yet the nation's major hospital is in tatters. And issues such as endemic youth unemployment and poverty continue to hurt the nation's development. In a political sense, the turmoil that sparked the November 2021 riots has calmed for the time being.   Mr Sogavare and his government continues to face criticism, particularly around its decisions to introduce Chinese policing methods into its domestic security arsenal. Vocal anti-China critic Daniel Suidani was also pushed out of political power in his home province — a move analysts say came about in suspicious circumstances.  Yet, in a move welcomed by local journalists, the government's attempts to quell the media have calmed, with ministers now conducting weekly press conferences. According to Dr Keen, Mr Sogavare's hold on power is ""finely balanced"".  ""He has to be seen to be delivering,"" she said. ""He's getting attention and resources and he's getting global leaders to come to the table.""But it's a delicate balance, this is a tough geopolitical game to play well while navigating domestic sensitivities.""International diplomacy may be one thing, but domestic politics -- and clinging to power -- is another. With that in mind, perhaps a new phrase is more appropriate: ""Friends to none, enemies to some"".  ","China, Defence and National Security, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Japan, National Security, Pacific, Solomon Islands, United States, ",2023-03-21T19:01:27+00:00
31,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-03-03/controversy-baron-waqa-pacific-islands-forum-general-secretary/102038644,"The appointment of former Nauruan president Baron Waqa to the Pacific's most senior diplomatic posting has drawn criticism from human rights groups and former political opponents.Mr Waqa — who has a controversial record on human rights and press freedom — has been selected to lead the Pacific Islands Forum as secretary-general starting next year.The choice was part of a deal to bring Micronesian countries back into the fold after they threatened to leave the intergovernmental body in 2021.But there are already calls to reconsider Mr Waqa's appointment to the position, which was announced at a special meeting of Pacific leaders last week.Amnesty International's Pacific researcher, Kate Scheutze, said that Mr Waqa had been president when serious human rights violations allegedly occurred in Australian immigration detention centres on Nauru.""In some cases that amounted to sexual abuse and torture of refugees and asylum seekers,"" she said.""The Australian government and companies and corporations working in that offshore processing system also had a role to play, but that by no means absolves the Nauru government of responsibility.""The allegations made by Amnesty International haven’t been tested in court and Nauru’s government has denied claims of abuse.Reopened in 2012 under the Gillard government, Australia's offshore processing centre on Nauru remains the single biggest source of income for the Pacific nation.In 2018, Mr Waqa was heavily criticised for ordering medical NGO Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to stop providing mental health treatment to refugees on the island.His government accused the organisation of ""conspiring against Nauru"" after MSF called for all asylum seekers to be immediately evacuated over concerns for their wellbeing.Refugee Action Coalition spokesperson Ian Rintoul said the decision to appoint Mr Waqa's as secretary-general of the PIF was astonishing.""Particularly given his history as president of Nauru – it's a notorious history,"" Mr Rintoul said.""The Pacific Island Forum is totally discredited by having Baron Waqa at the top of it.""While in office from 2013 until 2019, Mr Waqa was also accused of suppressing freedom of speech by banning Facebook, restricting the media and prosecuting citizens who spoke against his government.""He presided over a period of Nauru's history, which is a very dark chapter,"" Ms Scheutze said.In a famous case known as the Nauru 19, a group of opposition MPs and their supporters were slapped with criminal charges after staging a protest outside Nauru's parliament house in 2015.The charges were thrown out by independent Australian judge, Geoffrey Muecke, who said a fair trial was not possible due to a lack of judicial independence.He found the Nauruan government had blacklisted the group, preventing them from gaining employment or income from property, and had deliberately attempted to influence the court.Justice Muecke then had his contract terminated by the Nauruan government before a retrial.In 2019, the group was found guilty of rioting and unlawful assembly.Members claim they were denied legal assistance, access to international lawyers and some had their passports seized so they could not leave the country.The case sparked international outcry and prompted New Zealand to withdraw judicial aid to Nauru.Squire Jeremiah, a former opposition MP and one of the Nauru 19, fled to Australia where he is currently seeking humanitarian protection.He said Mr Waqa's appointment would undermine the integrity of the Pacific Islands Forum.The regional body lists human rights, transparency and accountability as its core values.""I just can't imagine how they [have] come up with this,"" Mr Jeremiah said.""It's really unacceptable to me and they should reconsider and change the nomination.""Ms Schuetze, from Amnesty International, said while diverse representation within the forum was important, leaders should be chosen based on their commitment to its values.""People of credibility, who bring with them some sort of knowledge and expertise in terms of human rights and really promoting the rights and interests of Pacific Island peoples,"" she said.The ABC has sought comment from Mr Waqa through a range of channels and has approached the Pacific Islands Forum and Micronesian leaders for comment.Since his defeat in Nauru's 2019 election, Mr Waqa has been largely out of the political spotlight.In 2022 he led the Commonwealth Observers Mission for elections in Papua New Guinea.His rise to power within the PIF was clinched under a deal, known as the Suva Agreement, to bring Micronesian countries back to the group after they threatened to leave in 2021.The deal also included establishing a PIF sub-regional office in Micronesia and a new Pacific Ocean Commissioner position.Tess Newton Cain, project lead for the Griffith University Pacific Hub, said the Micronesian countries agreed that a Nauruan candidate would be put forward to be the next secretary general.""I think the particular person that they've selected is something of a surprise,"" she said.""There were other names being mentioned … who possibly have more of a profile in terms of international and regional and global diplomacy than Baron Waqa does.""She said the former Nauruan president would have his work cut out for him, with intensifying geopolitical interest in the region.""It's a particularly big job at the moment, given the increased level of interest in the region and more partners wanting to have a bigger presence,"" she said.Mr Waqa famously clashed with a Chinese diplomat during a 2018 meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum and accused Beijing of bullying smaller countries.Nauru also maintains diplomatic ties with Taiwan.But Dr Newton Cain said Mr Waqa's personal attitude towards China may be of little consequence.""To a large extent, it shouldn't matter,"" she said.""His position is to lead the Forum Secretariat as secretary general, in order to operationalise the wishes and the decisions of the Pacific leadership.""","China, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Nauru, Pacific, Solomon Islands, United States, World Politics, ",2023-03-02T19:43:30+00:00

I think there's going to be so many people apply and so many will miss out.""Under the scheme, citizens from around the Pacific can apply with the winners selected in a so-called ""visa lottery"".If their name is drawn, applicants will then have to secure a work offer from an Australian employer to be eligible.They will also have to pass a health check and a character test, and be able to speak some English.The scheme, which the government hopes to have up and running by July, is only open to people between the ages of 18 and 45.The visa plan was broadly welcomed across the Pacific on Thursday, with leaders generally backing the move.  Speaking to the ABC in Suva, Fiji Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka said he welcomed the visa as it was ""open directly to the people"" and not a ""government-to-government"" deal.However, he raised concerns about its impact on the local labour market in Fiji ""We need to look at the whole process of providing employment for our people,"" he said.""And I think [these schemes] will be detrimental to our economy.""  Pacific experts also warned if word spread across the region — and it was expected to — there could be many disappointed Pacific Islanders. Griffith University Pacific Hub project lead Tess Newton Cain told the ABC's Pacific Beat program the Australian government needed to get out and spread the message to make sure there was no confusion.   ""I think there will need to be quite a lot of work done in Pacific Island countries to ensure that everyone understand what this is,"" she said. The scheme is modelled on a New Zealand immigration program, which also has a ballot system. In Suva, Vaine Kuila, who lived and worked in New Zealand, said the move by Australia sent a good signal.  ""I strongly believe it's high time Australia steps up and makes us understand that we truly are a Pacific family,"" she said. Ms Kuila runs commercial poultry farms and knows the labour situation in the Pacific well.  Although she said it was undoubtably a very good opportunity, like Mr Rabuka she believed there was a danger it would contribute to a drain Fiji's skilled people. ","Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Solomon Islands, ",2023-02-16T19:13:16+00:00

Instead, the family relies on solar panels to charge batteries and power other necessities.When the weather's bad — which is often — they pay a neighbour one dollar to help them charge their phones.But even then, they're still often left in the dark.""It affects our children's studies, particularly before exam period,"" he said. The figures show the reason why Peter is struggling. According to UK-based aggregate website Cable, Solomon Islands has the unwanted title of the world's most expensive electricity, just above fellow Pacific nations Vanuatu and Cook Islands, which sit in third and fourth place respectively. The research, released in December 2021, analysed 230 countries and found on average electricity in Solomon Islands cost $1.03 per kWh.The cheapest electricity in the world is in Libya and costs $0.01 cents per kWh.  The research found Australia's rate was 26 cents per kWh.According to Martin Sam, the acting chief executive of state-owned Solomon Power, the country's energy authority, the causes of the high prices are ""complex"". He says the country's geography, with a population of 700,000 spread over hundreds of islands, is one cause. The other is the source of electricity.""98 per cent of the [country's] power generation is from diesel,"" he said. ""That is the main cause of the the high electricity price in the country."" On top of the cost, according to advocacy groups only about 15 to 20 per cent of Solomon Islanders have access to power. For Solomon Islands' MP Peter Kenilorea, it is a major roadblock in the country's economic growth and ""not something to be proud of"".   Mr Kenilorea, an opposition MP and outspoken critic of the Sogavare government, says the impacts of the high costs of power are ""massive"".  And he says ""corruption"" and a lack of political will has stifled energy policy in the country. ""It's a tough comment for me to make, but there are players that don't see [personal gain] for them in the energy sector, as they see clearly in [something like] logging,"" he says.""When you have a high cost of energy and power, then it translates to a high cost of living.""So businesses [find] it difficult to grow and expand, just because of the cost of fuel is so high. Power is the big mover behind any developments and economic growth, it permeates every level of society.""Without power [we] might as well go back to the Dark Ages.""Solomon Islands Government energy division director John Korinihona rejected any accusation of corruption or self-interest from the government as a cause of the high energy costs, and instead pointed to a planned ""tariff reduction"" to help reduce costs.  Yet, for business owner Craig Day, it cannot come soon enough. Mr Day, who has run a fuel station franchise and accommodation business in the capital for the past 50 years, says new businesses have been forced to close because of the high cost of power. And, he says, it has impacted his business. ""We've been forced to remove air conditioning and close down the ice production machines,"" he says.""Those machines alone, were costing $50,000 Solomons per month ($9,000) to run to produce ice."" But, according to the Solomons government, there are more solutions in the works. About 20 kilometres south-east of Honiara, the long-awaited Tina River hydropower project is getting closer to completion.      Feasibility studies for the project began in 2009. And in 2012 it was hoped power would come by 2017. More delays have since beset the project, which is partly funded by the Australian government and NGOs such as the Green Climate Fund and Asia Development Bank.The Solomon Islands government told the ABC it is hoped to be up and running by ""2025 or 2026"". When it is live Mr Korinihona says it will provide of 93 per cent of the Honiara grid, or 82 per cent of all power stations in the country, displacing a ""substantial amount"" of reliance on diesel fuel. ""This is a significant reduction in Solomon Power's annual fossil fuel consumption and in turn reduces the electricity tariff,"" he said. Back in Honiara, Peter simply hopes the proposed changes will allow him to access cheaper electricity, so he can help his children achieve their dreams. ""My plan is for Bridget to be a doctor, Shirwin to be a lawyer, Julius to be a pilot, Pius to work for the church . . . this is my dream,"" he said. ""Having access to electricity can enable children to do studies at night, [that's] something I want for them.""The Pacific program airs on the international ABC Australia service on Thursdays at 7pm, in Australia on the ABC News Channel on Thursdays at 9:30pm and on Fridays at 10:30am on ABC TV.

As long as the world fails to eliminate our collective addiction to fossil fuels, climate impacts will only get worse and more and more people will suffer,"" she said. Through the resolution, world leaders asked the ICJ to form an advisory opinion clarifying international legal consensus on climate change's impacts on human rights and the rights of future generations.The opinion will be non-binding, but experts say it could influence the outcome of climate change court cases around the world.As the UN's judicial arm, the ICJ is often asked to provide answers to legal questions to guide UN organisations and member countries. These are called advisory opinions and outline what current international law has to say about a given legal question brought to the court through a UN resolution.While the court's rulings are not binding, they influence international opinion.In the past, the ICJ has considered the legality of constructing an Israeli-built separation barrier, and ordered Myanmar to prevent acts of genocide against Rohingya Muslims. The opinions themselves are not judgements, and the ICJ does not have the power to jail, fine or punish individuals or companies on the basis of them.But according to Professor Margaret Young, an international law expert at Melbourne Law School, they carry legal weight and moral authority that can influence future decisions.""Advisory opinions are requests from United Nations organs like the General Assembly for advice on legal questions to guide those organs in how they respond to issues ... [and] are not intended to be binding on states.""The resolution, drafted by 18 countries, has asked the ICJ to rule on:What obligations do states, under international law, have to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases for States and for present and future generationsWhat legal consequences there are under these obligations for states where they, by their acts and omissions, have caused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment, with respect to:(a) States, including, in particular, small island developing states, which due to their geographical circumstances and level of development, are injured or specially affected by or are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change(b) Peoples and individuals of the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate changeProfessor Young said despite being non-binding, ICJ opinions were effective and could influence laws overseas.This was highlighted in an advisory opinion on the sovereignty of Western Sahara in 1975.""Australia didn't participate in that opinion, but subsequently, that opinion was cited by our High Court in the landmark Mabo decision of 1992 that found terra nullius to be a legal fiction in Australia, leading to massive changes to the law,"" Professor Young said.Advisory opinions on climate change could strengthen legal cases and clarify where countries are responsible for the carbon they emit, she said.""There is still uncertainty about the content of state obligations, despite the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.""Vanuatu, home to about 300,000 people across roughly 80 islands, has been labelled the most at-risk country in the world for natural disasters. In late February, Vanuatu was hit by two cyclones just days apart, shining a light on its vulnerability to climate change.But this push was an initiative by University of the South Pacific law students in 2019 who worked to get climate justice on the UN's agenda.Vanuatu's Climate Change Minister Ralph Regenvanu, who then began raising their plight to world leaders, said the country had always led on issues of climate justice.""We were a founding member of the association of small island states and the first chairman of that group, which is now one of the main climate lobbies at COP,"" he said.""We were the country to first raise loss and damage in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1981.""We've been a leader in many ways on climate change.""With Vanuatu's cyclone season ending in May, Mr Regenvanu said the biggest concern was being unable to keep people safe amid flooding, saltwater inundation and sea level rise. ""It's happening right now, and people are not safe right now,"" he said.He said relocating entire populations from flood-prone areas and building new infrastructure was a ""huge challenge"" for the cash-strapped developing nation.""We only graduated from least developed country status less than two years ago,"" he said.""We are a very poor developing country; we don't have the necessary money we need to build resilient infrastructure like new roads to withstand the impacts of climate change, which require 10 times the investment you need for a normal road.""That's why we've been fighting for this issue of loss and damage for a long time because we really desperately need the money, and it's a problem we didn't cause."" Mr Regenvanu hopes an advisory opinion will embolden Pacific people in their fight for climate justice.""The good thing about an ICJ advisory opinion is that no matter what court you're arguing — whether it be at the lowest level or the highest level — it applies,"" he said.""It can be used in any court as a persuasive precedent."" ","Climate Change, Climate Change - Disasters, Cook Islands, Fiji, Government and Politics, Intergovernmental Organisations, International Courts and Tribunals, Kiribati, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Niue, Pacific, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, ",2023-03-29T21:07:39+00:00

It is a great way of deepening our strong relationships with the region.""The bills to bring the new visa scheme about will reportedly be introduced to parliament on Thursday.Last year, the visa scheme was announced in April as part of the then-opposition's wider commitment to increasing aid to the Pacific to counter China's rising influence in the region.At the time it was announced, Stephen Howes from the Australian National University said the proposal was ""unique"" and ""very significant"".""So far, all the labour mobility schemes for the Pacific have been temporary … but this is different in that it allows Pacific Islanders to move to Australia with their families and stay here,"" he said.Professor Howes said the policy seemed aimed at building up Australia's Pacific diaspora, which remains very small.""While 3,000 might not sound like a lot, those numbers will accumulate — I think you could quickly see this become more important than the temporary schemes.""In a statement the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told the ABC that boosting permanent migration to Australia was an essential part of the government's plan to ""build a stronger Pacific family"".""The Pacific Engagement Visa will grow Australia's Pacific diaspora, build on our strong people-to-people links, and encourage greater cultural, business, and educational exchange"", the statement said.According to DFAT, consultations are ongoing with regional partners to determine proposed country allocations and participation.The new visa overhauls Australia's standing Pacific labour mobility schemes, and effectively abolishes the Nationals' plan for a standalone agriculture visa by wrapping it into existing Pacific programs.Allan Bird, the governor of East Sepik Province in Papua New Guinea and a member of government, said it was a good way to solve economic issues in the region.""I think it's about time, because all the Pacific Island countries share a bond with Australia,"" he told the ABC.""There are many jobs that Australian citizens do not want to do, and I think it would be to the advantage of both Australia and South Pacific that those jobs come to the Pacific.""He said allowing Pacific Island citizens to take their families and live in Australia would help offer people on the visas a different perspective.""They get to experience the values and culture of Australia and pick up the work ethic as well, which I think is important,"" he said.""We need citizens who have a different view of the world.""Solomon Islands Permanent Secretary of Foreign Affairs Colin Beck backed the government's new visa scheme.""Any of these economic opportunities, including labour, mobility and long-term stay — that is something that is very much welcomed by Solomon Islands,"" Mr Beck told the ABC.""This is something that we have been continually working on with the Australian government.""Vanuatu Finance Minister John SalongI said he welcomes the change that is happening in Australia, but wants to see the measure go further to allow reciprocal visa-free entry for residents of Vanuatu into Australia.""We already have good exchanges between workers in Vanuatu and approved employees in Australia,"" he said.""Once the government provides that legislative environment, people will make the best choices that they will for their own selves.""For Vanuatu’s disaster-prone islands, Mr SalongI said restriction free entry to Australia for those who fit the appropriate criteria would provide much-needed opportunity for those who need to leave their homes.""Not only to move into other islands in Vanuatu, but they can also move to another place where they might have better income opportunities for themselves, and maybe better opportunities for their children in terms of access to education, access to future work, and professional upbringing,"" he said.","Australia, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Immigration, Immigration Policy, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Nauru, Pacific, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, ",2023-02-15T21:34:53+00:00

Because like, 'oh, just betel nut'.""Mr Lengi had left Honiara airport chewing betel nut, but forgot he had left the skin of the fruit in his pocket which he planned to use to clean his teeth. Ten kilograms of betel nut are allowed to be imported under Australian biosecurity laws, but any fleshy material must be removed beforehand. Mr Lengi was thankful to be let off with a warning, and has since travelled freely with his supply of betel nuts. In Australia, demand for betel nut is soaring, driven partly by the expansion of a Pacific workers program that now includes the aged care, hospitality and tourism sectors and sees a 3,000-strong Solomon Islander worker population.However, even though it's legal to bring a small amount of betel nut into Australia for personal use, it's a restricted product and illegal to sell here for human consumption. One Solomon Islands biosecurity officer, who asked not to be named, said they were witnessing an increase in the amount of betel nut taken from Honiara to Australia — all of it happening at an informal level.Honiara-based suppliers of betel nut peel, freeze and pack the product ready for it to be taken overseas and sold.At Honiara's trading hub, Regina Gwaena waits with more than 50 other betel nut sellers in small roadside stalls for their daily supply to arrive.""Getting the right kind of betel nut is difficult work. We have to wait at the wharves, the coastlines, or at the betel nut markets,"" she said.""When we buy the betel nuts, we remove the skin and we wrap it in a plastic wrap before putting it in the aluminium foil and into the freezer.""Ms Gwaena has been supplying betel nut to Australia for more than a year, having Wantoks (kinship group) or close relatives sell her product abroad and transfer back the proceeds.Seasonal worker Emele Delaiverata says she spends up to $200 a week on betel nut and insists it is a better option than fast food.""I would rather spend $50 on betel nut and not KFC,"" she said.""It's expensive but when there's betel nut we don't even think about the price.""Betel nut comes from the areca palm, which grows in South-East Asia and Pacific countries.The nut is often chewed wrapped in betel leaves, with lime powder, mustard stick, spices, or tobacco. ""It's like a pack. And there's like two betel nuts and three fruit leaves,"" Ms Delaiverata said.She said selling the nut in Australia translated into a lot of money back home. ""So it's $10 Australian for a betel nut. You compare that back home as almost, what $60 Solomon dollars.""In the Asia-Pacific region, chewing betel nut has long been an important cultural practice, with children as young as eight partaking, but this has led to major health problems. While it has some positive antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, research has found chewing the nut can cause mouth and oesophageal cancer, as well as tooth decay, discolouration and gum disease.The soaring black market trade has had health experts concerned about the number of migrants presenting to dentists with oral cancer.In an earlier interview with the ABC, Australian Dental Association oral medicine specialist Professor Michael McCullough said removing cancers caused by betel nut chewing often disfigures patients. Professor McCullough said ulcers that do not heal, changes in mouth texture, and white patches of soft tissue that cannot be rubbed away with a finger or cloth were common signs of mouth cancer. Betel nut is the fourth-most widely used psychoactive substance worldwide, after nicotine, alcohol and caffeine, and research shows about 10 per cent of the world's population chew it in some capacity.The nut is so popular, Solomon Islanders in Australia are even willing to pay for it to be posted to them.""Sometimes if we live far away people post it over to us. And then we have paid for the betel nut and the posting as well,"" Ms Delaiverata said. Suppliers in Honiara might be meeting the demand in Australia, but Mr Lengi said there was a more convenient solution for those living in the Northern Territory. ""There's betel nut trees everywhere [around Darwin] so I usually buy betel nuts from a lady from PNG and her husband, and also an old couple from East Timor,"" he said.Mr Lengi said he paid a fraction of what it costs in other cities.""If I pay $10 I get 10 fruits, but if I buy in Brisbane or somewhere I might get like three fruits [for $10], so it's way cheaper.""So when I'm in Darwin I chew a lot of betel nut.""In addition to the 10kg limit, any imported betel nut must be free of pests and disease. But it is not allowed to be sold as food for human consumption, because the active ingredient, arecoline, is prohibited under the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code and considered a schedule 4 poison.In a statement, a Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries spokesperson said betel nut does not require a biosecurity permit, but it must comply with two sets of legislation, the Biosecurity Act 2015 and the Imported Food Control Act 1992.The acts only apply to betel nut that is imported commercially for human consumption. ""Any person who brings or imports betel nuts into Australia that fail to comply with the specified biosecurity import conditions may be subject to a financial penalty of up to 1,000 penalty units or imprisonment up to 5 years, or both, in accordance with section 186 of the Biosecurity Act 2015,"" the department statement said.""Under the Imported Food Control Act 1992 the maximum penalty for importing food that does not meet applicable standards and to which the act applies, is 10 years' imprisonment.""","Agribusiness, Australia, Business Enterprises, Darwin, Drug and Substance Abuse, Fruit, Health, Pacific, Solomon Islands, ",2023-01-19T19:47:17+00:00

One has even been tracked to swim across to California. Leatherbacks are truly incredible creatures. They can weigh up to a ton, yet can dive down to depths of over a kilometre, spend over an hour underwater on a single breath, and can hit speed bursts faster than a bottlenose dolphin.They are the fastest, largest and are the most ancient  of all sea turtles. The turtle's co-mascot — and namesake — has things a bit easier.Soon the other Solo — and its entourage — will complete their six-month tour through Solomon Islands nine provinces.This month Solo will visit 26 communities and villages during its final trip in Malaita province.Upright, and with dance moves and hugs for all, the polyester and foam mascot is hyping the Pacific Games to be held this November, and spreading a turtle conservation message across the islands at the same time.Solomon Islands boast some of the largest turtle nesting grounds in the Pacific.Sea turtles are intrinsic to the archipelago's culture.For thousands of years, the green, hawksbill and leatherback sea turtles have followed an ancestral, biological drive to lay their eggs on the same beaches in Solomon Islands every mating cycle.However, despite many tribes considering the gentle creatures a sacred animal, the latter half of the 20th century was catastrophic for sea turtles.Commercial harvesting for shells and meat, as well as egg collection, has driven populations to near extinction.All three Solomon Islands nesting species are classified as endangered, with the hawksbill and Western Pacific leatherback reaching ""critically endangered"" status.Current adult female numbers of hawkbill turtles that nest in Solomon Islands are believed to have dwindled to a few thousand, whereas the number of adult leatherback turtles that nest in Solomon Islands are in the hundreds.However, Solomon Islands has been fighting the devastation for decades, with some success.Marine conservation areas and protected zones, paired with community-led ranger programs, have make an impact.The 40,000-acre Arnavon Islands Community Marine Park was the first nationally protected area in Solomon Islands, established in 1995.Some reports attribute a 200 per cent increase of hawksbill nests to the Arnavon's protection status.The Nature Conservancy (TNC) says hawksbill turtles dig around 2,000 nests a year within the marine park.TNC has been working in Solomon Islands for 30 years and has partnered with the Pacific Games Organising Committee (GOC) for the 2023 Pacific Games.Also tracking Solo the leatherback, the TNC will continue to release the data of her travels leading up to the November kick of for the games.Solomon Islands latest conservation initiative is proving a winner.A highlight was when the turtle mascot released a live hawksbill back into a Marine Protected Area from Boe Boe Village in Choiseul province.""Seeing Solo, a sea turtle, being the Games Official Mascot gives us even more joy,"" Boe Boe village elder Derald Daza Daniel said.Mr Daniel echoed similar sentiments shared by those in the other provinces that Solo has visited, with the mascot's nationwide tour making people feel part of the Pacific Games.Games chief executive Peter Stewart said he was hopeful the messages both Solos could spread awareness throughout Solomon Islands to help protect sea turtles for many years to come.""These creatures are so important to the culture and biodiversity of Solomon Islands and the Pacific region,"" Stewart said.Solomon Islands will host this year's Pacific Games between November 19 and December 2.","Animals and Nature, Conservation, Endangered and Protected Species, Environment, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Sport, Vanuatu, ",2023-02-03T02:23:21+00:00

43,https://www.abc.net.au/news/backstory/2022-12-03/australia-calling-radio-australia-83-years-broadcasting/101712052,"This is the story of one of the ABC's best kept secrets.ABC Radio Australia was never intended to be a great secret. It was just the nature of the service that few Australians knew about it. When I hosted its breakfast program for nine years, I could count on one hand the number of people who knew what I was talking about when I told them I worked for RA.Most people mistakenly thought it was the same thing as Radio National. I would have to explain, yet again, that this was our version of the BBC World Service, a worldwide broadcaster.RA was founded at the start of the World War II by prime minister Robert Menzies as an antidote to the disinformation being broadcast by Australia's new enemies, Germany and Russia. The idea of Australia Calling, as the service was initially named, was to provide an antidote to this propaganda, to counter that aerial bilge with factual, balanced and fair reportage.So with a small team of English, Spanish, Dutch and French broadcasters, a minuscule budget and some tiny transmitters in antiquated shacks in Victoria and New South Wales, Australia joined the short-wave age in December 1939.Despite the low power, Menzies's words were heard across the world:""The time has come for us to speak for ourselves.""These 10 words led Australia into a new era. At that time, Menzies was an avowed Britophile, whose government had, only two months before, followed Britain into a world war. Now we were demanding our own voice.This demand for independence would escalate. Within a few years, Australia would displease Winston Churchill by choosing to form close ties with the United States.During those war years, the battle for the minds and morale of Australians intensified. The axis powers' propaganda became more hysterical, claiming, among other things, that a Japanese armada was assembled to Australia's north, about to invade.In challenging this propaganda, the Australia Calling broadcasts had to straddle an ethical razor blade. For example, the network deliberately chose not to broadcast news of the deaths of soldiers when Japanese midget subs attacked Sydney Harbour in 1942. Nor did it broadcast information about looting by Australian servicemen after the Darwin bombings. The broadcaster believed these stories would be disheartening for Australians listening in occupied territories to the north. This wartime self-censorship may have had the best intentions, but imagine the danger to the service's credibility if these excisions were discovered.As the war progressed, more language services were added and plans began for a large transmitter to replace the shacks. Shepparton in Victoria was chosen to house the massive array that could send strong short-wave signals right across the world. When these transmitters were opened in 1945, they were so strong that they were used in the immediate post-war period by then-immigration minister Arthur Calwell to reach into Western Europe as a publicity tool for his post-war immigration scheme.So strong were Shepparton's transmitters that in 1948 they were used, successfully, to test whether radio waves could reach the Moon and bounce back to Earth. Although shortwave was not used when the Apollo missions eventually shot for the Moon, Shepparton proved that space was not a communication black hole. RA had played its part on the race to the Moon.Despite these success stories, the newly renamed Radio Australia had become perceived by the opposition to be so much of a tool in the Chifley Labor government that when the conservatives returned to power in 1949, the service's founding father Menzies planned to shut RA down. But in one of the most intriguing chapters in RA's history, the British Secret Service MI5 made an official protest, claiming the powerful Shepparton transmitters were central tools in information dissemination behind the new Iron Curtain. Menzies reversed his closure decision.RA now began one of its heydays, changing from a government-operated service to an international broadcaster, not dissimilar to the BBC's own short-wave service. The audiences appreciated its work. In the early 1950s it came second in a poll of world short-wave listeners. Surveys throughout the 50s still regularly had RA at the or near the top of the popularity polling, tag-teaming with the much more heavily resourced BBC for top position. And the letters from listeners almost filled rooms at RA's small offices in Melbourne.In the 1960s, war would again feature in RA's story. Australian soldiers were being sent to Vietnam, and RA provided news and entertainment succour to the soldiers. Presenter Margaret Wood was particularly popular, becoming known as ""the serviceman's friend"". More women were being heard elsewhere on RA: Jocelyn Terry began hosting specialist shows for Antarctica, and Desley Blanch presented music request programs.In the 1970s RA's journalism expanded. A tranche of young newspaper journalists were hired to form the service's first specialist reporting bureau. From this small start, Sue McCallister, Geoff Heriot and Graeme Dobell went on to have distinguished careers in international broadcasting. They were soon joined by journalist Sean Dorney who would become a household name in the Pacific.The language services would expand too, with Indonesian journalists Nuim Khaiyath and Hidayat Djajamihardja for the Bahasa service and Warium Benson and Caroline Tiriman for the PNG Tok Pisin broadcasts.Their local knowledge and contacts turned RA into a news gatherer that matured Australia's knowledge of these reporters' home countries. It wasn't without danger, however. Djajamihardja was only one of many journos to risk their lives for a story during the brittle Timor Lesté independence struggle. He was nearly killed by a rock thrown though his car window. He was then dragged out, and a gun was pointed at him as the guerrillas chanted: ""Kill him, kill him."" To this day, Djajamihardja does not know why he was not killed.After the turn of the century, RA would have the biggest change in its history. Chief executive Jean Gabriel Manguy set up an ambitious network of FM transmitters across the region, a network that would eventually replace the ageing short-wave technology. A push into Asia also started. My program, The Breakfast Club, was hired to be a specialist flow program for Asia in late 2005, and Malaysian television journalist Sen Lam hosted the new Connect Asia current affairs program. Manguy pushed us into critical Asian markets where we could not get an FM licence by organising live simulcasts with sister stations in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, and Malaysia, giving RA a potential reach in the billions.For the Pacific, Isabelle Genoux fronted the cultural program In The Loop. Genoux remembers money was tight, and on one outside broadcast she had to work virtually solo from a hastily built shed in Vanuatu.The existing Pacific current affairs program, Pacific Beat, was tweaked to be FM friendly, with more live content aimed at listeners driving to work.The live-flow program format meant that when a major event occurred in our region, we were able to cover it as it happened. When an attack was made on the lives of Timor Lesté's president and prime minister, Jose Ramos-Horta and Xanana Gusmao, our program went live with the story for three hours after a listener alerted us by text.Around the same time, our Fiji FM transmitter was closed down by the Fiji government after we broadcasted criticism of Frank Bainimarama's coup junta. Our Fiji-based technician was forced at gunpoint to go through the jungle and turn off the diesel-operated transmitter. And this was where short wave came into its own. Short wave cannot be stopped locally, and so the good work of Pacific Beat and the other programs was still able to get to the ears of Fijian people who were wondering what was really happening in their country.Manguy's expansion was a highlight but there were many times when RA found itself vulnerable, particularly when governments changed. When John Howard became prime minister in 1996, RA was set to be shut down, but the last-minute intervention of then-foreign minister Alexander Downer got the decision reversed. Nearly 20 years on from that, RA had a big funding cut that saw the axing of many programs, including mine, and the redundancies of dozens of long-running staff.Then in 2017 the last link to 1939, short wave, was abandoned. Long-time RA technician Nigel Holmes switched off RA at the Shepparton transmitter.RA's focus now became online and FM in the Pacific, Papua New Guinea and Timor Lesté, placing RA in an important place as the Australian government started its so-called Pacific Pivot, which broadened its international policy to its Pacific neighbours. This was timely with the shifting geopolitics of the region, which included China attempting to increase its influence with countries such as Solomon Islands who faced the vulnerabilities caused by climate change, a world economic downturn, security fluctuations and pandemics.As I write this, things appear to be on an upswing once more for RA. Throughout 2021 and into 2022, the ABC had been lobbying both government and opposition about the need for additional funding for the ABC's international activities given the rapidly evolving geostrategic landscape of the region. In the latest budget, the ABC has received $32 million over four years for its work internationally. There are plans for an increased number of transmitter sites for ABC Radio Australia in the Pacific and an expansion of programs created for, with and about Pacific peoples.RA has come a long way in its 83 years. The trip has never been easy; it certainly has not been linear and, in some ways, it has had to operate through changing geopolitics almost every decade while still maintaining the ABC's independence. It's been a rollercoaster, but RA is still there. And history tells us it has the stamina to stay there.Dr Phil Kafcaloudes is a former Radio Australia presenter and was commissioned by the ABC to write the history of the service. Australia Calling: The ABC Radio Australia Story is available online at Booktopia.","ABC, Asia, Australia, Journalism, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Radio Broadcasting, Shepparton, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, ",2022-12-02T21:30:36+00:00

The AFP only began to gradually rearm Solomon Islands police from 2013.A contingent of Solomon Islands police officers were trained with the MK18s in Brisbane earlier this year, and conducted live-fire drills in July.On social media, Australia's High Commissioner to Solomon Islands, Lachlan Strahan, stressed that the firearms came with ""stringent training and rigorous safeguards, including concerning safe and secure storage"".The weapons will only by used by the RSIPF's elite Police Response Team, and will not be available to regular officers, who do not carry firearms.The AFP has also stressed the agreement to provide these new firearms formally occurred during the development of the RSIPF AFP Policing Partnership Program, which commenced in July 2021.That's several months before China started its own cooperation program with Solomon Islands police, in December of that year.However, Dr Anna Powles — from Massey University in New Zealand — said that handing over semi-automatic rifles still represented a ""step change in the types of weapons provided under the Australian-Solomon Islands policing partnership"".""China donated 95 replica assault weapons to the RSIPF to train with earlier this year — presumably, with the intent of supplying actual weapons or converting the replicas,"" she told the ABC.""The influx of weapons into Solomons raises concerns about the number of weapons in Solomon Islands and the risk of theft from the police armouries.""We now have a situation where two competing security stakeholders are arming units within the RSIPF.""Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare heaped praise on the donation at a ceremony this morning, declaring that ""robust security"" was necessary for ""investor confidence"" in his country.Honiara was once again rocked with violence in November last year when anti-government protests devolved into rioting and looting.Australia, once again, sent in a contingent of troops and police to restore order, and a small contingent will remain in the capital until just after the Pacific Games next year.Mr Sogavare has repeatedly cited the riots — and the substantial damage they did to Solomon Islands' economy — as one of the reasons why his country needed to turn to China for additional security assistance.He told the handover ceremony this morning that it was crucial for police in Solomon Islands to be equipped properly so they could be given the appropriate ""trust"" and ""respect"".""I am emphasising the need for an equipped police force is paramount, not only for security but also for social economic growth,"" he said.""Law and order is an enabler to development and it is important, as a sovereign state, we are able to better protect ourselves, deliver on our security mandates and confront any threat when it comes.""","Australia, China, Defence and National Security, Foreign Affairs, Pacific, Police, Solomon Islands, Unrest, Conflict and War, World Politics, ",2022-11-02T06:49:55+00:00

Are you kidding? Look at him, he's a nobody,"" he said at the time. ""He's not even a minister and he's demanding to be recognised and to speak before the prime minister of Tuvalu. Is he crazy?""Mr Waqa even threatened to take the matter to the United Nations, saying that China was trying to bully and ""dictate"" to countries in the Pacific. He created more headlines at the same meeting when he serenaded New Zealand's then-prime minister Jacinda Ardern with a song.The former Nauru president has also been enveloped in multiple controversies surrounding Australia's deeply contentious offshore detention processing facility on the island. Activists also accused Mr Waqa's government of undermining media freedoms and basic civil liberties in Nauru in the wake of the trial of the so-called Nauru 19 protest group.The meeting came against a backdrop of intensifying competition between the United States and China in the Pacific.Both great powers have recently appointed special envoys for the region, while Micronesian leaders earlier this month flagged a likely visit to the region by US President Joe Biden.Pacific leaders also discussed building stronger ties with Washington, potentially by establishing a new ""Special Envoy"" office in the US, which would give the Forum Secretariat better access to both the US government and the United Nations in New York. Fiji's Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka — who was instrumental in bringing Kiribati back into the organisation after travelling to the country in June to meet President Taneti Maamau — said he gave a clear message to fellow Pacific leaders during the meeting.""Now we're back together, please don't disrupt it again,"" he said.  The next PIF leaders meeting will be held later this year in Cook Islands.","China, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Nauru, Pacific, Solomon Islands, United States, World Politics, ",2023-02-24T06:59:22+00:00

But I would not be surprised if that is the case,"" Dr Kabutaulaka said.Tess Newton Cain, project lead at the Griffith Asia Institute's Pacific Hub, said it would be naive to believe the US was not influencing Guam's PIF push.""From the US point of view, given their avowed intention to be much more engaged in the region, they would see it as very beneficial,"" she said.""You're able to sit at that top table, if you like.""Guam's desire to join the PIF is likely to cause a stir among Pacific nations.Established in 1971 with the goal of enhancing regional cooperation, the forum was originally comprised only of independent Pacific nations.""I think it's important to remember that decolonisation in the Pacific was a founding principle for the establishment of the Pacific Islands Forum,"" Dr Newton Cain said.""There would be a question to be asked about whether allowing Guam to become a full member is in full alignment with that.""But Dr Newton Cain also pointed to a precedent set when the French territories of New Caledonia and French Polynesia were granted PIF membership in 2016.The decision was made partly on the basis that both territories had made significant steps towards gaining independence and were registered on the United Nations decolonisation list at the time.While Guam's Indigenous Chamorro people have campaigned for independence from the United States, the movement is not as formalised.""I'm not aware of any kind of pathway that's in place,"" Dr Newton Cain said.Mr Tenorio said it would be inconceivable to deny Guam's inclusion.""What would the difference be?"" he asked.""Guam has one non-voting delegate to the United States House of Representatives. So we even have less direct involvement in the national affairs of the United States.""He said Guam had received a ""tremendous amount of support"" from Pacific leaders when discussing its desire to join the forum.Federated States of Micronesia President David Panuelo said Guam's potential membership of PIF was a conversation well worth having.""Although often seen by outsiders as purely a territory or component unit of the United States, Guam – in a manner not dissimilar to New Caledonia and French Polynesia, or Niue and Cook Islands – is a self-governing Pacific Island,"" he told ABC.Mr Panuelo noted that Guam was already a member of other Pacific agencies, including the Pacific Island Development Program and the Pacific Community.""The Federated States of Micronesia understands and respects Guam's position and interest to join the Pacific Islands Forum,"" he said.Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs said it was aware of Guam's interest in joining the forum.New Zealand's Foreign Ministry said any decisions on membership of the PIF would need to be made by forum leaders on the basis of consensus.Other Pacific nations, including Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea have not responded to the ABC's requests for comment.Guam's bid to join the PIF comes at a tumultuous time for the regional body.Earlier this year, Kiribati announced its decision to leave the body after a year-long leadership dispute involving Micronesian countries.Dr Kabutaulaka said the dispute over Guam's inclusion could further destabilise the PIF.""Pacific Island countries might say 'our premier political organisation … is now being taken over by powers, such as the US, France, and therefore it is no longer worth being a member',"" Dr Kabutaulaka said.""I think with the current geopolitical discussions and competition that's taking place, some Pacific Island countries will push back on this.""He said there was potential for other US territories in the Pacific, including American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands, to follow Guam's lead and also apply for PIF membership.Dr Newton Cain pointed to potential governance issues.As an unincorporated US territory, Guam does not have the ability to exercise its own foreign policy and may not be able to sign treaties and agreements central to the PIF.""The more we have these members that … don't necessarily have the requisite amount of power to fully participate, then it can make things very complicated."" Dr Newton Cain said.She said the possible storage of nuclear weapons on Guam would be at odds with anti-nuclear proliferation pacts signed by PIF members.""Whether there are or are not nuclear weapons on Guam is not something that gets talked about in public,"" she said.""But I think there would certainly be some concern that having Guam as a member could cause problems on that score.""Issues may also arise from a pending review of the PIF's regional architecture.Solomon Islands cited the review when announcing an intention to hold off on signing a joint declaration with the US last month, although it did eventually endorse the pact.Soli Middleby, a former Australian diplomat to the Pacific, said Pacific leaders may want to complete the review before considering Guam's request to join the forum.""A lot of these questions around membership, how you engage, what the right set up for the Pacific Islands Forum should be fleshed out and discussed within that process,"" she said.""I think these things are always contentious.

They were almost [as active] as the Solomon Islands government itself,"" he said.Mr Johnson said analysis of comments on Solomon Islands social media found ""a strong correlation with a decline in anti-China sentiment and a rise in anti-West sentiment"" after the coordinated information campaigns.For example, after Honiara exploded in riots last November, Chinese officials and state media started to accuse ""outside forces"" of cultivating the unrest, suggesting the US and Taiwan deliberately inflamed tensions or sponsored the rioters in order to stoke tension between Beijing and Honiara.Before this campaign, three in four Facebook comments on this subject were critical of China, but that figure dropped down to 57 per cent over the following weeks.Negative comments about the West ticked up slightly, but were still only 7 per cent of the total.A similar dynamic emerged when Chinese officials and state media outlets accused the West of ""interference"" and ""bullying"", after the US and Australia criticised the China-Solomon Islands security agreement.Both Canberra and Washington are anxious that China might use the agreement to establish a military presence in Solomon Islands, although Honiara has repeatedly denied that will ever happen.The ASPI report found that negative comments about China dropped from 49 per cent of the total to 29 per cent during this campaign, while positive comments about Beijing jumped sharply, from just 8 per cent of the total to 41 per cent.Critical comments about the West bounced up, from zero to 18 per cent.The report also found more than one-in-four negative comments about the US and Australia from Solomon Islands Facebook users echoed language found in Chinese state narratives, with many commentators accusing the West of ""threatening"", ""controlling"" or ""bullying"" Solomon Islands.Mr Johnson said it was unsurprising China would do everything possible to shape public opinion in Solomon Islands, and officials in Canberra should be aware of how state media was working to deliberately tarnish Australia's reputation.""It's not somehow unique or wrong that the Chinese Communist Party is engaging with media in Solomon Islands. If anything, I think the US and Australian diplomats should be engaging with the media at a similar level,"" he said.""The difference is the fact that, at times, they're engaging the media to spread clearly false narratives that have a clear objective that is damaging to Australia.""The report recommends the federal government should push back against these campaigns by supporting more research into foreign government disinformation in the Pacific, increasing the transparency of Australia's aid program, and working with other like-minded countries to expand Pacific Island journalist training.The ABC has approached the Chinese embassy in Solomon Islands for comment.","Australia, China, Foreign Affairs, Pacific, Social Media, Solomon Islands, United States, Unrest, Conflict and War, World Politics, ",2022-10-04T14:00:38+00:00

Human development went backwards due to the pandemic and Australia should be providing more support,"" Mr Purcell said.""In challenging economic and geostrategic times, an increase to ODA is critical. The needs of our regional partners are clear: investment in health systems strengthening, climate change adaptation, gender equality, economic livelihoods and social protections.""The Australian government has not yet spelled out how the additional money will be spent, and Mr Purcell said development bodies ""looked forward to seeing details of the additional funding on budget night"".In addition to the boost to aid spending, the government is promising to spend more money on a host of other Pacific initiatives.Around $46 million will be spent on funding the Australian Federal Police operations in Solomon Islands, where they are helping to maintain security in the wake of violent riots late last year.An additional $30 million will be spent boosting the region's aerial surveillance, while almost $19 million will be spent to establish a network of Australian Border Force officers across the PacificThe ABC will also get $32 million to expand ABC content and transmission across the region as the government becomes increasingly anxious about threats to media freedom across the Pacific.And the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific — set up by the former government to provide infrastructure loans and grants to Pacific Island nations — will also get another $500 million over the next decade.Minister for International Development Pat Conroy said the government was bringing ""new energy and resources"" to the Pacific which would help ""help build a stronger and more united Pacific family, and a more secure region"".In a statement, Shadow Foreign Minister Simon Birmingham said the opposition welcomed ""Labor's embrace of key Coalition programs to continue our Pacific Step Up that prioritises Australia's important relationship with our Pacific island family"". ""Naturally, we will want to see the detail sitting behind the government's announcement, especially how any new spending is paid for and what it comes at the expense of.""ABC","Australia, Federal Government, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, Pacific, Solomon Islands, ",2022-10-20T18:30:05+00:00

59,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-09-28/pacific-leaders-to-sign-11-point-declaration-with-united-states/101477194,"Solomon Islands has signalled it won't sign on to an 11-point declaration between the United States and Pacific Island nations this week, dealing a blow to the White House ahead of a high-profile presidential summit with Pacific leaders in Washington.The ABC has been told that Washington and Pacific Island countries have spent recent weeks negotiating a new joint statement on the partnership between the US and the Pacific states.The declaration is designed to provide a framework for intensified US engagement in the Pacific.Washington is moving to ramp up its diplomatic, development and commercial presence in the region, partly in response to China's growing influence in several Pacific nations.Some Pacific leaders have described the declaration as being ""similar"" in intent to a more sweeping trade and security deal which China unsuccessfully pursued with 10 Pacific Island nations in May.Washington's proposal covers issues including strengthening US-Pacific ties, tackling climate change, sustainable development, security and preserving the rules-based international order.Several Pacific nations are expecting to sign the declaration during the historic meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House on September 28 and 29.It's the first time Pacific nations have been invited to Washington for an in-person summit.However, several sources stressed that negotiations over the joint declaration are still ongoing.The ABC has also been told that Solomon Islands sent a diplomatic note to other Pacific Island nations on Monday, announcing it will not sign up to the declaration this week, and stressing there was no consensus over the document.The note also said Solomon Islands needed more time to reflect on the proposal, and that the declaration would have to be considered by its national parliament.The move is likely to consolidate anxieties in both Canberra and Washington about the trajectory of Solomon Islands under Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, who has repeatedly berated traditional partners including Australia and New Zealand, while drawing closer to China.Earlier this year Solomon Islands also signed a deeply controversial security pact with Beijing, although Mr Sogavare has repeatedly ruled out allowing China to establish a military presence in the country.It's not clear what impact Solomon Islands' decision to hold off on the declaration will have on negotiations over the text.Several other Pacific nations have welcomed increasing US engagement in the region, while also making it clear that it must be on their terms.Federated States of Micronesia President David Panuelo said there had been a ""very involved process"" to develop the document, which was initiated by the White House.""Our officials have been going back and forth with the United States,"" Mr Panuelo said.He said it focused on bolstering Pacific regionalism, tackling climate change, advancing economic growth, and supporting disaster preparation and response.It also includes addressing COVID-19 and other health concerns, responding to the legacies of war in the Pacific and promoting nuclear non-proliferation.Washington has been increasingly uneasy about the way China has expanded commercial and security links in the Pacific, suggesting it could undermine sovereignty across the region.Earlier this year, China sought a multilateral trade and security deal with 10 Pacific nations, but this was shelved at a meeting between Beijing and Pacific leaders in May.Samoan Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa said the agreements were similar in intent, but added that the US had been more willing to negotiate with the Pacific as a whole.Initially, only Pacific countries that had formal diplomatic ties with the US were invited to this week's summit, which excluded Cook Islands, Niue, New Caledonia or French Polynesia.However the invitation was extended to those countries and territories, as well as Australia and New Zealand, after lobbying from Pacific Island leaders.""We've been insisting that if partners wish to talk to us, collectively, then they need to do it through the modalities of the Pacific [Islands] Forum,"" Fiame said.""When the Chinese were proposing something similar, we were giving them that message, but it didn't seem to filter through or they weren't willing to take that on board.""Fiame said the declaration between Pacific countries and the US was ""pretty general"" and prioritised climate change, which is seen as the region's biggest security threat.She said there were also significant discussions about maritime security.""Not only the protection of the fisheries, but also the maritime boundaries,"" she said.The Samoan prime minister pressed the importance of maintaining peace in the region, and said she would not like to see increased US military

encourage that in any way.""Other nations are pushing for more economic investment from the US.""Our biggest investment partner right now is China … it shouldn't be that way,"" said Palau President Surangel Whipps Junior. ""We don't even have diplomatic relations with China. But the number one investors are coming from China.

Three typhoons in the last 10 years, which we never had before.""Every time we tried to dig ourselves out of the hole, we've got problems with climate change that send us backwards.""Mr Whipps said he hoped the meeting with Mr Biden would be ""more than just a photo opportunity at the White House"".""I hope it's substantial programs and initiatives that really build that partnership,"" he said.Director of the Lowy Institute's Pacific Islands Program Meg Keen agreed the US summit with Pacific leaders was very significant, but must lead to real outcomes.""The signing of the declaration is important because it's a signal. But more important is what actually gets delivered over time,"" Dr Keen said.""There have been promises, in fact, on a number of these types of topics in the past, and there hasn't been strong delivery.""She said it was encouraging to see US open embassies in Pacific Island nations, including Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Tonga.But she said financing promises made in this week's summit would be a challenge for Washington.""Those commitments have to be translated into action, and that needs financing, and the financing has to go to Congress and it has to be approved,"" she said.""There can be quite a lag time between the provenance and the delivery.""Dr Keen said there were key differences between the US-Pacific declaration and China's proposed trade and security deal with the region.""There's some overlap, and we can see that in climate change, economic development, and so on,"" she said.""I think what the United States is trying to show is a strong commitment to development, and they're trying to pull back on security.""The regional proposal with the Pacific [and China] … had a much stronger security element to it.""","China, Foreign Affairs, Kiribati, New Zealand, Pacific, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Treaties and Alliances, United States, World Politics, ",2022-09-27T18:44:32+00:00

declaration, vowing to strengthen ties amid growing concerns of China's role in the region.The US managed to secure support from all 14 Pacific island states attending a two-day summit in Washington DC, despite an initial refusal from Solomon Islands.""Pacific leaders welcome the United States's commitment to enhance its engagement, including by expanding its diplomatic presence, the ties between our peoples, and US development cooperation across the region,"" the declaration, released by the White House, said.The 11-point, Declaration on US-Pacific Partnership, was intensely negotiated.It had initially been described by some Pacific nations as ""similar"" to the trade and security deal China unsuccessfully pursued with 10 nations in May.The declaration provides a framework for intensified US engagement in the Pacific, including commitments to tackling climate change, advancing economic growth, and bolstering Pacific regionalism.The statement also acknowledged the importance of international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on freedom of navigation and overflight.Solomon Islands last month put a moratorium on foreign navies making port calls, raising concerns in this area among the United States and its allies.Since signing a deeply controversial security pact with Beijing earlier this year, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has repeatedly berated traditional partners including Australia and New Zealand, while drawing closer to China.The country signalled it would not sign the declaration during the summit, saying it needed more time to reflect on the proposal and that it would have considered by its national parliament.However, Mr Sogavare has now endorsed the declaration and was even photographed posing shoulder-to-shoulder with the US President. Earlier, President Joe Biden's administration also announced a slew of new programs to substantially broaden the United States' presence in the Pacific.The US has promised to expand police training, sign new defence pacts, boost investment in the region, ramp up development initiatives and plough more than $75 million into helping Pacific economies recover from the COVID pandemic.The US will also move to extend full diplomatic recognition to New Zealand's two associated states in the Pacific — Cook Islands and Niue — in another sign it wants to expand its influence in the South Pacific.The strategy promises to ""elevate broader and deeper engagement with the Pacific Islands as a priority of US foreign policy"" to help the region fight climate change and other pressing challenges.It also explicitly links the US strategy to China's growing presence in the region, warning that ""pressure and economic coercion by the People's Republic of China"" risks ""undermining the peace, prosperity, and security of the region, and by extension, of the United States"".The White House said the announcements amount to more than $US810 million ($1.25 billion) in expanded programs – although that figure includes $US600 million for fisheries assistance over a decade already pledged by Vice-President Kamala Harris at the Pacific Islands Forum earlier this year.The new US announcements cover a wide array of different programs and initiatives, both new and existing, although the funding packages offered are sometimes modest.The US has confirmed it will expand the footprint of USAID in the region, opening a regional mission in Fiji's capital within 12 months and opening a new office in Papua New Guinea.It has also chosen former Ambassador to Fiji Frankie Reed as its first-ever US Envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum.There's also a strong focus on security cooperation.The administration said it will provide extra funding to enhance US Coast Guard training in the Pacific, as well sending Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents to Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands to provide law-enforcement training.Australia has long been Solomon Islands' main security partner, but China has recently made significant gains in the country, signing a contentious pact and beginning a police training program for local forces.The US also said it was pursuing a defence logistics and supply agreement with Fiji, and will soon begin negotiating a defence cooperation agreement with Papua New Guinea.Anna Powles from Massey University said some of the new announcements showed how security cooperation was a ""key pillar"" of US engagement in the Pacific.""This is reflected in the reference to an increased defence presence in the Pacific, negotiating a defence cooperation agreement with PNG, and the new [defence pact] with Fiji as well as law-enforcement training by the FBI,"" she said.""The US strategy calls out China as a source of geopolitical pressure and economic coercion felt by PIF member states and makes a direct link between Chinese actions undermining peace and security in the region and the US's own security.""Good intentions aside, this is the call to arms that is driving US engagement.""The United States has also announced a raft of climate, education, investment and infrastructure initiatives.It will establish a new fellowship program for emerging Pacific leaders, send Peace Corp volunteers to Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Tonga after a long absence, and develop a new agreement to encourage US private sector in key Pacific Island infrastructure projects.In addition, it will plough another $US18 million into a major program to expand electrification through Papua New Guinea.The Biden Administration has also promised more than $US130 million to help Pacific nations tackle climate challenges and leverage financing to help build resilience, predicting it could draw in $US400 million in private capital.Tess Newton Cain from the Griffith Asia Institute's Pacific Hub said the initiatives demonstrated the strength of US intent in the region, but warned that the program could quickly falter if it didn't draw on local expertise and priorities.""The Americans want to move with breakneck speed but the elephant in the room is the question of coordination and coherence across agencies,"" she said.""There are a few references to this being demand led, but the overall tone is one of this being supply led. There's not enough understanding of what's already happening, and especially what is being developed through local leadership.""Dr Powles said the Biden Administration was intent on locking in its Pacific strategy and tackling its key priorities in the region ahead of approaching US House and Senate elections.""There's clearly a desire to move fast and bed down commitments quickly. The tempo may slow down in the lead up to November midterm elections and afterwards,"" she said.""But it is less clear how the US system will deliver the strategy; including building the infrastructure to do this, and that's where it could fall down.""If you aren't building Pacific knowledge and expertise then you'll hit problems. It's that coordination piece which is missing in Washington.""","China, Climate Change, Foreign Affairs, Kiribati, National Security, New Zealand, Pacific, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Treaties and Alliances, United States, World Politics, ",2022-09-29T19:20:54+00:00

That's the fundamental problem with this bill. This alone should have given [the government] pause.""Earlier, Mr Sogavare mocked Australia while declaring he will take up the government's offer to help fund the next national election – but only after his country had voted to push it back.Mr Sogavare on Thursday repeated his attack on Australia's offer to fund elections scheduled for next year, telling parliament he still saw it as ""an attempt to directly interfere in our domestic affairs"".The offer came in the middle of an acrimonious parliamentary debate over the delay, with the opposition accusing Mr Sogavare of searching for excuses to hold onto power.The Prime Minister told parliament he would accept Australia's offer, but his government remained determined to delay the poll until after the Pacific Games in November next year.""If this bill is passed then we look forward to Australia's offer to assist us in funding the pre-requisite electoral reforms and the conduct of the national elections,"" Mr Sogavare declared earlier on Thursday.""They've offered now, so you get ready, brother, to fund the costs. It's a big cost, Mr Speaker, the Electoral Commission needs a lot of money.""So you offer, you must prepare to give the money that you said you want to offer us, Mr Speaker!""Foreign Minister Penny Wong on Wednesday denied that Australia was trying to interfere in Solomon Islands politics by offering to help fund the elections, stressing that the assistance would be available for a poll in either 2023 or 2024.The federal opposition has also ramped up its criticism of the government's handling of the election funding offer, with Shadow Foreign Minister Simon Birmingham accusing Labor of making tactical missteps.""The handling of this funding offer to the Solomon Islands has, at best, been cack-handed,"" he said.""By acting too late, making the offer public without basic courtesies of forewarning and their lack of response to the Solomon Islands' subsequent concerns, the Albanese government has made a difficult situation worse.""The debate had been called with less than a week's notice, with the Prime Minister dodging a parliamentary committee hearing where opposition MPs and civil society groups could weigh in on the bill.Security was increased and businesses were shuttered in the capital Honiara on Thursday with fears the debate could stoke fresh instability in the Pacific Islands country.Solomon Islands resident Millicent Barty, who considers herself a social activist, was concerned by the lack of public consultation and dialogue.She is discouraged by the state of democracy in the country, saying it has become ""messy"" and people are confused. ""We see that the bond between people and their representatives has over time just been breaking down,"" she said. ""I feel that people don't believe that participation is worth the effort. Or that their vote actually mattered or matters.""It's come to a point where a majority will just say, you know, 'why bother?'""She was also ""shocked"" that the Pacific Games would take priority over the national election.""It will only run for two weeks and it's prioritised above our democratic rights,"" she said. Solomon Islands Business Magazine publisher Robert Iroga said Solomon Islanders have been opposed to the idea to extend parliament since it was first announced.""The Solomons Christian Association is basically opposed to an extension, then we have the Chamber of Commerce where 70 per cent don't support any extensions,"" he said.""And based on what is coming out of social media, [there] is basically widespread opposition to the proposed amendments.""Mr Iroga welcomed Australia's offer to fund the elections and did not see it as interference. Ms Barty agreed that support was needed and thought that the language used by the government in response to Australia was ""a bit far-fetched"".""In cases where we need to defend democracy and uphold the principles of democracy, I actually feel we need international support,"" she said. The bill continues Solomon Islands' run of making news headlines for its political moves.It comes after the country controversially signed a security pact with China earlier this year and ordered the national broadcaster SIBC not to report content criticising the government.Mr Iroga has been following Mr Sogavare's career since the 1990s and said he has definitely recognised a shift. ""I think a lot of people would link him to the kind of leaders he associates himself with now,"" he said. ""I have noticed Sogavare has really changed in the last few years as leader, and he's been very strong with the anti-sentiments on the Western governments like Australia.""","Australia, Elections, Foreign Affairs, Pacific, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-09-08T06:46:02+00:00

I would reiterate the standing offer the Australian government has to support Solomon Islands' next election, whether held in 2023 or 2024,"" she said.""Obviously, as I've made clear publicly, the timing of the election is entirely a matter for the government and the parliament of Solomon Islands,"" she said.The Solomon Islands parliament is due to formally debate the constitutional amendment to delay elections when it sits on Thursday.Mr Sogavare's government has control of the chamber and most observers expect the parliament to pass it rapidly.The often mercurial Prime Minister Sogavare said Australia's decision to tell the media about the funding offer in the middle of the Solomon's parliamentary debate proved it was intent on shaping the outcome.But Senator Wong suggested the government only made the information public because it fielded questions from journalists.""This government does seek to transparently answer questions which are made by journalists,"" she told the senate.""We did so in relation to an offer which is consistent with the practice of past and this government to support democracy.""The foreign minister did not confirm that the government first made the formal offer to Solomon Islands only last week, saying only that the offer had been ""reiterated on more than one occasion, including by Minister Conroy as well as by officials"".And the opposition is maintaining its attack on the government over the issue, with Senator Birmingham accusing the Foreign Minister of ""ducking and weaving important questions"".""It appears the Albanese government has blundered this offer and made a difficult situation worse through its poor public handling of the matter,"" he said in a statement.""Given the many pre-election statements by Labor, it is now remarkable that they are refusing to be transparent in the circumstances leading to an outcome that has resulted in a Pacific region partner issuing an extraordinary rebuke to the Albanese government.""","Australia, Elections, Federal Government, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, Politics and Government, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-09-07T09:45:08+00:00

countries condemns Russia's invasion of Ukraine, flags intensifying American security cooperation with the region and declares climate change is the ""highest priority"" and ""single greatest existential threat"" to the Pacific.However, Pacific nations appear to have stripped away a section which seems to take aim at the contentious security agreement signed by China and Solomon Islands, deleting a reference to the need for Pacific Island states to ""consult with one another closely on security decisions with regional impacts"".Leaders from 12 Pacific Island countries are set to join US President Joe Biden and a string of top US officials at a high-profile summit in Washington DC over the next two days.It's the first time such a large group of Pacific Island leaders have been hosted at the White House, and the US is flagging it will make ""substantial"" new announcements ramping up its regional diplomatic, commercial and development initiatives.The Biden administration has also flagged it will launch its new Pacific strategy in the coming days to ensure all US government agencies are working together effectively in the region.The joint statement being negotiated by the US and the Pacific for the summit spans a wide range of topics, including climate change, security, illegal fishing, the legacy of nuclear testing and the economic recovery from COVID-19.Solomon Islands has already flagged it will not join the declaration this week, saying it needs more time to consider the document.Multiple Pacific Island government sources also stressed negotiations were still ongoing, and the document was likely to change further ahead of the summit.Some Pacific leaders have compared the US declaration to China’s proposal for a sweeping, detailed trade and security deal with the Pacific, which leaders rejected earlier this year.The draft version seen by the ABC largely focuses on laying out the principles and broader framework for intensified US engagement in the Pacific.The declaration opens by saying the US and Pacific Island countries ""recommit to working together in genuine partnership"" to tackle ""mounting challenges"" including a ""worsening climate crisis and an increasing complex geopolitical environment.""The draft also says Pacific leaders welcome the US commitment to ""expand its diplomatic presence and development cooperation"" in the region.On climate change, the declaration urges all countries and major emitters to ramp up ambition to ensure their planned cuts to emissions align with the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.It reiterates that climate change is the ""single greatest existential threat to the livelihoods, security … and wellbeing"" of the Pacific and urges developed countries to ramp up climate finance to meet the 100 billion target to help developing countries deal with the impact of climate change.The section on security has already been edited several times, with one source telling the ABC the negotiations over wording had been long and protracted because the subject was so sensitive.The draft seen by the ABC condemns ""Russia's brutal war against Ukraine"" and calls for Moscow to withdraw, although that section is still being negotiated, with Solomon Islands pushing for weaker language to be used.There's also a reference to maintaining peace in stability ""in the Indo-Pacific, including across the Taiwan Strait"" – although some close observers predict that reference may be deleted in the final version.The draft commits to deepening US economic engagement in the Pacific, saying Washington will support ""infrastructure, transportation, connectivity, cyber security capacities and digital infrastructure.""It also commits to intensifying efforts to improve maritime security, curb plastic pollution and fight illegal fishing.Earlier this year Vice-President Kamala Harris announced the US would boost economic assistance to the Forum Fisheries Agency, as well as opening new embassies in Tonga and Kiribati while relaunching the Peace Corps in the Pacific.A senior administration official told journalists that the White House summit was ""unprecedented"" and signalled the US government's determination to lift its game in the Pacific.""The president and secretary of state will be basically unveiling … substantial new initiatives, new funding that will affect every element of government purpose from our compact negotiations to the Peace Corps to USAID,"" they said.The senior official said the Pacific's ""demand signal"" for greater US involvement in the region was ""louder and clearer than it ever has been"".""The United States is a responsible country and understands that the need for deeper, more sustained American engagement.""The senior official also declined to comment directly on the decision by Solomon Islands not to join the declaration, saying simply that the US was ""patient and fully committed to working in close consultation with Pacific Island nations on the issues that we both think are critical going forward.""Dr Anna Powles from Massey University told the ABC the draft declaration ""reveals Washington's desire to move fast and decisively in the Pacific"" but said the US ""needs to be careful not to leave the region behind.""""The draft declaration is revealing in what it tells us about the constraints and limits of US engagement and action as well as the clear position that Pacific countries are taking with respect to Forum centrality and their 'red lines' when it comes to climate change and the sovereignty and national interest of member states,"" she said.","China, Foreign Affairs, Kiribati, New Zealand, Pacific, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Treaties and Alliances, United States, World Politics,

It has exposed Sogavare and his government's … selfish agenda to hold on to power,"" he told the ABC.""We do not agree that Australia's offer amounts to foreign influence. When Australia gave $17 million for the Pacific Games it was heartily welcomed with smiles. But when an offer is made to support timely elections, it is seen differently.""This simply highlights the schizophrenic nature of Sogavare's relationship with Australia. He will take what he feels is good for him and will brand an offer to help uphold our own constitution as foreign influence.""Australia has offered logistical and financial assistance for several recent elections, including the most recent contest in 2019.The government has contributed $700,000 through the Australian Electoral Commission, as well as $5 million channelled through a United Nations initiative designed to strengthen electoral processes through to 2024.But this offer makes it clear that Australia is willing to make a larger contribution over and above that to help Solomon Islands hold elections next year.""If the election remains in 2023, we will support Solomon Islands to ensure it can successfully occur,"" a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said.Still, the Foreign Minister and Australian diplomats are treading carefully.The election deferral is politically charged in Solomon Islands and some of Mr Sogavare's supporters have already taken to social media in the country accusing Australia of meddling in domestic politics.The opposition says the Prime Minister remains intent on rushing the constitutional amendment through as quickly as possible, and are angry they won't get a chance to scrutinise the bill in the Bills and Legislation Committee.The MP chairing the committee, John Maneniaru, lashed the process in parliament this morning, accusing the government of trashing democratic conventions.""I am very disheartened, very disappointed indeed, by the fact the Prime Minister and [his party] have seen it fit [and] decided to hijack my Bills and Legislation Committee mandate and parliamentary responsibility,"" he said.""This for me is a sad moment indeed … for our democracy.

This is hypocrisy at its best.""The ABC has been told that Solomon Islands may now seek to introduce new restrictions on overseas journalists, potentially making it more difficult for reporters who have aired stories critical of the government to enter the country.Mr Sogavare's government has also been exploring the idea of setting up a new state-run newspaper, although it's not clear how far advanced this plan is.But the prospect has still fuelled unease and concern among Solomon Islands media outlets, which often rely quite heavily on government advertising for revenue.If the government ran those advertisements in its own newspaper instead it could deliver a heavy blow to the finances of existing media organisations.Senior Solomon Islands journalist Georgina Kekea told the ABC that rumours about a government-run newspaper had been circulating since last year.""The government should focus on creating a conducive environment for the private media sector, rather than coming and competing with the private sector,"" she said.""We have had comments from [the government] saying that papers refuse to run press releases and most times their stories are in the middle pages.

It's just another waste of money.""One Australian government source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the ABC that the space for media freedom in Solomon Islands looked to be ""narrowing"" and that Australian officials were watching developments very closely.Separately, a DFAT spokesperson responded to questions about the developments with a broader statement about the importance of a free press.""Australia's view is long-standing and consistent – free and independent media is vital to building strong communities and ensuring democratic accountability worldwide,"" they said.""Australia supports a diverse, independent and professional Pacific media sector.""","Australia, China, Foreign Aid, Media Industry, Pacific, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-08-22T03:06:43+00:00

I have some concerns about their ability to do that,"" she said.Some opposition MPs and civil society groups in Solomon Islands have also raised concerns about the deal, saying the bidding process has been mired in secrecy, and questioning whether there's a real need to build quite so many new towers across the country.The Australian government said it was ""aware"" of the deal but stressed that development decisions were a ""matter for the Solomon Islands government"", a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said.""Australia supports infrastructure investment that is transparent and open, meets genuine needs, delivers long-term benefits and avoids unsustainable debt burdens,"" the spokesperson said.Australia is separately constructing six telecommunications towers across three separate provinces in the country at the request of the Solomon Islands government.","Australia, China, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Internet, Mobile Phones, Mobile and Internet Access, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Telecommunications Services Industry, World Politics, ",2022-08-18T05:19:11+00:00

We're living at a time when finding out what's actually going on in this fast-changing world means you may be better off listening to military chiefs than political leaders.General Mark Milley, America's highest-ranking military officer, and Angus Houston, the former head of the Australian Defence Force, offer two recent examples.Both addressed what many politicians think but don't verbalise: Both were speaking about the dramatic rise of China.General Milley addressed questions about whether Australia would join the US in any war with China.When he was interviewed on ABC's 7.30, host Sarah Ferguson asked General Milley how much damage could be done to the US-Australia alliance if Australia said 'No' to the US in the event of a war in Asia.""The United States and Australia have been key allies ever since World War I, so well over 100 years and we've been shoulder to shoulder, and I think both of our countries share similar values,"" General Milley replied.""We have similar outlooks and we have similar policies. So, I would think that, if something occurred in the future, Australia and the United States would still be shoulder to shoulder.""This statement is as important as it is clear: Australia's strategic situation has changed dramatically. Our biggest customer is now also viewed as our biggest threat. China's muscle-flexing around Taiwan last week only convinced the powerbrokers in Canberra that a war involving Taiwan is now a genuine possibility.Chinese Ambassador Xiao Qian's appearance at the National Press Club last week confirmed that view: He arrived in a suit and a velvet glove, then displayed the iron fist underneath.Ambassador Qian's address was carefully modulated. It began with words of conciliation — using terms such as ""hospitality"", ""friendly"", ""co-operative"" to describe Australia — but it ended with a clear message about Taiwan, stating: ""There's no room for compromise.""China is building, buying and offering credit to many developing nations, including in the Pacific, with an apparently insatiable desire to acquire infrastructure.A Four Corners investigation recently demonstrated that China is omnipresent in Solomon Islands.Reporter Angus Grigg noted China's presence everywhere in the capital, Honiara, from the imposing Chinese Embassy to the massive sports stadium.Even the city's garbage trucks belong to Brand Communist Party of China.Port facilities, particularly deep-water ports such as those available in Solomon Islands and Sri Lanka, are among Beijing's favourite infrastructure investments.In Australia, a Chinese company has a 99-year-lease on Darwin Port.China argues that, as the world's most active manufacturer and trader, ports are crucial to its business model.Its critics argue that, while ports are unquestionably convenient for a trading behemoth, the strategic long-term objective is to set up a port network that also benefits its navy.For those sceptical of China's motives, Darwin Port remains at the lower end of the spectrum of concern.Senior defence and intelligence figures in Canberra argue that, in the event of hostilities, Australia could retake control of Darwin Port and prevent Chinese ships from entering.However, the situation in the Solomons is trickier: Australia would need to convince the leadership in Honiara to close its port to Chinese ships.For India, it is the Chinese-built Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka that is of most concern.It's geography offers strategic benefits to Chinese ships were they to attempt to control significant portions of India's east and west coasts.The Australian Defence Force has recently announced a defence strategic review to examine the risk of ""state-on-state conflict"", which Angus Houston has called ""the worst I have ever seen in my career and my lifetime"".""It's a fast-changing environment and it's absolutely imperative that we review the current strategic circumstances,"" he said.The military rise of China is no secret but repeated displays of Chinese planes bombing imaginary ships around Taiwan, Japan and South Korea confirms that we now live in an unstable neighbourhood.General Milley could not have been clearer in sharing the US view: ""Shoulder to shoulder"" doesn't mean we give a strong speech at the UN General Assembly.It doesn't mean our Prime Minister says ""we support Washington's action and condemn Beijing's aggression"". It doesn't mean a photo opportunity for Penny Wong with her US counterpart.It means military support.The Albanese government appears to have stepped back from the harder rhetoric of the Morrison government, reflected in Liberal leader Peter Dutton's statement that it would be ""inconceivable"" for Australia not to support the US in the event of a war over Taiwan.No serious player is suggesting that Australia walks away from its alliance with the US but there is room for debate about what being ""a loyal ally"" means.If we are at war with China, then China is at war with us. What does that mean?As part of my research for this column, I asked long-time defence analyst Clinton Fernandes, one of the best-read and most-experienced military strategists in the country, for his view.This is what Professor Fernandes said:Q: Will Anthony Albanese's government change Australia's position on joining the US in any war with China, or will it remain as it was under the Coalition government?A: Peter Dutton was more up-front and candid with the Australian public than Richard Marles, who is running the same program as Dutton but without the rhetoric.Specifically, the program involves dropping sonobuoys (floating microphones with radio transmitters) to identify the acoustic signatures of Chinese submarines and allow US hunter-killer submarines to attack them at the outbreak of hostilities.The fiction is that this is about ""freedom of navigation"". It is not. It is about supporting the US's wish to conduct reconnaissance, intelligence, surveillance, targeting and other military activities in any exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world. International law is silent on whether this is legal. Australia and the US say it is. China says it isn't.Many countries that oppose China on other issues happen to agree with it on this issue. For example, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina and others take the view that warships have no automatic right of innocent passage in their territorial seas.Q: Would that make Australia a target of the Chinese?A: An Australian aircraft or ship in the South China Sea, possibly. Not the Australian landmass.Q: What would being a target of the Chinese military mean for Australia?A: We could lose a vessel with everyone on board. This could be followed by a massive social fracture in Australia. There would also be massive economic disruption to trade in the Western Pacific, since 95 per cent of Chinese trade is seaborne. The effect on global supply chains would be catastrophic.Q: Do Australians understand what supporting the US in any conflict with China could mean?A: Absolutely not. Inconvenient facts are not censored but are buried all the same. In principle, they are discoverable but, in reality, they are out of the public's awareness because, without regular repetition, no one understands or remembers them. Remember that the sonobuoys/EEZ matter is not even debated in parliament.Q: Do you expect there will be a war between the US and China in the next 10 years?A: A clash involving a Chinese aircraft intercepting an Australian aircraft while it's dropping sonobuoys, yes. Then it might escalate.Q: To reduce the chance of being involved in a military conflict with China over Taiwan, what should the new federal government do?A: Come clean with the Australian public. Tell them what we're really doing and that China does not take a benign view of its encirclement by the US Indo-Pacific Command and Australia. Tell the public that many other countries that are otherwise friendly to Australia do not agree with us or with the US about EEZ militarisation. Let parliament vote on whether we should be conducting these activities. Perhaps the public will agree with the policy — but that has clearly not been tested.Some confronting and challenging analysis by Professor Fernandes.These are the sorts of questions — and answers — Australia needs to start discussing more openly.As a nation, we must not sleepwalk into a war — particularly a war with China.","Australia, China, Foreign Affairs, Solomon Islands, Taiwan, United States, Unrest, Conflict and War, World Politics, ",2022-08-14T19:00:00+00:00

Or maybe your wallet?The reality is that few of us consider the farm the cocoa was grown on.If you do, your mind might reach for hazy images of western Africa's Ivory Coast.Yan Diczbalis,  principal horticulturalist of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, says the region supplies more than half of the global cocoa commodity market.It is a market that feeds the likes of Nestle, Hershey and Mondelez International, which produces the Cadbury brand.But it is an old market, one long muddied by allegations of child labour, slavery and underpayment of the farmers that grow the beans.""A lot of the pre-existing chocolate trading houses are out of Europe and have been around for 100, 200 years, which have grown out of this colonial commodity trade,"" Dejan Borisavljevic, owner of Indonesian-based trading company Biji Kakao Trading, said.""It's an incredibly old trade route, and of course it's had lots of issues with transparency.""Almost all the chocolate on supermarket shelves is sourced in bulk from this commodity market — and when you are talking about the trade of over 4.5 million tonnes of cocoa, it can be difficult to trace a bean's origin any further than the continent it was grown on.For consumers, this makes it almost impossible to guarantee that any of your dollars make it to the farmer.""I suppose [payments for cocoa are] beyond the remit of ours — all we know is we can't influence the commodity market at all,"" Mr Diczbalis said.Cocoa farmers growing for the commodity market rely on corporate morality and schemes like Fairtrade to ensure growers are being justly paid for their product.Mr Diczbalis says it is a system that lacks accountability.While container upon container of cocoa beans is unloaded onto the ports of Amsterdam and Hamburg another, albeit smaller, market is emerging.Between the tall, corrugated iron sheds that line Toowoomba's industrial area sits a small, unimposing building — one that you are likely to smell before you see.That aroma comes from a factory owned by a pair of Swedish chocolatiers who make Australian chocolate using cocoa beans sourced from the Solomon Islands and Indonesia.When Magda and Trevor Smith moved from Sweden to Australia, they wanted to continue their chocolate-making, but quickly realised that they would prefer a new trade route.""Europe has an established cocoa industry, that spice trade has been going on for many hundreds of years,"" Mr Smith, co-owner of Metiisto Chocolate, said.""It makes sourcing cocoa [from Europe] really easy, but what it does is distance you from the actual farms.""""You can't check where your cocoa is coming from; you've got too many people in between you and the cocoa farmers.""Instead of buying from the global commodity market, the Smiths buy their chocolate direct from Pacific farmers.Those farmers include the likes of Robert Waisu, who has been growing cocoa in the Solomon Islands for the past 35 years.Mr Waisu sells his cocoa direct to ""bean to bar"" chocolatiers like the Smiths of Toowoomba.""I'm selling my cocoa as premium cocoa that's sun-dried at an attractive premium price,"" Mr Waisu said.""The domestic market pays us here 12 [Solomon Islands] dollars per kilogram of dry beans; they [the specialty buyers] pay us more like 50 per cent on top of this.""He and other Solomon Islands cocoa farmers are proud of their cocoa's quality, something he says the rest of the world is yet to recognise.""Other people, globally, they don't really know what's going on here. But myself, I am really proud; we are really proud,"" he said.Chocolatiers like the Smiths are working to provide this recognition, labelling each of their bars with the name of the locality the cocoa was grown in.Heather Smyth, a flavour chemist at the University of Queensland, describes it as something of an emerging market.""For big companies in the likes of Cadbury, they're really looking for a very consistent cocoa flavour that matches the flavour that they had before and the year before that and the year before that,"" Dr Smyth said.""So [major corporations] will actually source cocoa from a whole lot of different regions to come up with a flavour profile which is recognisable to their customers.""""But just as we recognise that wine and coffee have diverse flavour types, we need to recognise that with cocoa as well.""""Within different regions there can be spicy notes, there's often fruity notes that are present, even citrus notes, then of course your typical chocolate and coffee flavours.""""It allows the community to receive payment for their specialty beans and for the quality of cocoa that they produce.""While work is being done to reform the traditional cocoa trade system, Mr Diczbalis says that these emerging ""bean to bar"" trade routes are a good alternative for consumers looking for a transparent supply chain.""All that sort of plantation cropping — for want of a better term — was sort of instigated during the colonial era,""  Mr Diczbalis said.""We can't go back and change the way that it was. But what we can do is work with producers currently to improve their outlook.""","Indonesia, Markets, Rural, Solomon Islands, Toowoomba, Trade, ",2022-08-10T01:43:19+00:00

broadcaster, but has dismissed claims it is going to take control of its editorial policies. Concerns have been mounting over the fate of the independence of Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation (SIBC) since it became a fully government-funded entity. Last month, the government removed the public broadcaster as a state-owned enterprise (SOE), saying its reporting was causing disunity in the country.The change has paved the way for tightening government control over SIBC's content. However, Albert Kabui — the special secretary to Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare — insisted that the broadcaster would remain independent.He said that, by removing the broadcaster as an state-owned enterprise, the government would now be able to make board appointments directly, rather than putting them out to tender. ""We would get to appoint the board members and they can talk to the management level, in line with the broadcasting policy,"" Mr Kabui told the ABC's Pacific Beat program. When pressed on whether this would allow the government to sway editorial decisions through the board, Mr Kabui denied that would happen.However, he confirmed the government was already seeking advice from the Attorney-General on how to replace the SIBC board.""Now that they have been removed as an SOE, the legal status of the appointment is in question,"" he said. ""So, that is the advice we would need to get from the Attorney-General and then we'll move on from there.""Last week, SIBC staff confirmed to the ABC that the acting chairman of the board, William Parairato, recently met with them to outline new editorial orders from the Prime Minister's office.These included vetting news and talkback shows to ensure they did not create disunity.The reports from staff came amid criticism from the government, accusing the broadcaster of a ""lack of ethics and professionalism"".According to the government, the reports said, the broadcaster had a responsibility to ""protect our people from lies and misinformation, especially when it is propagated by the national broadcaster"".However, SIBC chief executive Johnson Honimae denied the broadcaster had been ordered to self-censor, insisting the final say on what was put to air remained in the hands of its editors.   While the government was entitled to replace the board, he said he was not concerned. ""I have operated under those circumstances before, so it's not a concern at the moment,"" Mr Honimae said. ""But when we get to that, then we will see what will happen.""SIBC has been operating for 70 years, with its news and programming reaching people in the most-remote areas of the country. For many, it is their only immediate source of news. Mr Honimae confirmed the broadcaster would continue to run interviews with the opposition but, after hearing from the Prime Minister, they would aim to strike more balance in their reporting.""What I've told my staff is, 'Let's work as we've been working and do it even better, and let's leave no room for any criticism on the credibility of SIBC',"" he said. Despite the assurances from the SIBC and government, critics remain alarmed by what they see as the erosion of democratic freedoms in Solomon Islands.The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) last week called the changes an assault on press freedom and called for the SIBC to be reinstated as a state-owned enterprise.Opposition leader Matthew Wale said that, as the only source of news for many islands in the Solomons, the SIBC had significant influence in the country.""I am very, very concerned that the Prime Minister has made this step, that basically reduces the national broadcaster to a propaganda tool for the government,"" Mr Wale said. ""[It's] propagating its political interests as opposed to the national interest of having healthy political discourse and people benefiting from a diversity of views and opinions."" Mr Wale said that Mr Sogavare should also come clean about what reporting he has taken issue with.""I raised this question in Parliament and he held a red folder — everything seems to be in red these days,"" he said. ""He held a red folder with I don't know what was in it. ""He said it contained evidence of bias and insightful material.""Mr Kabui, Mr Sogavare's special secretary, said the findings were the results of a three-month analysis conducted last year of the SIBC's reporting, and he wasn't sure if he could publicly release it.Local media have been vocal about the government's increased criticism and secrecy towards the press, which has come at a politically tumultuous time for the Solomon Islands.The capital, Honiara, was shaken by violent riots in November, which saw buildings — including a police station and a leaf hut next to Parliament House — set on fire.This was followed by a no-confidence vote in Mr Sogavare, which he survived.Journalists have complained that the Prime Minister's office has become increasingly opaque since Solomon Islands signed a controversial security pact with China.When China's Foreign Minister toured the country in May, Solomon Islands media boycotted a press conference because they were collectively only allowed to ask one question, and only to their own Foreign Minister.They also struggled to get information about the timing of the visit and agreements being signed between the two countries.","Asia, China, Foreign Affairs, Journalism, Media Industry, Pacific, Solomon Islands, United States, World Politics, ",2022-08-08T20:08:58+00:00

It is quite critical.""It is not just the US and Australia, or New Zealand, who care,"" she added.""It is the Pacific Islands Forum, other countries who care very much that there not be a Chinese military base, because that would create a threat, potentially, to all of the Pacific Islands and create security concerns for all.""There has been substantial debate recently about how Australia can best navigate a potential submarine capability gap between our ageing Collins Class fleet and the proposed AUKUS program for new, nuclear-powered vessels.Ms Sherman wouldn't be drawn on whether the US would be prepared to lease or sell Australia one of its nuclear-propelled submarines in the short term.The US is facing construction delays with its current Virginia class submarines and has been exploring options for refuelling and extending the life of its older Los Angeles design. ""We have all kinds of processes that we need to go through, and all kinds of export control regulations in our country,"" she said. Ms Sherman added that any problems with the AUKUS agreement could be overcome.""I think the vision that was outlined originally is going to be realised,"" Ms Sherman said.While in Canberra, Ms Sherman met with Foreign Minister Penny Wong.According to a readout provided by the US, the pair discussed ""future opportunities to collaborate with the region to advance Pacific priorities"" and the situation in Ukraine.They also spoke about how China's recent actions near Taiwan were inflaming tensions in the region.""Nobody else is escalating. The Taiwanese are not escalating. The United States is not escalating. Australia is not. Japan is not. The only country that's escalating this situation is China,"" Ms Sherman told ABC's 7:30.""So, this is a very disproportionate response.

$17 million towards the landmark event.The United States and other Pacific nations have expressed concern over Solomon Islands' security ties with China, which they say have regional

elections could provoke more civil unrest.""This is very much in the hearts and minds of Solomon Islanders and the opposition to it is overwhelming — it's perhaps universal — in terms of opposition to an extension,"" he said.""People just see it as an extension of a corrupt government, so this is something people can't swallow really … definitely there is a high risk of a flare up again of

It's closer to Vanuatu and shell money isn't part of their culture.Terry's grand uncle Solomon Palusi says finding the shell money was ""very difficult but wasn't impossible"".""We tried our very best to take the shell money.""It's for people like Terry that a shop has recently opened in Honiara's Chinatown, selling shell money for cash, targeting three of the nine provinces in the country that use the traditional currency.Shell money shop owner Mary Sifoburi is from Langa Langa in Malaita province, a community known for crafting the currency.""Basically, the process of making shell money involves 10 steps before the product comes to completion,"" Mary says.The shells are smoothened and ground flat before a small drill is used to create a hole in the centre of the shell, and a tuna tin is used as a makeshift scale to weigh them.""In the past it would take two to three days because of the manual drill used. But now with the introduction of the new drill, a person can drill three to four tins [worth] per day,"" Mary says.The shells are placed on hot rocks to change colour before final grinding is done.It's not an easy task and it can take up to two weeks to find a single shell.""There are different kinds of shells involved in the process of shell money, so we have black shells, white shells and red shells,"" Mary says.The harder the shell is to find, the higher the value.""For now, I can say that the value is based on the people who produce the shells but because right now … we do not have any standard regulations to guide the value of the shells, the prices vary,"" she says.Father of the bride Steve Aumanu has noticed the monetary value of shell money shift over the decades but the cultural value has so far endured the test of time.""It's being commercialised, the value of the shell is called by those who produce it and those who are price takers, we don't have much choice,"" he says.With shell money now so difficult to find and its price increasing, community elders fear it will some day lose its place in the three provinces.""I don't know whether it will cease to be recognised but for the time being, the value has been ascending,"" Steve says.Back at the bride price ceremony, the bride stands with her cousins on traditional mats called ""kaufe"", which in the Malaitan custom recognises her leaving her family home with dignity and pride.An honouring ceremony of Azalea's closest aunties and grand aunties also takes place where the groom's side hands over monetary gifts in red envelopes that reflect Terry's father's Chinese heritage.The most anticipated part of the ceremony comes when the bride's father either accepts or declines the bride price from the groom's side — there have been instances where it has been rejected. But not this time around.During the ceremony, more than 20 tafulia'e are given to the bride's father by the groom's father.""Traditionally when there's a marriage ceremony between two people, that's a significant event in the life of a family or tribe and this one is no different,"" Steve says.""When we are all together to witness, it's a manifestation of a great valuable cultural undertaking.""And on the occasion of my sister's bride price ceremony, the enduring value of the shell money and the traditions that come with it, are clear.","Australia, Community and Multicultural Festivals, History, Human Interest, Pacific, Solomon Islands, ",2022-07-30T19:15:37+00:00

Instead, one member of the group pointedly asked: ""How long is the wharf and how deep is the water?""Since COVID-19 border restrictions lifted last month, talks have resumed.Silas Tausinga, a Solomon Islands MP whose electorate sits next to Kolombangara, believes China's ambition to house military assets in his country remains strong, despite months of high-level political and media attention.""Absolutely, Australia should be worried about it,"" he told Four Corners.This push is only possible because the Solomons severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of Beijing in 2019.Since then, China has mobilised funds to support the country's combative Prime Minister, Manasseh Sogavare.Documents obtained by Four Corners show a Chinese slush fund was activated twice last year and dispersed nearly $3 million directly to members of parliament loyal to the Prime Minister.One letter signed by Mr Sogavare said the Chinese embassy in Honiara ""consented"" to provide ""additional support"" for his government in August last year.That was in the lead-up to a vote of no confidence, which could have toppled the Prime Minister and undermined Beijing's ambitions in the tiny Pacific nation.Mr Sogavare described the money as a ""stimulus package"" to revitalise the economy, although it was only given to MPs loyal to him. Opposition members received nothing.""This is corruption,"" said Ruth Liloqula, the head of Transparency International in Solomon Islands.""China is keeping this government together. We all assume that China is remotely controlling the government and Solomon Islands affairs.""Weeks after riots erupted in the capital, and still fearing for the survival of his government, Mr Sogavare again activated the Chinese slush fund.The list of MPs paid in that round was almost identical to the one four months earlier, except the name of the one MP who left the government was crossed out.The only other name crossed out was an MP who had recently died.Silas Tausinga confirmed that he received the first payment when he was part of the government, but not the second one after crossing the floor to join the opposition.""I wasn't going to stay for the money,"" Mr Tausinga said.All MPs loyal to the Prime Minister received nearly $80,000 each. Ms Liloqula said those MPs have no obligation to show how the money was spent.Asked if the Chinese money allowed Mr Sogavare to retain his job, Mr Tausinga said: ""Well, he's stayed in power, hasn't he?""The Prime Minister survived the no-confidence motion on December 6.During the 36-year period when the Solomons recognised Taiwan, the prime minister of the day had a similar slush fund at his disposal. But there was also a much larger pool of money distributed to all MPs. Four Corners emailed detailed questions about these allegations to the Prime Minister's office and followed up with phone calls and texts. We received no response.Beijing's desire for a military presence in the Solomons was revealed in a recently leaked letter from 2020, in which a Chinese defence contractor sought to lease land in Isabel Province to develop ""naval and infrastructure projects"" for the ""People's Liberation Army Navy"".Mr Sogavare has assured Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese that China will not be allowed to build a military base in the Solomons. But despite a friendly meeting between the pair at the recent Pacific Islands Forum, suspicion remains about China's intentions.Clive Moore, a Pacific expert from the University of Queensland, said in the longer term China could use its economic outposts in the Solomons for military purposes.""I think we have to look with new eyes at the way that bases can be developed for Chinese interests in the Pacific,"" he said.""China has interest in minerals, it has interest in timber. They are interested in developing situations where in the future they may be able to be used for other purposes.""The forestry plantation on Kolombangara offers both economic and strategic opportunities.If a Chinese entity took over the plantation it would control two-thirds of the island, including 14,000 hectares of hardwood forest, 24,000 hectares of protected forest, the port, a marine base, the airstrip and large areas of flat land.""With a large Chinese corporation, you can be quite certain that they are acting with a great deal of advice from the Chinese central government. Whether that investment is in logging or in mining … there is a connection,"" Clive Moore said.In late May, as talks with China Forestry Group Corporation continued, members of the plantation company's board, Kolombangara Forests Products Ltd (KFPL), wrote to Foreign Minister Penny Wong about the ""risks/strategic threats"" it posed to Australia.It urged the Australian government to provide financial assistance to ""prevent China taking control of the port and airstrip areas and establishing a base that can easily be done under the cover of commercial development"".The letter said Kolombangara has ""the best natural deep-water port in the Solomons that could be used for a large vessel immediately"".The Foreign Minister was told in the letter that any Australian government funding would provide an opportunity for the two countries to forge closer economic ties around sustainable development and logging in the Pacific.The plantation is owned by private Taiwanese and Australian shareholders, in conjunction with the Solomon Islands government. The letter said the Solomons government had approached the board about the deal with China Forestry Group Corporation.Senator Wong's office said Australia's High Commissioner in Honiara ""has been engaging regularly with the management of [the plantation] and will continue to do so"", not ruling out an intervention.When asked how worried he was about a Chinese buyer coming in, KFPL general manager Edwin Schramm said there was some concern on the island.""Local people don't see that as generally a positive move … and they would like to see the existing shareholders, particularly the Solomon Islands government, maintain a strong presence on the island,"" he said.Kolombangara sits across from the provincial and economic centre of Noro, home to the country's tuna fleet.In the nearby town of Munda, China is relaying the airport tarmac and building a new international terminal.China has made no secret of its ambitions in the country's west. In June, ambassador Li Ming donated fishing boats, eskys and engines to locals on Marovo Island.""China will continue to support Western Province and China will continue to support the Solomon Islands,"" he said.For its part, Australia has agreed to fund early planning and design work to upgrade the international container port at Noro with money from the Solomon Islands Infrastructure Program.Canberra is also funding the construction of six mobile phone towers across the country, in an effort to plug gaps in the network.It's an area where the Solomons has once again turned to China.Chinese tech giant Huawei, which has been banned from building new networks in Australia and the US, is pushing to construct about 160 mobile phone towers across the Solomons.Under the current plan, the towers would be funded through a $US55 million ($78.7m) loan from China with the remaining $US16 million coming from the Solomons government.Four Corners has obtained a report that casts serious doubt over the project's financial viability and construction time line, while others question the need for so many towers.The report from consulting firm KPMG said the project's ""financial forecasts are optimistic"" and the operator of the towers would need to inject $US156 million of cash into the project over 20 years.Experts have questioned whether the country could ever repay the debt, while others fear the deal could even bankrupt Solomon Telekom if it was forced to pay for the towers.""It concerns me because it is in who's interest?"" Ms Liloqula said.""Is it [being] built for Solomon Islands or is it built for China's interest?""Watch Four Corners' full investigation on ABC iview.Editor's note: August 1, 2022: An earlier version of the story said the Department of Foreign Affairs would not be intervening in the plantation deal.

When you chose to come to our Pacific Islands, be respectful, be courteous and accord the appropriate protocols.""Such organisations or journalists who possess such qualities will not be allowed to enter Solomon Islands and other Pacific Islands nations.""The statement does not provide any details about exactly how this ban would be implemented, or exactly what restrictions might be imposed on foreign reporters.It's not clear exactly when the new rules will be implemented, whether any guidelines have yet been drafted, or whether they will apply to all foreign journalists.Right now, Australians who wish to enter the country, including journalists, are able to apply for a visa on arrival.The ABC first revealed earlier this week that Solomon Islands may introduce new restrictions on foreign journalists perceived as hostile to the government.The ABC also revealed that Foreign Affairs officials complained to Australia's High Commissioner Lachlan Strahan about the Four Corners program, although Mr Sogavare's office insisted the government had not ""summoned"" Dr Strahan, but simply raised concerns about the program in a ""neighbourly chat"".It's not clear what officials pressed Dr Strahan to do in the wake of the Four Corners episode.The ABC has editorial independence from the federal government which means ministers and senior officials cannot exert any control over what it puts to air.But the Prime Minister’s statement said the government was ""deeply concerned that such offensive materials are produced by ABC and are allowed to be broadcasted to Pacific Islands states"".Some Solomon Islands reporters are already increasingly worried that press freedoms in the country are beginning to erode.The Solomon Islands government has moved to replace the board of the publicly funded broadcaster SIBC and has stripped the organisation of its status as a state-owned enterprise, although it insists it will not try to control any editorial content.It has also been exploring the possibility of setting up a state-owned newspaper, which could have serious financial ramifications for private media outlets in Solomon Islands.","Foreign Affairs, Journalism, Media Industry, Pacific, Solomon Islands, ",2022-08-24T22:08:05+00:00

One of the things we need to do is build personal relations between Australia and our friends in the Pacific,""  he told Channel Nine.""To make sure that our interests, but also their interests, are protected.""We need to be prepared to listen to what they have to say, be prepared to assist in their development. But also be prepared to advocate, as my government is, action on issues of concern to them.""Separately, Mr Sogavare — who has rejected multiple requests for interviews from the ABC and other media outlets — also gave an interview to Guardian Australia while in Suva.The Prime Minister — who has accused media outlets of peddling misinformation about his country — said he had no intention of allowing any country to establish a military base in his country, because it may make it a target.""The moment we establish a foreign military base, we immediately become an enemy. And we also put our country and our people as targets for potential military strikes,"" he said.""I have said it before and I will say it again, that is not in someone's interest, nor the interest of the region for any military base, to be established in any Pacific Island country, let alone Solomon Islands.""Mr Sogavare told the Guardian that Australia remains the ""partner of choice"" for Solomon Islands and that his government would ""call on them first"" if facing security woes in the future.Australia sent troops and police to Solomon Islands in November last year to quell riots that broke out in the capital, Honiara.But Mr Sogavare later lashed out at Australia, alleging that officials told him the police wouldn't be willing to protect Chinese infrastructure projects in Honiara. Australian officials are adamant that claim is false.Mr Sogavare told the Guardian that his government could still ask China for security assistance in the future if there was a ""gap"" in support.""If there is any gap, we will not allow our country to go down the drain. If there is a gap, we will call on support from China,"" he said.""But we've made it very clear to the Australians, and many times when we have this conversation with them, that they are a partner of choice.

He turns up at our events. Well, that's cool.""Mr Kenilorea, 49, is now a key figure in the opposition United Party, which has formed a coalition in Solomon Islands politics.The current Prime Minister, Manasseh Sogavare, has a strong grip on power with his coalition holding 38 seats of the 50-seat parliament.Mr Sogavare will be seeking a fifth term, although it's still not clear when the election will be. The ABC tried mutiple avenues to speak to Mr Sogavare in Honiara, but our interview requests were ignored. The Prime Minister is also trying to amend the country's constitution to push back the vote until after the 2023 Pacific Games, hosted by Honiara.Even if Mr Kenilorea's coalition wins more seats in the next election, there are likely to be a number of contenders for leader and he would need the support of his peers.He said the talk of him as a future leader was ""humbling"" and ""flattering"".Speaking to the ABC from opposition headquarters in Honiara, he said closer ties with Australia would be a top priority, should they win government at the next election.""Our relationship with Australia is one that I would like to really take up to the next level,"" he said.""It's quite rare to have a least developed country [low-income country] … two and a half hours away from Brisbane.""He said the coalition would also scrap the country's controversial security partnership with China.""We don't need that security agreement,"" he said.""And it's something that we see as being beneficial to China rather than it is to us.""But Mr Kenilorea stopped short of committing to reversing the diplomatic switch from China back to Taiwan.""It's something we're considering and that'll be a process to do it when we do switch back,"" he said.""As we sit here now, there is a big pull to switch back for sure, that's something that we're hearing people telling us already.""He also wants to prioritise the country's youth, who are struggling with issues of unemployment and jobs – a situation he said was ""dire"".Among the policies his party will take to the next election is lifting tertiary education rates from 4 per cent to 10 per cent, and encouraging more students in practical fields such as the sciences and engineering.Young people are among the most eager to talk about the future of their country.Many told the ABC they are concerned about their country's deepening ties with China.Frustration spilled over last November, when riots in Honiara razed the local Chinatown.International police – including from Australia – were bought in to quell the unrest.""The initial peaceful protests that happened before the riots was really about the power that the provinces have, versus the national government over key decisions,"" said Dr Anouk Ride, affiliate researcher with the University of Melbourne.""When the national government changed bilateral relations from Taiwan to China, part of the resentment about that was the decision.""The riots were largely blamed on disaffected youth, and that has angered many young people, including Neil Nuia.Mr Nuia is deeply embedded in the community and runs workshops for young people through his arts hub, Dreamcast.""Young people should never be blamed for that,"" he said.""The whole thing has been manipulated — the young people are being manipulated to do these things.""In Solomons, a majority of the young people do not understand how the systems work, especially the governance system and which functions the government play and stuff.""Thirty-two-year-old Joe Wale, from the outer Honiara suburb of Papaho, agreed.""The riots that happened shouldn't be blamed on us, the young people in rural areas,"" he said.""I think it's an issue inside the parliament and one for the government to resolve.""Young entrepreneur Millicent Barty has recently returned from a year in the United States as a prestigious Obama scholar.She said she felt her country had changed since she'd been away, and she was uncomfortable about the growing ties with China.""I'm very happy to be home and I just came at the right time, [around] Solomon Islands Independence Day, but to be honest, it's been different,"" Ms Barty said.""I feel with China, it was just sort of like a big wave just came through and no one was prepared.""And that just heightens the anxiety we feel, especially when a government doesn't communicate openly or is not transparent in its dealings.""The issue of China looms large in Honiara in other ways.A large sports precinct is being built in time for the 2023 Pacific Games, funded and built by China.The ABC met a number of young people playing basketball and futsal near the main Holy Cross Church in Honiara.Many of them are happy to see the stadium built.""The other stadiums that will be built by China and other countries will be great for Solomon Islanders, especially with the players, because we haven't had those facilities before,"" basketball player Alex Masaea said.Twenty-two-year-old Britney Pasia agreed.""It's a good thing for young people,"" she said.""Thank you, China, for helping Solomon Islands Government, for building this for us.""But Peter Kenilorea said questions remained about how the stadium would be looked after when the games were over.""Solomon Islanders love sport… but in terms of the actual infrastructure, I think it's a bit of an overkill for us,"" he said. ""We don't need those big stadiums, we don't need those pools.""What will happen after the games is my big concern.""The upkeep of those [stadiums] would be very difficult to maintain.""The ABC has put in repeated requests for an interview with Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare.The ABC also requested an interview with the Youth Ministry.Solomon Islands is set to go to the polls next year, but the government has indicated it wants to extend the parliamentary term.Millicent Barty said she wanted change, and she hopes Mr Kenilorea will be part of it.""A lot

And of course, from Australia's own point of view, we want to engage more.""The Vice-President was granted a platform to meet Pacific leaders and make the sweeping series of announcements even though the forum had moved to sideline most major powers at the leaders' meeting.It has already delayed a separate meeting with Dialogue Partners – including the United States, China, Japan, the United Kingdom and India – in order to allow the forum to focus on trying to heal the rift with Micronesian nations.But the Biden administration's announcements — and the Vice-President's appearance at the Forum at such a delicate moment – is yet another sign that the US is intent on reasserting its presence and influence in the region as China continues to expand its footprint.A senior administration official said the US was ""embarking on a new chapter of a long-standing partnership"" with the Pacific and ""significantly stepping up our game in the Pacific islands"".Graeme Smith, senior fellow at the Australian National University's Department of Pacific Affairs, said there was significance in Ms Harris's invitation coming directly from Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama.In the past Fiji had played an interesting role, often being seen as doing ""Beijing's bidding"", he told the ABC. ""There has been a few things in recent years that have indicated that might be cooling, and this seems to be another indication of that,"" he said.Dr Smith said the US announcements were ""a step back in the right direction"" and in-line with what the Pacific had been asking for in terms of commercial engagement and aid.The US was showing up and answering calls to be more present on the ground rather than not having any representation there, he said.Kiribati's withdrawal from the PIF has been a dominating topic in the lead-up to the four-day leaders' meeting.The senior administration official said the US was concerned by the move, but all plans would go ahead regardless of whether an agreement was reached for Kiribati to remain.""We think obviously that PIF is stronger when united – it's the whole point of the organisation … that countries can join together and speak as one … especially on climate,"" the official said.Kiribati's decision has some Pacific countries concerned that it could result in the island country being drawn closer to China.Kiribati Opposition Leader Tessie Lambourne told the ABC's Pacific Beat program that she was ""shocked"" to learn of the withdrawal and hoped the government had not succumbed to external pressure.""I hope that there is no other reason for leaving the forum family. I sincerely hope that there hasn't been any influence on our government's decision from other external sources,"" she said.""That's something of a concern to us. It is so unlike Kiribati to make a dramatic decision like this.""Dr Smith said the US could move to offer Kiribati a ""compact deal"" to alleviate any concerns about the Micronesian state.""That's something I'd be looking for, because it was something that had been discussed on the fringes for a few years,"" he said. ""Because of where it is on the planet — just under Hawaii — you would expect some sort of further US reaction down the line.""Upon arriving in Fiji on Tuesday, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong told reporters that forum members, including Australia, would seek reconciliation with Kiribati.""Competition is one of the challenges the region faces, and it is best faced together,"" she said.In his opening ceremony address, Mr Bainimarama stressed the most important issue for the forum was unity.He said he respected the Kiribati President's position, but would continue working towards a resolution that is in the best interests of the Pacific people.""It is my personal belief … that we are at our most resilient as a family. We speak more powerfully as a family, and we can only build our best possible future together as a family,"" he said.""We simply cannot make the same difference for the health, security and prosperity of our people without every Pacific voice helping to chart the course of our region's direction.""","Asia, Australia, Climate Change, Defence and National Security, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Kiribati, National Security, New Zealand, Pacific, Solomon Islands, United States, World Politics, ",2022-07-12T09:01:30+00:00

each other warmly while meeting face to face for the first time on the sidelines of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) in Fiji. Tensions between Australia and Solomon Islands have intensified in the wake of Honiara's decision to strike a contentious security pact with China.But the initial exchange between the two leaders showed positive signs the countries could smooth their increasingly strained relationship.""Ahhh, I need a hug!"" Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said as the pair embraced. ""It's good to meet you and thank you for the discussion we've had on the phone about our common interests,"" Mr Albanese told him.""The relationship between us is very important and there's much more we can do to cooperate and develop those relationships of trust.""Mr Sogavare said Solomon Islands and Australia had been friends even before independence.""We are family and there are many issues, and that makes family stronger,"" Mr Sogavare said.Details of the pact with China have not been disclosed, but Mr Sogavare has ruled out allowing Beijing to have a military base in Solomon Islands. When questioned on the issue earlier in the day, Mr Albanese would not say whether he would press his counterpart on the pact.He said he would aim to have an honest discussion.""And that means not necessarily agreeing with each other the whole time, but it means being able to have an open dialogue,"" he said. Mr Albanese arrived in the Fijian capital on Wednesday saying he wanted to bring ""positive energy"" to the forum to help heal divisions which threaten the unity of the peak regional body.He also welcomed the Biden administration's promise to ramp up its diplomatic engagement in the region.The meeting of foreign leaders in Suva has been overshadowed by internal divisions after Kiribati announced it would quit the forum.The controversy has its roots in a complex dispute over leadership, but the opposition in Kiribati has accused China of driving the decision.Mr Albanese would not be drawn on the cause of the split when asked about it in Suva, saying he wanted to focus on how to heal the rift.""What I want to do and what I bring to this forum is a positive energy, and I'll be doing all that I can to bring all of the nations who are members of the Pacific Forum together,"" he told reporters.Several Micronesian leaders have been trying to reach the President of Kiribati, Taneti Maamau, but so far he has refused to return calls.Mr Albanese arrived in Fiji after US Vice-President Kamala Harris laid out a suite of new measures to boost America's presence in the region, telling Pacific Island leaders this morning the region had not always ""received the diplomatic attention and support that you deserve"".She also warned that nations in the Pacific must be ""free from aggression or coercion"" in a clear reference to China.""At a time when we see bad actors seeking to undermine the rules-based order, we must stand united,"" she told the forum.""We must remind ourselves that [by] upholding a system of laws, institutions,and common understandings, this is how we ensure stability and indeed prosperity around the world.""Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama responded warmly to the new commitments and took a swipe at the former US president Donald Trump's administration, saying the US was now ""looking a lot more like the Pacific partner we have traditionally held it to be"".There was a brief kerfuffle during the Vice-President's address after two Chinese embassy officials entered the room, despite not being formally invited.The two men — who the ABC has been told are the defence attaché and the deputy defence attaché at the Chinese embassy in Suva — were asked to leave the venue after they stood in the media area and were identified by a Fijian journalist.However the officials later returned to the back of the room where the Vice-President's address was taking place.It is not clear if they were given permission to do so, and when the ABC approached the two men after the event they declined to speak.Mr Albanese also praised the new announcements from the Biden administration, saying it would ""renew"" the US commitment to the region.Former Kiribati president Anote Tong told The Drum he was surprised by Kiribati's withdrawal from the Pacific Islands Forum.""It's unheard of,"" he said.""In the entire history of the forum, I don't recall any country withdrawing.""But he said his country would welcome the US Vice-President's announcement the US would open two new embassies in the region – including one in Kiribati – and appoint its first-ever envoy to the Pacific.""An embassy in Kiribati is something that we have always been asking for,"" Mr Tong said.""It would be very unusual that President Taneti Maamau will not accept this, and I think there would be very strong public opinion to have one.""Research fellow and director of the Pacific Institute at ANU, George Carter, is also confident that Pacific leaders will find a way to re-engage with the current Kiribati President.""Just like the Micronesian exit, when it was announced a year ago, there was a pathway in which leaders reached out,"" Mr Carter told The Drum.""That's part of Pacific regionalism and what we call the Pacific family.""There will be an avenue to bring President Maamau back to the fold, and hopefully we will see this unveiled when the leaders come out of the retreat.""","Asia, Australia, Defence and National Security, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Kiribati, National Security, New Zealand, Pacific, Solomon

[leaders] who seem to have forgotten the awful lessons learned here, or perhaps never took them to heart in the first place,"" she said.""Leaders who believe that others must be diminished if they are to rise... leaders who believe that the principles and institutions the world set up after the Second World War, the rules-based international order... can be ignored and undermined, diminished and destroyed.""Today we are once again engaged in a different kind of struggle — a struggle that will go on for some time to come.""Ms Sherman said it was ""up to us"" to realise a future defined by shared values and vision for a ""free and open, and prosperous and secure, and above all peaceful Indo-Pacific"".Also present at the event was the US ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy. She paid respect to Solomon Islanders who had ""risked their lives"" to help the allied forces hold Guadalcanal during WWII.Ms Kennedy said countless Americans and family members of allied personnel have the Solomon Scouts and Coastwatchers to thank for the survival of many during the war.This also included Ms Kennedy's father, former US president John F. Kennedy, who had served as a captain on a patrol torpedo boat in the Solomon Islands during WWII and famously helped save the lives of fellow crew members after the ship sank.Mr Kennedy and the other survivors were later spotted by Australian Coastwatch unit and rescued from a nearby island by two Solomon Islander scouts.She said she was ""deeply touched to be here today, knowing that I might not be here if it were not for Biaku Gasa and Eroni Kumana"", referring to the two Solomon Islander Scouts who had saved her father's life.The ambassador heard first-hand details of her famous father's lucky escape, during a tour of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra last week.The six-month battle, which claimed the lives of more than 25,000 allied and Japanese servicemen, marked a turning point in the allies' war in the Pacific and showed the strategic importance of the Solomon Islands.Ms Sherman's own father, Mal Sherman, served as US Marines during World War II and fought in the Battle of Guadalcanal.Ms Sherman is currently on a tour of the region as part of the US's re-engagement in the Pacific. Earlier in the week, her delegation visited Samoa and Tonga, where the US has expressed an interest to establish an embassy in the Tongan capital, as well as in Kiribati and Solomon Islands.After the memorial event, she met with Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare to discuss topics including bilateral cooperation on tackling COVID-19 and poverty, as well as the opening of a US embassy in Honiara.She is expected to next travel to Canberra to meet with Foreign Minister Penny Wong to discuss bilateral trade and the combating of climate change.","Australia, Foreign Affairs, History, Pacific, Solomon Islands, United States, Unrest, Conflict and War, World Politics, World War 2, ",2022-08-07T08:50:05+00:00
88,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-07-12/pacific-islands-forum-meeting-fiji-a-long-time-coming/101214972,"It's been a long time coming.Pacific Island leaders will gather later this week in Fiji's capital Suva for their first face-to-face meeting in almost three years.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will be there, along with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and a host of Pacific heavyweights, ranging from Fiji's Frank Bainimarama to the mercurial Solomon Islands leader Manasseh Sogavare and Samoa's Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mataʻafa.The Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders meeting has not always been a high-profile gathering, and was once viewed with benevolent indifference in parts of Canberra.But all that has changed in recent years as Australian leaders and officials — with one eye on China's growing influence across the region — move to rejuvenate ties with a vast Pacific neighbourhood.This year's PIF leaders' meeting is shaping up as one of the most consequential in years. And the reasons go well beyond China.The unity and future of the forum will be front and centre this week.Over the weekend, Kiribati dealt the forum a severe blow. Its President wrote a letter to PIF Secretary General Henry Puna declaring he wouldn't travel to Fiji for the leaders meeting and that his nation would withdraw from the body immediately.The announcement has its roots in a bitter dispute over leadership, with Micronesian nations — including Kiribati — accusing countries from Polynesia and Melanesia of ditching a ""gentleman's agreement"" to hand the job of PIF secretary-general to their chosen candidate.All five countries declared they'd quit the body, sparking a prolonged bout of regional diplomacy to try and hold it together.It might sound like an arcane dispute, but it has real consequences. Pacific officials worry that if the forum splits it could undermine their international advocacy on climate change, and could leave smaller Pacific states more vulnerable to the sharper edges of geopolitical contestation.Last month, Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama seemed to have orchestrated a compromise, bringing together key leaders to Fiji to sign the Suva Agreement, which guarantees the secretary-general position would be rotated through the three sub-regions in the future.Some key Micronesian leaders abandoned their demand that the current secretary-general Henry Puna step down immediately in return for a promise that their candidate will take the position in 2024.But President Taneti Maamau wasn't present at that meeting – and in his extraordinary letter to Mr Puna he declared he was not satisfied with the Suva Agreement and that Kiribati would quit the Forum immediately because it ""could not set aside the values and principles that we firmly stand on.""The President of the Federated States of Micronesia David Panuelo has told the ABC that he and other Micronesian leaders – as well as Mr Bainimarama – were still trying to reach Mr Maamau to convince him to change his mind.But he said so far they'd had no luck getting the President to return their calls.""We are attempting to do that with no avail, but it's not going to stop there. We are going to keep on reaching out to our brother President Maamau to get him to return to the Forum family,"" he said.He also said that Australia had offered to help transport Micronesian leaders to Kiribati to help broker a solution, while Mr Bainimarama wanted to send a senior envoy to the country for talks. Both efforts were ignored, but Mr Paneulo isn't giving up.""Our olive branch is still extended to Kiribati to come back to the Forum family. That's our aim and that's what Micronesian nations are doing and that's what the Forum Chair is doing,"" he said.""Not having a member sign on is unfortunate but the door, I believe, is open for Kiribati to come back on board.""Still, while several countries are still trying to find a breakthrough, as things stand the Forum looks likely to lose a longstanding member, dealing a blow to regional unity.The Pacific has regularly made international headlines over the last few months as strategic competition in the region rapidly heats up and a host of high-profile visitors — from Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to White House Asia Pacific tsar Kurt Campbell and Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong — trace arcs between regional capitals.This year, the major powers have been (politely) asked to stay away from the PIF leaders meeting; a traditional Dialogue Partners gathering has been shelved in an attempt to lower the temperature in Suva, and to let PIF nations focus on some core internal issues like the threat of a split. However, the White House made a last-minute announcement on Tuesday that Vice-President Kamala Harris will participate virtually in the leaders' meeting.Ms Harris will underscore the commitment of the US to the Pacific and discuss opportunities to deepen engagement in the region, the White House said. The absence of the group of forum partners doesn't mean the meeting will be hermetically sealed from the tensions stoked by great power plays for influence and position.Chinese officials may not be physically present at this meeting but two of the agreements Beijing has pursued — one still in limbo, the other signed, sealed and delivered – will still generate discussion and debate.The first is the deeply contentious China-Solomon Islands security pact.Australia and New Zealand were both aghast when Honiara signed the agreement in April, fearing it might pave the way for a Chinese military presence down the track, and have made it clear they want it on the agenda when leaders gather in Suva this week.The forum typically tries to avoid direct confrontation and puts a high premium on consensus.The final communique issued by leaders is unlikely to feature any sort of denunciation of the security agreement.Any criticism — or ""concerns"" — will be phrased delicately and couched in careful generalisations.But Australia and New Zealand still believe they can create the space at PIF for other Pacific Island nations to voice their consternation – both directly and indirectly, in private and in public — about the implications of the agreement, and the secrecy surrounding it.Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has already publicly declared that he will not allow China to open a military base in his country, accusing critics of the deal of fanning hysteria and paranoia.Australia has publicly welcomed that assurance, even if some in Canberra remain deeply sceptical about its value.And Australian officials will be hoping that most Pacific leaders will make it clear to Mr Sogavare (and, perhaps, any other Pacific nations contemplating similar agreements) that they would view a Chinese military presence in the region as deeply destabilising.Leaders are also expected to discuss China's contentious push for a sweeping regional agreement with 10 Pacific Island states.China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi failed to land the pact while hosting a meeting with Pacific foreign ministers from Suva in May, although Beijing has vowed it will continue to pursue the deal.But consensus remains elusive. The Federated States of Micronesia has warned the agreement could undermine the sovereignty of Pacific nations, while Samoa's Fiamē Naomi Mataʻafa suggested the process had been rushed, and that she'd like the forum to take carriage of the issue.That could be a way to quietly bury the whole proposal, as many forum members – not just Australia and New Zealand but also several Pacific nations which recognise Taiwan rather than the People's Republic of China – would like to quickly consign the pact to the rubbish bin of history.Pacific leaders will also make sure they carve out time and space to lay out their own key priorities and strategies, rather than simply navigating their way around agreements and compacts being pushed by major players from outside the region.They will use the meeting to launch their 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, which is expected to lay out the Pacific's long-term approach to a range of critical challenges, ranging from security to climate change to economic development.The document probably won't contain any stunning shifts in policy, but will still be an important and definitive statement from the region about what it values most and the priorities it will pursue as the world heats up and jockeying for influence in the region intensifies.The 2050 strategy being launched in Suva is likely to focus sharply on climate change, which weighs more heavily on the minds of Pacific leaders than any other single issue.PIF has declared for years that climate change represents an existential threat to their island homes, and in the last decade it has explicitly recast it as a core question of national security for Pacific Island countries.In 2018 for example, all PIF nations issued the Boe Declaration, which identifies climate change as the region's number one security threat.Climate change is also uncomfortable terrain for Australia in regional diplomacy, because it is by far the largest emitter in the Pacific, and because its economy has flourished off fossil fuel exports which are driving the crisis.A report launched by the Climate Council last week found that Australia was responsible for about 84 per cent of the Pacific's total emissions, with per capita emissions almost 10 times higher than smaller Pacific Island states.There was an acrimonious debate over climate policy at the last face-to-face PIF leaders meeting in Tuvalu, with Pacific Island leaders lashing out at Scott Morrison after an ill-tempered argument about his government's climate change policies.Some of that rancour has since drained away in the wake of Labor's election victory, and several Pacific countries have lined up to praise the new government for ratcheting up its climate goals and promising to cut emissions by 43 per cent by 2030.But that doesn't mean Australia and the Pacific are on the same page, or that climate change won't feature at this year's leaders meeting.There is still a big gap between the new Labor government's commitments and what Pacific states want.Australia, for example, is still pressing ahead with massive new gas field plans, even though Pacific leaders have declared there's ""no room"" for new fossil fuel projects if the region's future is going to be assured.That gap will open opportunities for both civil society and governments in the Pacific who want Australia to lift its climate ambitions, as well as creating possible flashpoints.For example, Vanuatu is hoping that all PIF leaders will endorse its push to get the International Court of Justice to issue an advisory opinion on climate change – a move that could have far-reaching implications.But Vanuatu needs to win support at the United Nations General Assembly to issue its request.Late last week PIF Foreign Ministers backed Vanuatu's bid, in a clear sign that leaders are likely to do the same this week.But Vanuatu and Pacific Island states will want Australia to throw its full weight behind the campaign; and they have plenty of leverage points in this space.The new Labor government has flagged that it wants to co-host a United Nations COP meeting on climate change with Pacific Island nations in order to generate global momentum for more ambitious action.Pacific countries might say that if Australia wants joint hosting rights then it needs to do more, either by lifting its 2030 target or by agreeing to work out a transition away from coal and gas exports.When it comes to climate change, urgency and ambition are key to Pacific Island nations","Australia, China, Climate Change, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, National Security, New Zealand, Pacific, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-07-11T18:52:57+00:00

""We don't allow Chinese companies here.""Mr Suidani is a controversial figure in Solomon Islands.He's the leader of Malaita, the most populous province in the country; a long, unique and mysterious island about 100 kilometres north of the country's capital, Honiara.A former school teacher, Mr Suidani is new to politics, only being elected to his post in 2019.In Solomon Islands politics, the premiers of its nine provinces, such as Mr Suidani, are generally stunted by the central government in Honiara, which is led by Prime Minster Manasseh Sogavare and holds almost autonomous power.But Mr Suidani is pushing back in what one expert described as ""an extreme example"" of a grab for more self-determination.For most Malaitans, he's a hero — a man standing up to China in a country that recently opened its arms to the Asian superpower.Yet, in the capital, the government considers him a troublemaker; a man stifling much-needed development and stoking long-held tensions in a country that's been simmering.When asked to describe the reasons for his anti-China stance, Mr Suidani tries to stop himself from smiling. He has a long list.The first one is 'The Switch'.In 2019, the Solomon Islands government changed its allegiance from Taiwan to China. So Mr Suidani created ""the Auki Communique"", banning Chinese-backed investment in the province.He supports and recognises Taiwan.And there's more.He says infrastructure built by the Chinese ""doesn't last"". They use the ""cheap stuff"" — he'd prefer Japanese, Australian or New Zealand companies.In 2019, Lowy Institute analysis found ""evidence suggests that, if left alone, Chinese state firms will cut corners and inflate prices. If managed properly, they can deliver good quality infrastructure.""Further, as a ""Christian province"" Mr Suidani says the ""atheism"" in China means they can’t ""walk together"".And, once the Chinese come into a place, he says, Pacific countries don't have ""the power"" or ""safeguards"" to ""look after ourselves"". Then the Chinese ""change the system"". But perhaps more potently, he says he's simply standing up for his people -- the proud people of Malaita.""We are a democracy in Malaita, we believe in the principles of democracy,"" Mr Suidani says.""They are a communist nation. We are very mindful of involving the Communist Party here.""They must not come, in any way.""Chinese influence in Solomon Islands isn't new.Chinese run and owned retail shops have been in the country for decades. There are even a few in Malaita — a fact Mr Suidani says is fine as they established themselves ""before my time"".Chinese immigration into Solomon Islands goes back to before World War II and some of the most prominent Solomon Islanders have Chinese heritage.There's even a famous song in Solomon Islands culture, Walkabout Long Chinatown — the country's equivalent of Waltzing Matilda.But since 'The Switch', tensions over Chinese influence in Solomon Islands have elevated.Experts say it does not have broad public support and many, including Mr Suidani, accused the Chinese of bribery.In November, angry mobs — many from Malaita — demanded Mr Sogavare resign.He refused, and parts of the city's Chinatown were burnt to the ground, with buildings flying Taiwan flags spared. Although some of the rioters were simply using the unrest as an opportunity to steal or make trouble, Mr Sogavare saw it as direct violent uprising to depose him. Additional Australian forces were sent in to help keep the peace, and later Chinese forces arrived. Last week Mr Sogavare announced the Chinese presence would be ""permanent"".   Mr Suidani has been accused of stoking the fire and even having a direct role in the riots — a fact he denies.""Governments should respond to people,"" he says. ""If you continue to ignore the wants of the people, then you should expect something to happen.""In the months leading up to the riots he was in Taiwan getting medical treatment — another issue that has infuriated both the Chinese and the Solomon Islands governments. He has continued diplomatic ties with Taiwan in spite of 'The Switch', and controversially accepted Taiwanese aid during the COVID pandemic.  Others are concerned Mr Suidani's stance, which also includes a push for independence, will stoke long-held conflict in the country. In 1998, Solomon Islands descended into civil war known as 'The Tensions' — an ethnic conflict between Malaitans and the Guadalcanal people, the island where Honiara sits.Australia sent in a security force known as RAMSI to quell the violence, with 7,200 soldiers and 1,700 Australian Federal Police officers doing time in the country over 14 years.Although the flashpoint of the conflict this time around is different, Australian National University affiliate researcher Anouk Ride says her ""greatest fear"" is that violent conflict will once again hit the country.      Ms Ride, a Solomon Islands-based expert in conflict studies, says many citizens feel powerless about the decisions made in Honiara. On China, she says the ""real issue"" concerns the national government pushing through 'The Switch' without any real consultation.The last election was held in April 2019, before the switch to China. The Sogavare government is attempting to push the next national election back a year to after the 2023 Pacific Games — a move experts say has China's fingerprints all over it.""So there's been no chance for the general population to weigh in and say if the government is going in the right direction,"" Ms Ride says. ""This is allowing the conflict to simmer."" Speaking on Mr Suidani, Ms Ride says he had detractors, particularly in the government, but as far as she's aware the Prime Minster has never mentioned Mr Suidani's name in public.She says the Malaitan premier has ""strong support"" from his people, and even in other parts of Solomon Islands.  ""I travel around many provinces, and leaders say 'oh Suidani, he's a good man',"" Ms Ride says.""So they know him, and the ideas he represents [have] popular support.""[As a Premier], that's quite remarkable for Solomon Islands.""On the outskirts of Auki, there's a little village called Kilusakwalo.It's a typical Solomon Islands' village, with straw huts, a chapel, coconut trees and a grassed common area.   Mr Suidani is on the way in for one of his twice-monthly ""village tours"" across the remote and vast island — a concept he introduced to ""speak to the people"". The ABC joined him on the road outside. In typical Pacific fashion, there's a wait, a long one, then out of nowhere a truck appears. On the tray top, a band of traditional pan pipers start playing their music as the villagers stream out of no where to say hello to their premier. Mr Suidani is unmoved, according to his advisors this type of reception is par for the course across the vast, 180km-long island of Malaita.In the village square, a huge crowd assembles to hear their premier speak.But first, there are the formalities.  ""Please stand for the national, oh I mean, the Malaitan provincial anthem,"" the MC says, correcting himself.   After the anthem Mr Suidani rises to the podium.His calm demeanour one-on-one is in direct contrast to his on-stage persona. His oration is powerful and animated, speaking to the people and answering questions for three hours.The themes focus on China, 'The Switch', the Malaitan push for independence and the ""problems"" with the Sogavare government.  ""God bless Malaita, and god bless everyone,"" he says, finishing his speech. Kilo Sa Qualo is a stone's throw from the Fiu bridge — the one Mr Suidani blocked the Chinese from building.     The road on the way to the village is littered with potholes, a familiar site across the island.But even though the area is in dire need of infrastructure upgrades, village chief Nemuel Malesu strongly supports Mr Suidani and his stance.""He speaks for the people of Malaita, we don't support 'The Switch',"" Mr Malesu says.""With China, we don't trust them. They've got money, but we're scared they will put us into debt. ""We want a new government, one that will tell China to go back home."" Mr Suidani has suffered some blowback in the area, with a small number of Malaitans last year protesting his stance to knock back the Chinese development of the Fiu bridge. And there is some support for China in Solomon Islands, with the superpower building the massive 2023 Pacific Games stadium and complex in Honiara and a new wing of the national university.Other major projects are planned.But in Malaita, those supporting China appear to be a small minority.The ABC spoke to dozens, and support for Mr Suidani's stance was almost universal. He says he has 80 per cent support across the island, but with its 200,000 inhabitants spread across some of the the most remote terrain in the world, that number is impossible to verify.  And its not just the older generation throwing their weight behind the Premier.Malaita Youth Council president Phillip Subu, an aspiring politician himself, said Malaitans had a history of ""resisting foreign infiltration"".He said China's trade relationship with the country was welcome and integral, but he said the country's political system ""wasn't ready"" for 'The Switch'.""One of the main concerns is we don't have very strong laws to protect our people's interests,"" Mr Subu says.  ""Even now, [they are] exploiting our economic system, exploiting our resources. ""When you come to Malaita you will see that we are quite peaceful people, we are loving people. ""But if one someone trespasses or steps over our land, we become very aggressive. And we shouldn't do something that spoils my land for future generations.""It's almost impossible to sleep in on July 7 in the capital Honiara. It's Independence Day, and at about 7:00am a convoy of cars plastered with Solomon Islands' flags stream down the pothole-littered main road, beeping incessantly.  Standing on the back of trucks, or poking their heads out of windows, the people scream ""happy Independence Day"" — and thousands lining the streets do the same. The convoy is headed towards the country's main hall to hear a ""15-minute reflection"" by Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, a yearly tradition. The ABC has tried multiple avenues to interview Mr Sogavare, but all have been ignored.  This is our only opportunity to hear him speak and ask questions.The speech is typical of Mr Sogavare. It's a sprawling 33-minute opus; emotional and stirring — he's one of the most talented orators in the Pacific, if not the world.In it, he singles out the country's ""new addition"" China for special thanks, saying it has demonstrated a ""genuine intention"" to be a ""worthy partner"" in the country's development.The Chinese ambassador, sitting next to the Australian High Commissioner, is watching on.  He talks about ""evil forces"" in the country, and noted the November riots, but at the same time calls for unity, telling the crowd to ""look inwards"". ""We have no external enemies, we are our own enemies,"" he said. ""All the major threats to destabilise this country have all been domestically driven.""God is watching us, and can read our motives like open books.""Mr Sogavare's minders promised the ABC an interview after the speech, but he was protected by police, and quickly whisked into a waiting car.In Auki, and much of Malaita, Independence Day is a muted celebration. Mr Suidani, wearing a green Solomon Islands shirt during our interview, says he still believes in ""one Solomon Islands"" — but his belief in ""democracy"" and ""freedom"" is just as strong. ""We've been waiting a long time for development in Malaita,"" he says.  ""And we want leaders who can address these things, who can build up our nation.""But if the trend of how the government is addressing issues continues, [not] listening to the will of the people, I think this issue of self-determination [in places like Malaita] will continue. ""No one wants to live under a government that doesn't care for people.""  The bridge is still out for tender.Reporting, digital production and additional photography: Nick SasPhotography and videography: Luke Bowden","China, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, International Aid and Trade, Solomon Islands, Urban Development and Planning, World Politics, ",2022-07-10T19:18:50+00:00
90,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-07-17/chinese-influence-solomon-islands/101242214,"It's no mistake Solomon Islands are also known as the Hapi Isles.They laugh like no one else, ""storying"" with each other in their hundreds of languages across a nation spread across nine diverse provinces and almost 1,000 islands.But, of late, the Hapi Isles has been struck by a fair bit of anger.On a walk around Honiara, it's easy to see why.The roads have endless potholes. Rubbish is everywhere. Many live in squalor, leaving their simple village lives in search of a better one in the capital.And many people, particularly young people, are still searching.More than 70 per cent of Solomon Islands' population is under the age of 35.And though there are countless young Solomon Islanders doing incredible things for their country and their communities, others are struggling.They're bored. They chew the local stimulant betel nut, drink ""kwaso"", the illegal home brew, and get into trouble. They do drugs and steal.And sometimes they riot. In November, angry mobs — most of them young men — torched buildings in Honiara's Chinatown.The reasons for the riots are broad and complex. Some say it was mainly political, a response to Prime Minister Mannaseh Sogavare's deal with China after ""The Switch"" from Taiwan, which in turn led to the secretive security pact that shook Australia and the world.Others say it is a more domestic political issue, a response to the central government not listening to them.And then there are the hyper-domestic social issues. As one prominent local businessman told me:""Youth unemployment here is horrendous,"" he said. ""We don't have a strong enough local economy to provide jobs.""We need that to help them see a future — that's a major reason why the riots happened — these young people are angry, they don't see a future here.""Despite all the domestic problems — and the other 'C' word: climate change — it's impossible not to mention China in the same breath as Solomon Islands these days.The ABC was the first international news crew to enter the country for more than two years, and the superpower's influence there hits you immediately.Just five minutes from the airport, the new stadium complex is spurting up from the ground with large Chinese flags and ""China Aid"" signs plastered all over it.Next door to that, a new wing of Solomon Islands national university is being built — again by China. There are provinces resisting its charge but in the capital, the train has well and truly left the station. It's a catch-22 for the country.On one hand, it's getting global attention. But it's predominantly for the wrong reasons.No doubt its enigmatic leader Sogavare is enjoying the spotlight.And worryingly when it comes to transparency, the man Solomon Islanders call ""Soga"" appears to heading down the ""China way"" of doing things.He has declined repeated requests from the ABC for interviews, and local media say he is becoming less and less available, surrounded by security and local police.Last week it was revealed SIBC, the country's national broadcaster celebrating its 70th birthday this year, will no longer be a state-owned enterprise and will instead get its money directly from the government.It has sparked fears that the independence of the broadcaster will be stripped away, morphing it into a mouthpiece for the government.""We never thought we'd see this day,"" veteran Solomon Islands journalist Dorothy Wickham told ABC Radio.""We want every citizen [to] say what they want and share and debate issues important to the country.""Journalists don't work for Sogavare, they work for SIBC — and SIBC belongs to Solomon Islands.""These days the Chinese Communist Party’s tentacles are entwined in the local media's coverage of Solomon Islands.   During the ABC’s short time in the country there was a front-page story about the benefits of Chinese police training local mining employees in self-defence.Another described a meeting between the premier of Guadalcanal (where Honiara sits) and US Government representatives as an example of “falling under the weight of pressure from Western Allies [sic] to ignore China’s timely development in Solomon Islands”.Interestingly, when Foreign Minister Penny Wong visited last month, the Australian High Commission Solomon Islands paid for SIBC to follow her around for the day.Local media say Wong stopped for a doorstop and answered every question the local media threw at her.When China's foreign minister toured the country, local media were given one question — to their own foreign minister.It led the local media association to boycott the press conference.Sogavare met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in Fiji on Wednesday at the Pacific Islands Forum, with both men calling it a ""constructive meeting"" – Mr Sogavare even asking for a hug.He has repeatedly said there would be no Chinese military base in the country and said it again this week.Ignoring the politics for a moment, the Australian aid program does a lot of heavy lifting in Solomon Islands — it's the country's biggest aid donor.Australia gave $171 million to Solomon Islands in 2020-21. And in the period from 2009 to 2019, Australia’s aid represented almost two-thirds of all aid to Solomon Islands, followed by New Zealand (9 per cent), Japan (6 per cent) and Taiwan (5 per cent).Australia has backed country-changing projects such as the Tina River Hydro Scheme, which will go live in the next year or two, and paid for the subsea internet cable.Then there's the plethora of health programs, governance training and funding of dozens of other behind-the-scenes programs.Sure, the aid program has been wound back — and it deservedly has its critics — but one of the superficial issues is that the Australian programs aren't headline-grabbing. Health programs and governance training aren’t as exciting as martial arts training.China’s contributions have ramped up in more recent years and are generally flashier — like a sparkling new stadium that everyone in the city can see (worth $66 million) or a new wing of the university (worth $33 million).I was lucky enough to spend a year in Solomon Islands in 2017, working with SIBC through the Australian Volunteers Program — another aid project funded by the Australian government (that will hopefully be re-booted after COVID forced most volunteers home).During the ABC's trip, I caught up with a few Solomon Islander friends I made during that time.We drank a few coconuts, had ""kaikai"" (food) and ""storied"" about the future direction of the wonderful Hapi Isles.But inevitably there was one word that we kept coming back to: China. ""I worry,"" one of my friends said.""I love my country, but I worry about this path. I worry about the direction we're headed.""","Australia, China, Climate Change, International Aid and Trade, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-07-16T19:00:00+00:00

We will continue to closely monitor the situation,"" the embassy said.The US Coast Guard vessel, Oliver Henry, was on patrol for illegal fishing in the South Pacific for a regional fisheries agency when it failed to obtain entry to refuel at Honiara, the Solomons' capital, a US Coast Guard press officer said in an emailed statement on Friday.A US State Department spokesperson said the ""lack of diplomatic clearance for the Oliver Henry was regrettable"", and the US was pleased the Mercy had received clearance.The Mercy's humanitarian mission, together with personnel from Australia and Japan, will include community health outreach, engineering projects and discussions on disaster relief.Separately, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said it was regrettable that ""we've seen the Chinese try to bully and coerce nations throughout the Indo-Pacific to do their bidding and to serve what they believe their selfish national security interests are, rather than the broader interests of a free and open Indo-Pacific"".ABC/Reuters","Australia, China, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Navy, New Zealand, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, United Kingdom, United States, World Politics, ",2022-08-30T06:18:31+00:00

But I'm uneasy about how it came about and where we're going as a country.""There's a lot of self-interest at play here.""This situation we're in, I never thought it would happen.""The small island nation of Solomon Islands was unexpectedly thrust into the centre of a geopolitical storm in April when it signed a secret security pact with China.The pact sparked concern in Australia and across much of the Western world that China would leverage its power to build a military base in the country — speculation that both China and Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare have since denied.The security pact itself is an extension of Mr Sogavare's 2019 decision to change the country's diplomatic allegiances from Taiwan to China — a move known as  ""The Switch"" in Honiara.The decision was a source of simmering tension in the country, culminating in violence and rioting in November last year, with many demanding Mr Sogavare stand down. Angry mobs later torched buildings in Honiara's Chinatown.The Solomon Islands' border opened on Friday, allowing international media to gain access to the country for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Almost nine months after the riots, the damage from the civil unrest is still visible.Parts of the once-bustling Chinatown still resemble a war zone, with burnt-out buildings and political graffiti sprayed over the buildings. Members of the Australian Federal Police and Australian Defence Force were sent in at the time to help quell the violence, and a small number still remain in Honiara.However, their presence is not outwardly visible around town, with the ABC only spotting army personnel at a local cafe. Chinese forces — although again not patrolling the streets or outwardly visible — have been training local police and prison personnel in ""China-style"" military exercises, which culminated in a graduating ceremony on Friday.In an address to the graduates, which local media was not invited to attend, Solomon Islands Prime Minister praised the Chinese training, saying it would ""greatly assist"" the nation's police and prison staff to respond riots and maintain ""public order"".  ""The recent November riots have cost us $SBD800 million ($150 million),"" the Prime Minister said. ""One thousand people lost their jobs.""The cost to rebuild our town is another challenge we will have to face. ""All for what? All for nothing.[The] riots have put us back as a country. We cannot develop and progress if we continue to take law into our own hands."" The ABC has put in a request to speak to Mr Sogavare. Solomon Islands is a deeply religious country, and one man who knows and understands the consciousness of the people better than most is archbishop Chris Cardone.   The archbishop, who has been based in Honiara for 32 years, attributes the November riots to ""certain problems"" with government and corruption. Speaking to the ABC after Sunday mass at his chapel, which is a stone's throw from the scene of the riots, he said youth unemployment in the country was also a major issue and cause of the discontent.  ""And many of [those issues] have not been really addressed,"" Archbishop Cardone said.""So I'd say we're happy to have the athletic and sporting facilities, but I'd say there's a certain apprehension [about the relationship with China] in the town of Honiara and many of the provincial capitals.""Australia remains the Solomon Islands' biggest aid donor, funding a multitude of projects across the country.However the relationship soured during Australia's recent federal election campaign when the security deal was leaked on social media, with the Honiara-Canberra relationship becoming a political football in Australia. It triggered an outburst from Mr Sogavare, who accused the then-Morrison government of hypocrisy over its criticism of the China deal.Despite the recent tension, insiders say Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong's recent trip to Honiara has helped smooth out some of the recent bumps, with both sides committing to more open dialogue.    Despite the semantics, tension remains high.  One local prominent business owner, who said he would lose business if he spoke publicly, said China was becoming increasingly active in Solomon Islands, with ""direct conversations"" about increasing trade opportunities happening regularly in Honiara.There is also a push for direct flights from Honiara to mainland China. He said there was a danger Australia would be ""left behind"" for China, which was Solomon Islands number one trading partner, unless it became more active in addressing issues such as increasing trade, youth unemployment and visa issues.""When Solomon Islanders apply for visas into Australia, we're treated as if we're second-class citizens,"" he said.  ""And then we have ships that arrive here from Brisbane, but they go back empty.  ""We have produce like ginger and the best coconuts and pineapples, but when I go into Woolies in Australia, they're from countries like the Philippines."" The ABC contacted the Australian High Commission Solomon Islands for comment.  The country itself is incredibly unique and diverse, spread across six major islands and 900 smaller islands almost 1,000 kilometres apart.And with 80 per cent of the country's population living in remote and regional areas, it is almost impossible to gauge the true feelings of the nation.  But if you ask someone in Honiara for the best place to feel the pulse of the city, there's only one answer: the market.The ABC spent a morning asking market sellers and shoppers what they thought about the China pact and where the country was headed.  Some did not know about it, saying they were more concerned about putting food on the table.Flower seller Florence Sabo had mixed feelings, saying other countries had made ""The Switch"" and were OK. She said she was hopeful the government was making the right decisions on her behalf.""But I'm not so sure they are,"" Ms Sabo said.The majority of market-goers, like fish seller Peter Chaniel, were against the deal.""I don’t think it's much good for the people of Solomon Islands,"" he said. ""I don't think it brings any benefit to people in the outer islands of the country. It's not a good look for us [to be associated with China].Back outside the stadium, Ashley Wickham was a little more direct.""I was flabbergasted,"" he said. ""The security pact was secretive, it was undemocratic, and the arrogance of the decision was astounding.""I personally don't think our government deserves to be in power anymore.""It's going to be very hard to turn it around.

""It will be amazing to see my family again.""She said the government's decision to scrap quarantine was an ""added bonus"".Anyone entering Solomon Islands was set to endure six days quarantine, but that was then reduced to three days.This week, the government scrapped quarantine altogether, only requiring full COVID vaccination and a negative PCR test 72 hours prior to travel. Tourism is still a small sector for the Solomon Islands economy, with 28,000 international visitors coming in 2019 before COVID took hold. It pales in comparison to nearby Fiji, which welcomed just short of 900,000 visitors in 2019. Nearby Vanuatu, which welcomes 250,000 international arrivals in 2019, also opened its borders on Friday, for the first time since March 2020.In Honiara, local businesses were eagerly awaiting the arrival of tourists for the first time in years. Betty Solobol, a market vendor operating opposite the Honiara Airport terminal, said she had mixed reactions about the border reopening. ""I'm happy because the past two years, I keep seeing people arriving into Solomon Islands go past my market in [government] enclosed vehicles,"" she said. ""But today I'm happy because I don't have to see that — they are free.""At the same time, I'm still afraid that the government has re-opened the borders because we will be exposed to COVID-19 and other sickness.""","Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, International Aid and Trade, Solomon Islands, Tourism and Leisure Industry, Travel and Tourism (Lifestyle and Leisure), ",2022-07-01T00:14:10+00:00

97,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-24/pacific-snubs-us-china-for-leaders-meeting/101178970,"The Pacific's peak diplomatic body looks set to exclude the United States, China and several other major countries from a crucial leaders meeting in Fiji next month in a move that could help shelter the gathering from intensifying geostrategic competition buffeting the region.The Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders meeting is due to be held in Fiji's capital Suva in mid-July.Australia is a full member of the forum and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has already declared he will attend.In recent decades PIF has also held a separate in-person meeting with Dialogue Partners during the Leaders' Week.The forum has 21 partners, including the United States, China, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Canada, India, Singapore and the United Kingdom.But the ABC has been told that this year the in-person Dialogue Partners meeting will not be held during the forum leaders gathering in Suva.It will likely be held separately later this year, although it's also possible that PIF will propose a virtual meeting for Dialogue Partners that week.Either way, officials and politicians from countries outside the region will effectively be locked out of the in-person meeting in Suva, where Pacific Island leaders are set to grapple with a range of complex and fraught strategic issues.One Pacific Island source said that officials — as well as the current PIF chair, Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama — were keen to ensure that Pacific leaders had ""space"" to resolve issues and decide on their key priorities without having to simultaneously navigate meetings with powerful outside players jostling for influence.A second Pacific source confirmed Dialogue Partners wouldn't be invited to Suva, but said the decision wasn't aimed at reducing geopolitical tensions surrounding the meeting.Instead, they said Mr Bainimarama wanted to make it easier for Pacific Island leaders to focus on key internal issues, including efforts to heal a painful rift over the leadership of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat.Leaders in Suva will be asked to endorse a sensitive agreement that Mr Bainimarama helped negotiate, which will rotate the PIF Secretary-General position between subregions in order to stop Micronesian nations splitting from the forum.The meeting in Suva is also significant because it will offer all Pacific leaders the chance for their first face-to-face gathering since the 2019 PIF meeting in Tuvalu, when Scott Morrison clashed with his Pacific counterparts over climate change.Leaders will have to confront several sensitive geopolitical questions when they meet.Australia has already flagged it wants the meeting to discuss the security pact that Solomon Islands has signed with China, which Canberra fears will open the door to a Chinese military presence down the track.Samoa's Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mataʻafa has also said that she would like the forum to discuss China's contentious push for a region-wide agreement with 10 Pacific states.China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi tried unsuccessfully to convince several Pacific Island countries to sign up to the pact during his sprawling tour of the Pacific last month.Solomon Islands has publicly backed the agreement, but other Pacific Island leaders have warned it could spark a new Cold War in the region and undermine the sovereignty of Pacific states.On top of that, they'll discuss a draft ""Blue Pacific"" 2050 strategy and Vanuatu's push to get the International Court of Justice to issue an advisory opinion on climate change.While partner countries have not always sent senior officials or leaders to the PIF leaders meeting, some high-profile players have attended in the past – including then-US secretary of state Hilary Clinton, who attended the 2012 gathering in Cook Islands.The dialogue partner meetings have sometimes also been eventful.In 2018 the then-chair of PIF, Nauru's President Baron Waqa, clashed angrily with a Chinese official who then stormed out of the room.Tess Newton Cain from the Griffith Asia Institute's Pacific Hub said the move to keep the top level meeting focused on member states would ""largely be welcomed"" in the Pacific.""It removes a degree of distraction and means that the leaders can focus on their deliberations and decision-making about some really critical issues,"" she said.""It will allow for them to focus on their agenda without expectations or pressures to meet dialogue partners inside events.""As we know they will spend a whole day in retreat where the 'big' talking happens.""But there will be many pre and side conversations in the lead-up to that and this gives everyone a bit more space, and to an extent, privacy to work.""The ABC contacted the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat for comment, but it declined to respond.The President of the Federated States of Micronesia, David Panuelo, told ABC News that the move

And if they can make them happy, who knows what's going to happen next.""Ms Kinai isn't the only member of Australia's Pacific islander community feeling unnerved by all the sudden attention on the region.The diplomatic visits have been dominating headlines, but media access is heavily restricted and a lot of information is being fed through high-level statements and press conferences. Many repeat claims from Beijing that its intentions in the region are based on ""mutual respect"".""I think it's confusing. That's why I am scared. I don't know what's happening,"" Ms Kinai said. Melbourne resident Nancy Fugui is also finding the situation daunting. Ms Fugui is from Solomon Islands, where her government signed a controversial security pact with China in April.She believes Solomon Island's closer relationship with China will inevitably lead to the country being exploited. ""China is a very big country and the Pacific Islands, most of us are small countries with small populations,"" she said. ""It's unpredictable what China has in mind. But lately, we believe that they want to get their hands on our resources and I don't think most of us are happy with that.""Ms Fugui wants Australia to have a stronger presence in the country, saying that prior to the pact with China the government had only engaged with the Solomons ""bit by bit"".""But our recent government wanted more, so they asked China,"" she said.Beijing has said the deal would involve China cooperating with Honiara on maintaining social order, combating natural disasters and safeguarding national security.""I don't know why our government brought in police from China. It's not good,"" Ms Fugui said. ""Our country is really vulnerable at this moment with security, with resources. We don't know what's going to happen in five years' time."" The Chinese Foreign Minister held a virtual meeting with a host of countries in Fiji on Monday with the aim to strike a sweeping trade and security agreement with 10 Pacific Island nations.The proposal was shelved after a number of Pacific countries raised concerns about both the substance of the pact and China's approach.However, Beijing remains confident in its ambitions in region.It has signalled it will press ahead with negotiations after releasing a position paper that omitted several key components of the initial proposal. Chinese state media has been heavily covering Mr Wang's visit, playing down the setback and accusing Australia of trying to ""drive a wedge between China and regional countries"".The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also recently created an account on Weibo – China's largest social media site – called ""Broad Pacific,"" which provides updates on Mr Wang's tour to the region.None of the posts to the more than 17,000 followers have reported that China was unable to get the desired ""Common Development Vision"" regional agreement across the line. ""We look forward to a successful demonstration of cooperation between China and Fiji,"" one follower commented.Another said: ""Everything we do is for economic construction, nothing else.""Beijing resident Billy Wu said he wasn't paying much attention to Mr Wang's Pacific visit until discussions on social media became more heated in recent days.""South Pacific Island countries, I believe, feel too far away for ordinary Chinese people,"" he told the ABC. He has little knowledge of the region, but sees why there would be concern given that many Pacific Island countries have experienced colonialism. ""These island countries are now vulnerable to another type of economic colonisation. I think it's understandable that the locals are worried about it [China's influence],"" he said. Senator Wong headed back to the Pacific on Wednesday to meet with leaders in Samoa and Tonga ""to renew and strengthen Australia's deep ties of friendship and family"".Tonya Toi, a Tongan Australian based in Melbourne, is glad there is finally focus on the region, saying it had been ""totally neglected"". Ms Toi is the president and wellbeing officer at the Pasifika Community of Australia (PCA) – a non-for-profit organisation she founded with Ms Kinai in 2020 to support the community during COVID. It is not a political organisation, but after seeing the growing influence of China across the Pacific they began raising the community's security concerns with the government.""I've been here more than 30 years in Australia and we were feeling nervous,"" Ms Toi told the ABC.""We need to have a bit more attention on our Pacific nations.""One of Ms Toi's main concerns is the lack of transparency around aid and funding in Tonga, particularly after the volcanic eruption and tsunami earlier this year that devastated much of the country. She also worries about China's intentions and the possibility of individual governments to be swayed by money. ""We know they [China] have other hidden agendas,"" Ms Toi said.""Individual government leaders see the other side, but unfortunately they may be attracted to that.""She said although Australia had wasted time, she was confident that the government's current momentum would continue. ""I trust that this government will make a move as we have witnessed and stay at it.""","Asia, China, Defence Forces, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Treaties and Alliances, World Politics, ",2022-06-02T18:54:58+00:00
99,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-01/china-foreign-minister-pacific-visit-analysis/101116656,"Henry Puna has had a torrid time of it recently. Last year, the former Cook Islands Prime Minister won a tightly contested and acrimonious ballot to take on the leadership of the Pacific's top regional body, the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), and promptly found himself in the middle of a political hurricane.PIF split apart almost immediately, leading to laborious and often painful negotiations as Pacific officials — with assistance from Australia and New Zealand — try to salve wounded egos and hammer out a compromise that will keep Micronesian countries in the big tent.The secretary-general's fate is likely to be finally resolved — one way or another — at the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting, which is loosely pegged to be held in the middle of next month, in Suva.Micronesian leaders have already publicly declared they expect him to walk away from the job and hand it over to one of their candidates, which leaves Puna publicly humiliated and exposed.But if Puna is a dead man walking, he did not look like that this week.In fact, he looked very much like a man with something urgent to say.The stage was a big one. Late on Saturday, all eyes swivelled to Suva as China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi landed in Fiji's capital, his fourth stop on an island-hopping tour covering no fewer than eight Pacific Island countries.His trip came the same week as new Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong touched down in Fiji and pledged to listen to Pacific leaders. She revealed she would be heading back to the Pacific on Wednesday night, meeting with leaders in Samoa and Tonga ""to renew and strengthen Australia's deep ties of friendship and family"" and to discuss what further help Australia can offer to Tonga after a disastrous underwater volcanic explosion earlier this year.Wang's first publicly advertised engagement was with Mr Puna at the PIF Secretariat the next day.The visit had a somewhat perfunctory air. China is a Dialogue Partner with PIF, but the brute reality is that Beijing is impatient to bypass the regional organisation, and has moved quickly to set up its own direct dialogue with all Pacific Island countries it has ties with.China talks a lot about consensus, but has done very little to seek it.Right now, its diplomats are in a hurry, with no time for navigating the careful (sometimes torturous) processes of negotiation and consensus building at the core of PIF.So it was hard to escape the feeling that Wang's Sunday PIF stop off was a bit of a courtesy call, a polite nod to Pacific regionalism before the Foreign Minister got down to the real business of meeting with Fiji's Prime Minister and regional heavyweight Frank Bainimarama, as well as playing host and impresario for the second China-Pacific Island Countries Foreign Ministers' Meeting.The Chinese officials shepherding Wang through the Secretariat certainly weren't treading carefully.When they saw the ABC's cameraman positioned to film the greeting, they objected loudly and angrily, arguing the visit was limited to Chinese and Fijian media only.One minder even placed herself directly in front of the ABC's camera.PIF's impressive media representative, Lisa Williams-Lahari, (not a woman who is easily intimidated) had to rather forcefully remind them that they were visitors rather than hosts, and that PIF — not China — was setting the rules for media.Fijian journalists also backed in the ABC in an impressive display of solidarity.But the tension among Chinese government minders didn't dissipate after the Foreign Minister arrived.When Wang sat down in one of the secretariat's beautiful timber meeting rooms, he nodded politely to Puna, smiled briefly at the gathered cameras and paused, seemingly waiting for them to depart the room.But before they left, Puna had something he wanted to say.Instead of delivering pleasantries, the PIF secretary-general laid out three ""key issues"" that would be at the core of their discussions.""Firstly, urgent and ambitious climate change action,"" he said, with cameras rolling.""Our forum leaders have identified climate change as the single greatest threat facing our Blue Pacific region.""Action to keep our world below 1.5 degrees is vital for the future prosperity and wellbeing of our region.""This is a message Puna has delivered time and time again to all major countries and big polluters, including Australia. It is not one reserved for China alone.But putting it directly to the Foreign Minister of the world's largest carbon emitter in front of a live television feed was still a pointed bit of political messaging.Chinese officials — perhaps expecting nothing more than an anodyne welcome statement and bland formalities — were clearly not happy.The ABC filmed some of them gesticulating and complaining to PIF staff after media left the room.It wasn't the only time in Suva that things didn't go perfectly to plan for Wang and the Chinese foreign affairs officials following in his wake.Much has already been written about China shelving — for now — its contentious ""Common Development Vision"" regional agreement.The draft text was leaked less than a week before Wang's meeting with foreign ministers, presumably by someone intent on spiking it.Chinese officials had clearly been instructed to try and get the sweeping pact over the line ahead of Wang's flagship meeting with Pacific foreign ministers, handing Beijing an emphatic (and very public) diplomatic victory while potentially reshaping the region's strategic contours.They poured considerable time and energy into rushing it through.But this is not how Pacific diplomacy usually works.You catch brief glimpses of the diplomatic strain this caused in the carefully weighed statements from some Pacific Island leaders.Samoa's Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa said rather pointedly that, ""We have not made a decision [on the pact] as we did not have enough time to look at it.""In other words: This is important. We are not beholden to your timetable. Don't rush us.Australia and the United States will hardly be celebrating — Beijing has signalled it will press ahead with negotiations and it seems determined to land the agreement in one shape or another.But they still see clear signs of over-reach from China.One Western official told the ABC that quite a few Pacific Island nations had reservations about the pact and that several foreign ministers in the gathering didn't want it on the meeting agenda at all.""When it was leaked, it was dead. It was probably dead before that,"" they told the ABC.Prime Minister Fiamē has even suggested that the Pacific Island Forum may be best body to discuss China's proposal, in the spirit of Pacific unity.China will resist that at all costs.Among PIF's members are four Pacific nations that recognise Taiwan rather than Beijing.Australia and New Zealand are also PIF members, and it's safe to assume they'd throw all their energies into sinking the pact.That explains why some analysts are predicting that if the whole debate lands in PIF's lap it will inevitably become the agreement's graveyard.But for now, this is speculation.We don't know if other Pacific Island countries would be happy to handball this particular hot potato to PIF.We don't even yet have a clear idea of what they said to Wang Yi about the pact when they sat down with him on Monday.In fact, the only public statement from a Pacific Islands representative who attended the meeting has come from the office of — you guessed it — Henry Puna.And once again, it makes for interesting reading.The secretary-general made a rather jaundiced reference to the ""increasing intensity, of geopolitical manoeuvring in our region today"" and the ""recent influx of high-level visits to our Blue Pacific"". ""Many of these partnerships are not new,"" the transcript reads, ""but have been re-invigorated in recent years, often in direct response to geo-political positioning.""That's aimed as much at the United States — which is hurriedly reopening its embassy in Solomon Islands as Beijing forges new security links with Honiara — as it is at China.But Puna also seized the chance to remind Beijing that sidestepping his organisation — while racing to build new commercial and security connections throughout the Blue Pacific — risks opening new fault-lines in a region already grappling with mounting challenges.""Being a Forum Dialogue Partner is not without its own expectations and responsibilities,"" the transcript reads.""The chief among which, is to nurture a relationship that is respectful of our shared values, built on joint collaboration and partnership, works with and through our regional mechanisms and progresses mutually agreed priorities.""And the intensifying contest for power and influence in the Pacific means that countries — ""including China"" have to place ""increasing value [on] our collective ability to think, live, engage and deliver, as one Blue Pacific region"". Yes, it's carefully worded. But the message is unmistakable.Henry Puna may, or may not, be heading for the door soon. But either way, he's not quite done yet.  ","China, Fiji, International Aid and Trade, Kiribati, National Security, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2022-06-01T06:08:23+00:00
100,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-05-31/china-pushing-pacific-island-nations-regional-agreement/101112074,"China's government says it remains confident it can strike a sweeping trade and security agreement with 10 Pacific Island states despite being forced to shelve its proposed agreement.Beijing has since released a position paper on the Pacific, but several key components of the draft deal — including free trade, joint police efforts and cybersecurity measures — are omitted from the document. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with 10 Pacific counterparts on Monday, less than a week after a copy of the Common Development Vision agreement was leaked to the press.The proposal stoked controversy among Pacific Island nations, with Federated States of Micronesia President David Panuelo warning it could stoke geopolitical confrontations in the region and undermine the sovereignty of Pacific countries.On Monday, China's ambassador to Fiji confirmed some Pacific nations had ""concerns"" about some ""issues"" in the agreement and said Beijing would try to seek consensus from them.But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian played down the significance of the pause when asked about it by journalists in Beijing.""As for the joint document you mentioned, it involves an ongoing process of discussion,"" he said.""Not every meeting has to issue a joint document.""At the foreign ministers' meeting this time, all parties reached new consensus on this, making an important step towards reaching the final agreement.""The parties agreed to continue to engage in active and practical discussions in order to build more consensus.""Separately, the state-owned tabloid Global Times appeared to take aim at Mr Panuelo for blocking the agreement, saying ""a few people"" in the Pacific ""under the pressure and coercion of the US and former coloniser may be willing to serve American interests at the cost of their national and people's interests"".However, an increasing number of Pacific Island leaders have now raised concerns about both the substance of the pact, and the way China seemingly tried to push through the agreement ahead of Mr Wang's meeting on Monday.Samoa's Prime Minister, Fiame Naomi Mata'afa, suggested during a press conference on Monday that her country had been rushed by China, saying: ""We have not made a decision [about the agreement] as we did not have enough time to look at it.""Diplomatic sources told the ABC that Fiji had indicated to China ahead of the meeting it would not be able to secure an agreement because some Pacific Island nations had reservations about its impact.But they also stressed that China had not abandoned the pact and Beijing would now likely redouble efforts to convince Pacific Island nations to sign it.Anna Powles from Massey University said while Chinese officials had adopted the ""language"" of consensus, they ""clearly haven't put it into practice so far"".""The outcome shows that there was clear resistance to the deal on the part of Pacific leaders due to concerns about substance and the process by which Beijing sought to have it adopted,"" Dr Powles told the ABC.""Adopting consensus in the current environment is going to be challenging given publicly stated concerns from FSM (Federated States of Micronesia) and Palau as well as Niue.""The Samoan leader also suggested the issue could be raised at the next Pacific Islands Forum leaders' meeting, which is likely to be held in July.Dr Powles said discussing the issue at the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) would be ""challenging"" because four PIF nations still recognised Taiwan rather than China.""Taking the deal to the PIF may be an attempt to derail it completely,"" she said.After the multi-country deal was shelved, China's ambassador to Fiji signalled Beijing would release a ""position paper"" on the Pacific.On Tuesday, China's Embassy in the US published the 15-point statement, but the paper made no mention of free trade or joint policing, and only a fleeting reference to cybersecurity cooperation, which were key features of the leaked draft deal.There was scant reference to climate change action — which Pacific leaders have repeatedly flagged is a key concern and existential threat to their low-lying countries.""Geopolitical point-scoring means less than little to anyone whose community is slipping beneath the rising seas,"" Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said in a joint press conference with Mr Wang on Monday.The paper proposed appointing a Chinese government special envoy for Pacific Island Countries affairs, as well as encouraging and supporting airlines to launch flights between China and Pacific countries when COVID-19 is under control.It called for respecting the ""independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pacific Island countries, support Pacific Island countries in independently choosing development paths suited to their national conditions, adhere to non-interference in internal affairs"".""Appreciate that Pacific Island countries firmly abide by the one-China principle, and understand and support China's core interests and major concerns,"" the paper read.On security, it referred to upholding the ""international non-proliferation regime with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as its cornerstone and support the development of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone"", as well as combating transnational crime, including cyber-crime, and jointly tackling ""non-traditional security threats"".It proposed injecting an additional $US2 million ($2.7 million) into a COVID-19 fund, sending Chinese medical teams to Pacific countries, including Solomon Islands and Kiribati.It also suggested holding seminars on agriculture, trade, technology, disaster mitigation, governance, as well as training diplomats, providing 2,500 government scholarships, and establishing a poverty reduction centre.The paper referenced supporting ""willing institutions"" to establish Confucius Institutes and classrooms with China, as well as exploring cultural cooperation. ","Asia, China, Defence Forces, Fiji, Foreign

conferences and media access heavily restricted, highlighting the growing threat to journalism in the region. For Peter Greste — the director for the Alliance of Journalists' Freedom and a professor of journalism at Macquarie University — what has played out during the visit to the region was troubling but not particularly surprising.""What we've seen in this particular trip is the latest and perhaps the more extreme version of a trend that we're seeing play out in the Solomon Islands, in Fiji, and across the region,"" Professor Greste said.""What is, I think, really concerning is the way in which a lot of countries across the Pacific region have been adopting some of the more authoritarian tendencies of China, to control the flow of information.""Details about Mr Wang's trip, which was aimed at signing Pacific nations up to a range of security and trade deals, have been scarce and journalists' interactions with officials have at times been tense.In Fiji on Monday, Chinese officials attempted to block an ABC camera operator from filming a meet and greet between Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) secretary-general Henry Puna and Mr Wang.""I watched as Chinese government media and Chinese officials tried to stand in the way of this cameraman so they wouldn't be able to do their work,"" senior Fijian journalist and ABC freelancer Lice Movono said.""Thankfully, the forum secretariat were very vocal in their insistence that they would not suppress the media, that they would allow the Pacific media to conduct itself in the way that free media does.""During a regular media address on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministery spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the allegations were nothing but ""smears against China"".""I can tell you that the allegations are completely inconsistent with facts,"" he said.""As to which media are invited and how many journalists are allowed into the venue, I suppose they are decided by the host country based on customary practice and the size of the venue.""China fully respects the arrangement of the host country.""I can tell you that the visit is smooth and successful, and there is no such thing as ""chaos"" or restriction"" claimed by the US.During Mr Wang's first leg of the trip, the Media Association of Solomon Islands (MASI) called on members to boycott a press conference after local and Chinese media were told they could collectively ask one question of their respective foreign minister ahead of a scheduled event.MASI board member and journalist Dorothy Wickham told the ABC there was no justification for the press conference restrictions, leaving journalists angry and disappointed.""I know our colleagues in Fiji face a problem such as restrictions on certain things and maybe also they do not feel free to speak up or even write on certain things,"" she said.""But in Solomon Islands, we've never had that problem and I am disappointed that our government is allowing itself to allow this.""I think [China is] expecting our government to keep certain things from the public and I think that's where they're making the wrong move,"" she said.While China has one of the world's most restrictive approaches to press freedom, Professor Greste cautioned against drawing a direct line between Beijing's stance and the trends playing out in the Pacific.""What we know is that the region has been moving closer to China in all sorts of ways and this trip was very clearly an attempt by China to cement its relationship and deepen its relationship across the region,"" he said.""At the same time, we're seeing a greater tendency by a lot of those regional states to clamp down on the flow of information and journalist access.""And we've seen a lot of attempts by governments to use punitive actions to control. ""It's hard to say that those two things are directly connected, that China is directly responsible for causing this or whether there's … soft influence or whether it's just simply a coincidence. ""Whatever is causing that trend, I think we need to start arguing very, very forcefully for reversal.""Issues of freedom of the press, censorship — and even self-censorship — have been simmering in the Pacific for some time. Dr Shailendra Singh from the University of the South Pacific said the transition to the internet and social media for news consumption had caused revenue from newspaper subscription fees to evaporate and made many local media businesses financially vulnerable.Pacific outlets sometimes rely on government advertising to support their enterprises, which Dr Singh says threatens the editorial independence of media.According to Reporters without Borders (RSF), authorities in Fiji — the worst-performing country for press freedom in the Pacific on the World Press Freedom index — use ""discriminatory"" advertising practices to blackmail media outlets considered critical of the government.RSF said the country's vaguely worded media laws had created ""a climate of fear and self-censorship"".""The connection between political and economic power is very tight and the influence of the economic power over the editorial team … makes it quite difficult for journalists to publish some stories,"" RSF Asia-Pacific director Daniel Bastard saidAustralia's place in the press freedom index has also taken a hit, dropping from 25 to 39 in 2022.""Australia needs to be very careful about getting too preachy, when it comes to press freedom … we've got all sorts of very, very restrictive national security laws which undermine the ability of journalists to do their jobs,"" Professor Greste said.""And while we don't necessarily see journalists being locked up in prison, the law is having its intended effect, and that's acting as a deterrent.""Additionally, Dr Graeme Smith from the Australian National University's Department of Pacific Affairs noted that the limits placed on journalists during Mr Wang's time in Fiji were not so different from when former prime minister Scott Morrison did not invite media with him to flood-affected areas in northern New South Wales earlier this year.""They don't want surprises, they don't want embarrassment and they like these things to be highly scripted affairs,"" Dr Smith said, adding that the media blockout was not specific to the Pacific trip.In 2019, the Melanesia Media Freedom Forum released a statement raising concerns that the threat to media freedom in the Pacific was increasing.It pointed to concerns about restrictive legislation and an unwillingness from politicians to respond to journalists' questions.It also highlighted issues faced by female journalists in the region, who often struggle to get responses from people in authority and face threats to their safety, including sexual harassment, according to the statement. COVID-19 has inflicted another major setback for media freedom. Governments have used the pandemic to justify further curtailing the media, according to Dr Singh.Journalists in Vanuatu, for example, were not allowed to publish coronavirus stories without government approval.And in Fiji, a military leader penned an op-ed in the Fiji Sun in 2020 defending the government's move to ""stifle criticism"" of coronavirus policies.Dr Smith said while some forms of China's media engagement in the Pacific were welcome, he said the country was adopting ""cruder"" methods of engagement with Pacific media.Under Chinese President Xi Jinping's leadership, China has been trying to deepen engagement with Pacific journalists by sponsoring study tours to China and fostering stronger ties with cash-strapped media organisations.But Dr Smith said Beijing's efforts were often in the hope of pushing a more positive image of China abroad.""If it's done in a way that is kind of sneaky and back door rather than openly advertising for scholarships, then I think it crosses a line,"" Dr Smith said.Australia also has programs to engage with Pacific media, including a project to build capacity of Pacific journalists — funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and managed by the ABC — as well as the $17.1 million PacificAus TV initiative, which provides free Australian television programming to Pacific broadcasters.","Australia, China, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Kiribati, Media Industry, Pacific, Politics and Government, Samoa,

102,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-08/snapshot-of-china-involvment-in-the-pacific/101106904,"China's presence in the Pacific has been thrown into the spotlight following a controversial pact with Solomon Islands. It was followed by an island-hopping tour by China's Foreign Minister to shore up support for a sweeping deal with several nations, a leaked draft of which included security and policing. While the deal has been shelved for now, Foreign Minister Wang Yi signed a raft of agreements with individual countries — but the details have not been made public. But Beijing's involvement in the Pacific is nothing new.For years, China has been building its presence in the region, inking deals on everything from airport runways, roads and stadiums to education and fishing.Beijing scored significant diplomatic victories in 2019, when Solomon Islands and Kiribati switched their diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China.Palau, Nauru, Tuvalu and Marshall Islands still maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan.China's growth and its ambitious foreign policy, including Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects in the Pacific, have seen fresh funding for infrastructure flow to the region.Despite that, Australia remains the largest donor to the Pacific and China is becoming less generous. Some observers fear Beijing's aim is to fund infrastructure projects in key strategic locations that will later ""enable Chinese military access"" at air and sea ports.But others point out that several countries use money to gain power and influence and China's investment in roads, schools and hospitals also benefits those on the ground.Mr Wang last week highlighted that ""China is not a newcomer"" in this arena.""Some have been questioning why China has been so active in supporting Pacific Island countries,"" he said.""My advice for those people is don't be too anxious and don't be too nervous.""Here's a snapshot of the kind of work China has done in the 10 countries with which it shares diplomatic ties. While much attention has been paid to the leaked security pact with China which was signed in April, it's not the only agreement Solomon Islands has with the superpower. Soon after Solomon Islands switched recognition to China, Honiara signed six agreements with Beijing. This included a deal — leaked more than two years later — for one of China's largest defence and aerospace companies to upgrade almost three dozen airstrips in Solomon Islands, as part of an ambitious plan to transform the country into an ""aeronautical hub"" for the region.In exchange, Solomon Islands was to purchase six aircraft from a Chinese state-owned company, but it doesn't appear either side pushed ahead with the initiatives in the MOU after signing it. One project that is underway is the multi-million-dollar national sports stadium being bankrolled and built by Beijing in Honiara.Tess Newton Cain, from Griffith University's Pacific Hub, said the project was designed for Solomon Islands to host the 2023 Pacific Games. She said it was significant because the government was pinning its post-COVID economic recovery on the Games.""They are a real focus of national pride, economic activity … [and] tourism,"" she said. ""To say it's just a vanity project possibly betrays a lack of understanding as to how important those events are for Pacific countries themselves.""Details of other agreements between China and Solomon Islands, including those signed during Mr Wang's visit, aren't clear. The ABC has approached the Solomon Islands Ministry of Foreign Affairs and External Trade for comment.During Mr Wang's visit, Kiribati signed 10 documents to ""elevate cooperation"" on the BRI, climate change, livelihood projects, disaster risk reduction, road infrastructure, tourism, the dispatching of medical teams, COVID-19 supplies and marine transportation for the Line Islands.Additionally, Global Times, an English-language Chinese state media tabloid, reported cooperation agreements on trade, renewable energy and customs inspection were signed.The Kiribati government said it would release details of the visit later.When the Chinese delegation touched down in Kiribati last month, the atoll nation was focused on trade and tourism opportunities with China and was not keen on a security arrangement, according to a Kiribati official who was not authorised to speak to the media.While there had been much speculation over a controversial plan to reopen a protected marine zone for commercial fishing, and to upgrade a World War II-era airstrip on Canton Island, the official said these were not among the agreements due to be signed. Since switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in 2019, Kiribati has said it would open the 400,000 square-kilometre Phoenix Islands Protected Area — one of the world's largest marine conservation zones — to fishing.Western critics have expressed concern the Chinese plan to upgrade the airstrip would offer Beijing a foothold about 3,000km south-west of the US state of Hawaii. Kiribati said it would be a non-military project designed to bolster tourism. Papua New Guinea has had diplomatic ties with China since 1976, a year after becoming independent from Australia.It's the largest recipient of both Chinese and Australian aid.But some projects China has promised and not yet delivered.One is a $US4.1 billion ($5.7 billion) road project, which would upgrade 11 roads and connect all regions of the country.""If it eventuates, it would be the largest Chinese aid project in Pacific history,"" said the Lowy Institute's Alexandre Dayant.Another is the Ramu 2 hydropower plant, to which China has committed a potential $US920 million — if it goes ahead.""China's involvement in the Pacific through development support serves a double purpose,"" said Mr Dayant, who has mapped development funding flows in the Lowy Pacific Aid Map.""First, it answers a profound development need from the region … However, China's support isn't free and understanding its intent is important.""It is also important to mention that China isn't the only one using aid policies as leverage for favours. Australia's aid program, like New Zealand's and other western countries, often comes with strings attached.""Another aim of China's engagement in the region is to garner support on the world stage.Dr Newton Cain said investing in development needs meant China — and other donors — could build political capital when they wanted support at the United Nations, for example.In 2020, PNG backed China at the UN over its controversial national security law in Hong Kong.""It would be naive to think that China does this simply for altruistic purposes, just as it would be naive to think anybody else does it simply for altruistic purposes,"" she said.Graeme Smith, senior fellow at the ANU's Department of Pacific Affairs, said Solomon Islands was ""at the centre of this panic about Chinese bases"" now but a few years ago, that space was held by Vanuatu.Vanuatu's former ambassador to China, Sela Molisa, recently told the ABC's Pacific Beat program the 83-island nation desperately needed several development projects, including airports, roads and wharves.It was a wharf that raised eyebrows back in 2018.The $114 million Chinese-funded project is deep enough for cruise ships but also naval vessels to dock.Reports swirled that Beijing was seeking to build a permanent military base in the Pacific and was eyeing Vanuatu.Vanuatu's Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu strenuously denied it at the time.""No-one in the Vanuatu government has ever talked about a Chinese military base in Vanuatu of any sort,"" he said.""We are a non-aligned country. We are not interested in militarisation, we are just not interested in any sort of military base in our country.""Vanuatu government spokesperson Fred Vurobaravu reiterated there was no plan for a Chinese military base in Santo – which was a US naval base during World War II — ""and that position will remain unchanged"".He said it was one of the largest wharves in the South Pacific and Vanuatu was fortunate to have it.Dr Newton Cain said talk of a Chinese military base in the region was speculation.""There isn't actually any evidence of that yet. We haven't seen a military base being established anywhere in the Pacific,"" she said.""That may happen. It may happen in the next five years. It may happen in the next 10 years. It may never happen.""She said Pacific leaders had made it clear that what threatened their security was not China, but climate change, and they did not want to be caught up in other nations' geopolitical competition.""[Pacific leaders have said], 'We don't want to be used as pawns on a chessboard. We're not a prize to be fought over.'""Another project causing some anxiety was a proposed Chinese-backed port in Vaiusu Bay, Samoa.Samoa's Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa scrapped the $128 million project shortly after winning the 2021 election, saying there were ""more pressing projects"".She said the level of Samoa's indebtedness to China had been a concern for voters.As of last year, China was the largest lender to Samoa, which owed Beijing about 40 per cent of its total debt, around $200 million.A Reuters analysis in 2018 found China's lending to the Pacific went from nearly zero to $US1.3 billion in a decade, and that Chinese loans accounted for around half of the external debt burden in Vanuatu and Tonga.Vanuatu's government spokesperson told the ABC he could not disclose the current debt owed to China, but said some past loans had been forgiven.Mr Dayant said that China had not engaged in deliberate debt trap diplomacy yet and while indebtedness was a risk for Pacific economies, the reality was more nuanced.At the same time, the sheer size of Chinese lending meant that it was an intense share of smaller countries' GDPs, and he said that if China wanted to avoid accusations of debt entrapment, it should change its approach to be more sustainable.Pacific nations have ""risen to the complexity that is Chinese lending"", he added.""Less and less Chinese loans are signed by PICs [Pacific Island countries], mostly because they have limited fiscal space available after a pandemic that is still having a big impact on the region,"" he said.But another key area of Chinese support to Samoa — and to the Pacific more broadly — is health.Beijing said it had dispatched 600 medical staff to Pacific nations, provided 600,000 doses of vaccines and more than 100 tonnes of medical supplies.For Samoa, that includes around half a million US dollars in COVID assistance for masks and other PPE.But medical assistance also pre-dates the pandemic, with medical training in China and almost $US1 million in medical equipment for a Samoan hospital, including an X-ray machine, ultrasound machines and ear, nose and throat diagnostic equipment.One of the most significant projects China has funded in the Pacific is the rebuilding of the CBD in Nuku'alofa, Tonga's capital, following pro-democracy riots in 2006.Beijing provided a loan of more than $US100 million for the rebuild.In 2020, Reuters reported that almost two-thirds of Tonga's external debt of $US186 million was owed to China, according to budget statements.But China has also highlighted its aid and relief efforts in the Pacific following cyclones and natural disasters.One of the most shocking incidents was the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano — the biggest explosion since Krakatoa in 1883.It triggered a tsunami that damaged large swathes of Tonga and left much of the country covered in volcanic ash, and also severed an underwater communications cable.""The Chinese government was highly concerned and acted immediately, making China the first country in the world to provide assistance to Tonga,"" China's Foreign Ministry said.Tonga said China had donated $US1.3 million in cash and relief and restoration assistance since the eruption, while the Australian government said it delivered a total of 370 tonnes of emergency supplies and pledged a $16 million package for Tonga's long-term recovery.As Mr Dayant from the Lowy Institute points out, Pacific Island countries' vulnerability to national disasters makes it one of the most aid-dependent regions in the world and its location in a highly-contested ocean makes it a focus of strategic thinking. When Frank Bainimarama seized control of Fiji in a military coup in 2006, Western sanctions and a diplomatic deep freeze swiftly followed.But China threw a lifeline to Fiji — its pledged aid skyrocketed and its diplomatic ties deepened.Australia re-engaged after elections were held in 2014. Mr Bainimarama won and has since transformed into a leading voice on the climate crisis facing the Pacific.""Geopolitical point-scoring means less than little to anyone whose community is slipping beneath the rising seas,"" he said in a press conference last week after it became clear a consensus had not been reached on the sweeping China-proposed agreement.While China — the most populous country — is the world's biggest polluter, some of its involvement in the Pacific has focused on climate change.Earlier this year, Beijing unveiled the China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Action Cooperation Centre.China also provided funds to Fiji in response to a series of cyclones, as well as $US1.4 million to build a sea wall to protect against rising ocean levels.""Now, they are well established in the Pacific. Chinese aid has done its job,"" Mr Dayant said.He said Chinese aid also provided a vehicle to implement state-owned enterprises in the region.Dr Newton Cain added that the state-owned enterprises had ""evolved and modified"" to become part of the business community in some countries.That included bidding for local contracts, workers living in the country and sending their children to school there, and supporting local football teams.""They are becoming part of the environment in which they work,"" she said.Some Fijians told the Associated Press they saw a benefit to Chinese foreign investment in the country, as long as it uplifted people.One of them, Georgina Matilda, said working for Chinese infrastructure company China Railway meant she could put food on the table for her children.Dr Newton Cain said there was a move away from donors flying in their own workers solely, as countries were increasingly concerned about whether infrastructure projects would lead to local jobs.""These big Chinese companies are recognising that is something that people are watching,"" she said.""In small economies, a couple of big road-building projects … you would expect there to be significant spillover effects, so that … it is actually injecting some cash into the local economy.""Niue's Premier and Foreign Minister Dalton Tagelagi met with Mr Wang via a video call last month, and the Chinese government said both sides pledged to ""deepen bilateral cooperation including on the Belt and Road Initiative"". It said the two countries had signed documents that would boost cooperation on infrastructure and broadcasting as well as ""expand the blue economy and the biopharmaceutical corporation"" — but what this looked like in reality was unclear.Niue is a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand and has had diplomatic relations with China since 2007 — its second-largest trade partner.Niue has a population of approximately 1,600 and a landmass of just 261 square kilometres but lays claim to an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Pacific Ocean that's about the size of Vietnam.While little is known about the ins and outs of agreements between Niue and China, Dr Smith said China's efforts were likely aimed at keeping Niue onside.""To some extent … it's just about Taiwan,"" he said.""Territorial integrity is still the main driver of their strategy in the region ... reducing Taiwan's diplomatic spaces there has always been right up there.""So you paid the minimum to keep them in your camp.""Cook Islands is reported to have a number of projects with China assisting the island nation in a range of areas including public services, education and the fishing industry.Among them are public works including the refurbishments of a Chinese-constructed Ministry of Justice building, a police headquarters and a sports arena, which Denghua Zhang, a research fellow at ANU's College of Asia and the Pacific, said were similar to China's projects around the region. All three were built with Chinese loans between 2004 and 2009, but fell into disrepair and were built with materials ""inappropriate for the Cook Islands tropical environment"", according to the Lowy Institute. China has agreed to fund the repairs.There's also the China-New Zealand-Cook Islands water supply project (Te Mato Vai) to upgrade the supply network on the main island of Rarotonga that launched in 2014.As Dr Zhang wrote in a 2015 paper, the project — led by a Chinese company and estimated to cost about $NZ60 million ($54 million)— was to be partly funded by a grant from New Zealand and a concessional loan from China.The ""triangular"" aid project also meant New Zealand could learn about China's aid delivery and ensure the concessional loan from China was well managed, the paper said.But after the completion of stage one in 2017, a leak was detected and an independent review found that 17 kilometres of pipeline needed replacing. Stage two of the project is being completed by construction company McConnell Dowell, a subsidiary of a company called Aveng which has its headquarters in South Africa. Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is one of two countries in the North Pacific to recognise China, with Palau, Nauru and Marshall Islands still diplomatically tied to Taiwan.It was David Panuelo, President of FSM, who wrote to other Pacific leaders warning that China's proposed deal was ""a smokescreen for a larger agenda"".""Despite our ceaseless and accurate howls that climate change represents the single most existential security threat to our islands, the Common Development Vision threatens to bring a new Cold War era at best, and a world war at worst,"" he wrote.FSM is in a compact of free association with the US. That gives the US control over airspace and waters in exchange for the US providing funding, defence and access to US social services for Micronesians.At the same time, FSM has been a beneficiary of Chinese money, with more than $US100 million funnelled into the country over 30 years.The Lowy Pacific Aid Map shows China has committed $US5 million per year from 2017 to 2025, as well as a $US2 million cash grant to the country's trust fund.Dr Zhang has noted that FSM has a policy of not taking loans, helping it to avoid debt risk.China has also funded roads, bridges and a state government complex in the country. ""What we do in the island country is to build roads and bridges, not to increase military presence,"" Mr Wang told his FSM counterpart last week.","Asia, China, Cook Islands, Defence and National Security, Disaster Relief, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, International Aid and Trade, Kiribati, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Niue, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2022-06-07T18:37:01+00:00

This is very troubling,"" Ryan Washburn, USAID's mission director to the Philippines, Pacific Islands and Mongolia, wrote in an email.""This is very unfortunate,"" said Erin Nicholson, acting deputy assistant administrator for the USAID Bureau for Asia.In response to the ABC's coverage of the signed pact, the deputy mission director for the Pacific Islands and Mongolia, Sean Callahan, said it was ""deja vu all over again"", in reference to when Solomon Islands switched its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 2019, ahead of a United Nations General Assembly.""The press and academia in Canberra and Wellington are making those same comparisons from 2019 too referring that again we got 'played' by the PM,"" he wrote.In the emails, officials questioned the timing of the deal and discussed the best way to respond to the news, which came just days out from a planned trip to Honiara by US officials, including the Indo-Pacific coordinator of the National Security Council, Kurt Campbell. The US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan had raised concerns about the controversial security pact between Beijing and Honiara, after a draft copy of the deal was leaked earlier this year.The West expressed concern the pact could lay the groundwork for a Chinese military base or presence in the region. Last week, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare sought to reassure Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong this would not be the case. ""I welcomed Prime Minister Sogavare's reassurances that there will not a military base or persistent foreign military presence here in Solomon Islands,"" Senator Wong said in Honiara.""And I welcomed his assurance that Australia remains Solomon Islands' first security partner of choice and development partner of choice.""Solomon Islands and the wider Pacific have played host to several foreign delegations since news of the security pact came to light. Senator Wong's visit last week — her third trip to Pacific nations since being sworn in last month — came soon after Solomon Islands received a large Chinese delegation led by Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Mr Wang's trip to the region in late May saw him visit eight Pacific nations over 10 days, signing up the island states to a range of bilateral deals.The ABC has reached out to Solomon Islands' government for comment.","China, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Pacific, Solomon Islands, United States, ",2022-06-22T05:27:26+00:00
104,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-05-30/china-foreign-minister-meeting-ten-pacific-island-ministers/101109278,"China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet with his Pacific Island counterparts today in Suva for a crucial virtual meeting that could have big ramifications for Australia and the whole region. Beijing has been pursuing a sweeping new agreement with a host of countries across the Pacific ahead of the meeting.Documents leaked to Reuters — and later obtained by the ABC — indicate China wants to reshape the existing regional order and expand cooperation across a vast range of areas including policing, cybersecurity, trade, fisheries and development. Today's meeting in Fiji's capital presents Wang Yi with an opportunity to seal the pact. But to do that he has to secure agreement from Pacific Island states. At this stage, that looks like a tall order. One Pacific Island leader has already criticised the proposal, while others seem very uneasy. There is absolutely no guarantee this gambit will succeed. But things might become a bit clearer after the meeting winds up on Monday afternoon.All the Pacific Island countries which recognise China will attend: Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Cook Islands, Niue and Federated States of Micronesia.That means all Pacific states except for Tuvalu, Palau, the Marshall Islands and Nauru, which all still maintain ties with Taiwan instead.This is only the second time that China's Foreign Minister has met his Pacific counterparts in a joint meeting. The first meeting was in October last year.This meeting will be held at Fiji's historic Grand Pacific Hotel, where Mr Wang has been staying.Given COVID-19 restrictions in some countries and the difficulty of travel around the Pacific, foreign ministers are expected to dial into the meeting virtually rather than flying to Fiji to attend. But the fact that China is now holding regular foreign-minister-level meetings with Pacific Island nations is another illustration of the way it is trying to deepen political and strategic links with the region. You can find a copy of the agreements being pursued at the bottom of the story here.The documents not only lay out a plan to expand policing cooperation but also propose a new free trade arrangement between China and the Pacific, a new Chinese government envoy to the region, intensified cyber security cooperation and deeper cooperation across a host of sectors from agriculture to fishery and pandemic management.While some of the promises are vague, and could easily come to nothing, the scope of the document — as well as Beijing's shift from dealing bilaterally with Pacific states to chasing a broad-brush pact with multiple countries — has unnerved some in the region.The President of Micronesia has already slammed the proposed agreement. In an extraordinary letter to fellow Pacific Island leaders, he warned China's proposal could spark a new Cold War between China and the West in the Pacific.He also declared that Pacific Island states risked being pulled into Beijing's orbit, suggesting they would lose sovereignty and independence.One Pacific government official told the ABC that some states in the region were not keen on discussing the pact during the meeting, but other countries in the group had pressed to include it.Tracking progress over the last few days has not been easy. There are contradictory accounts of whether the agreement remains a formal agenda item for this meeting or not.But it seems very likely that foreign ministers will have to discuss the deal given the blaze of publicity over the last week.And if Beijing can somehow keep it on the docket and secure an agreement from multiple states, it will count it as a huge diplomatic coup.Diplomats and analysts alike are predicting that China's push to land this deal will falter.Pacific Island states value consensus and do not tend to relish public confrontation in diplomatic fora. Where possible, they seek to reach agreements through quiet negotiation and deliberative discussions. The fact that this document has already been leaked and denounced shatters that possibility.Some Western officials say the proposed agreement looks awfully like an ambit claim and that China's chances of success are very slim.The day after the leak, one diplomat told the ABC that it would likely collapse. But just because something seems unlikely does not mean it is impossible. You can bet that several countries will be watching today's meeting very carefully.And even if China fails in its push to land an agreement with all Pacific countries, that does not mean that some individual nations will not press ahead and sign it.If there is one thing Wang Yi's trip to the Pacific has signalled, it is that Australia is not the only country pursuing a Pacific step up.","Asia, China, Defence Forces, Foreign Affairs, Pacific, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-05-29T19:37:58+00:00

The ABC also reported on Monday that Wang Yi was expected to visit at least five countries in the Pacific region.But the Foreign Ministry's announcement still provides the first complete picture of China's plans.Wang Wenbin said that the trip would ""further enhance the political mutual trust between China and the above countries"", ""push cooperation in various fields to a new level"" and ""inject new impetus into the long-term development of bilateral relations.""The Foreign Minister's progress will be closely watched by Australian officials who are anxious about China's move to cement commercial, strategic and security ties with Pacific Island nations, particularly in the wake of the security pact which Beijing signed with Solomon Islands last month.The Financial Times has reported that China may be eyeing similar agreements in other Pacific island nations, including in Kiribati.Kiribati's government has firmly denied that claim, although one Western government official told the ABC that was a ""plausible"" prospect.While Wang Yi will visit Kiribati he will only stay in the country for four hours, largely because of the Pacific Island country's strict COVID control quarantine measures.One Pacific Island government source told the ABC they believed there had been ""long and intense"" negotiations over this leg of his trip, and that Kiribati only agreed to the visit after China applied intense pressure.In a statement, Kiribati's government called the visit an ""important milestone for Kiribati-China relations"" that would ""strengthen and promote partnership and cooperation between our two countries after the resumption of diplomatic ties in 2019.""Meanwhile, Chinese state media outlets are already trumpeting the trip as evidence of China's growing influence throughout the Pacific.""Wang's trip to the South Pacific region comes after a series of recent US diplomatic activities in Asia, including a special summit with ASEAN leaders and US President's visits to South Korea and Japan, that intended to strengthen containment against China,"" said the Communist Party tabloid Global Times, quoting Chinese ""analysts.""""The US is trying to contain China with its Indo-Pacific Strategy, but now China's footprints are ubiquitous in the region outside the second island chain, and this proves the US' containment strategy is not working.""Washington and Canberra's attempt to form a regional alliance to target China is doomed to fail.""The Lowy Institute's Pacific analyst Jonathan Pryke said the ""marathon"" and ""historic"" trip by the Foreign Minister would be closely watched in Western capitals.""It will no doubt have a lot of analysts in the west nervous, both for what it signals of China's renewed engagement but also for what deals will be signed along the way,"" he said.""For the jet-setting foreign minister though it will just be another standard week in the job.""","China, Foreign Affairs, Pacific, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-05-24T14:06:39+00:00

It's fairly close to Hawaii,"" he said.""And it has a massive exclusive economic zone in terms of the territorial waters.""In Fiji, Wang Yi is likely to meet not just with Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama but also with senior officials at the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in the capital, Suva.One Pacific Islands government source said Wang Yi would also likely hold a virtual meeting with several other Pacific Islands foreign ministers while in the country.Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape confirmed yesterday the Chinese embassy in Port Moresby had advised his government of the Foreign Minister's visit to PNG next week.""The Foreign Minister is a high minister by ranking, in as far as the Chinese Government structure is concerned,"" he said.""And, so, if he confirms to fly in here, the Papua New Guinean Government will give him all the respect that he deserves, and all the protocols.""","Australia, China, Foreign Affairs, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-05-23T18:55:11+00:00

We will respond appropriately in time when I am back in Australia,"" he said.But he also reiterated that ""it's not Australia that has changed, China has changed"", and called for Beijing to lift trade sanctions. Despite the warmer signals, Chinese analysts are only hopeful for modest improvements after years of what Beijing described as Australia's ""anti-China crusade"".They say we can expect less ""bombastic talk"", a return of diplomacy, and more focus on regional relationships rather than just strengthening US ties. In the lead-up to the election, former prime minister Scott Morrison accused Labor of being soft on China.But Mr Albanese agreed with the Morrison government that China had changed since Labor was last in power in 2013 – the same year Xi Jinping became president.""It's more forward-leaning, it's more aggressive,"" Mr Albanese said in a leaders' debate earlier this month.""That means that Australia of course must respond.""Professor James Laurenceson from the UTS Australia-China Relations Institute said there was a possibility for an improved trajectory, but he doesn't expect a ""reset"".Labor shared concerns about China's more assertive foreign policy behaviour that ""sometimes skirts international rules and norms"", but there would likely be a shift away from provocation, he said.""Labor's approach for dealing with this challenge is different to the Morrison government's – less bombastic talk, more practical action, and more emphasis on non-hard power responses like diplomacy,"" Professor Laurenceson told the ABC.Pichamon Yeophantong, a senior lecturer at UNSW Canberra, agreed that there would be a change in rhetoric that would be ""less provocative, more restrained"".""However, I think there are still limitations regarding what extent a change in tone would help to address some of the more structural and fundamental issues that underlie tensions,"" Dr Yeophantong said. ""It's not just about the rhetoric, it is also about making those concrete policy steps to rebuild essentially trust within this bilateral relationship.""Conflict surrounding human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and provocations in the South China Sea are not going to go away, Professor Laurenceson said. But that doesn't mean the relationship can't improve. ""There's plenty of countries around the world that express publicly their concerns about those issues … despite doing that, they still managed to maintain relations with China in a far better state than Australia's relationship with China currently is,"" he said.Over the years, Australia has focused on strengthening relationships in the region that are firmly aligned with the United States and designed to compete with Beijing.The Morrison government restarted the Quad security partnership with the US, India and Japan, which has long drawn both headlines and the ire of the Chinese government.It then joined with the United Kingdom and the US to form the AUKUS agreement last year — a move widely seen as an attempt to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific.""Those two initiatives were both set up through the lens of US-China strategic competition,"" Professor Laurenceson said.""And by joining them, Australia made very clear its preference to maintain US primacy in the Asia-Pacific region.""I think that's what's going to change under a Labor government … Labor is also more willing to engage with regional partners on their own terms and listen to their advice.""Dr Yeophantong said it was clear that the new government was unlikely to change its position on issues like support for AUKUS and the Quad, but hoped it would focus on engaging more widely with the region.""So to look beyond the China issue, and to really focus on building up and rebuilding bilateral relationships and multilateral relationships with countries in this region,"" she said. ""I think that could help to signal a more promising shift – one that Beijing may also find less inflammatory or less concerning.""Penny Wong, who has been has been sworn in as Labor's Foreign Affairs Minister, has signalled her intentions to work more closely with South-East Asia and didn't waste any time reaching out to the Pacific.She posted a video statement on Twitter soon after being sworn in ""to share some thoughts with our Pacific family"".""We want to help build a stronger Pacific family, that is why we will do more. But we will also do it better,"" she said.Senator Wong has since announced that she plans to visit Fiji as early as Thursday.During the election campaign, Labor pledged to boost engagement with the region by creating a South-East Asia office within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and appointing a ""dedicated high-level roving regional ambassador"".Mr Albanese also promised to travel to Indonesia as his first diplomatic visit after attending the Quad meeting in Japan.""We live in a region whereby in the future, we will have China, India and Indonesia as giants,"" he said.""We need to strengthen that economic partnership. And one way that we can do that is by strengthening people-to-people relations as well.""Given China's ongoing aggression towards Taiwan and increasing influence in the Pacific, Australia's military and defence policies across the region appear unlikely to change.Both the Coalition and Labor were accused of looking the other way when China and the Solomon Islands signed a controversial security pact. Mr Albanese on Tuesday said that Solomon Islands was discussed at the Quad meetings, ""including the issue in which China is seeking to exert more influence in the Pacific"".He said the Quad had discussed the question ""how do we make sure we push our shared values in the region at a time when China is clearly seeking to exert more influence?""The comments came as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi began a Pacific trip of unprecedented scope and ambition.He plans to travel to eight countries across the region in 10 days.Dr Jian Zhang, from Canberra's Australia Defence Academy, said while Mr Albanese's election victory provided an opportunity to improve relations with China the move would need to be managed cautiously.""Improved relations are more likely to be managed diplomatically by trying to take moderate measures without involving Australia's key security interests, not directly challenging China, and not actively stirring,"" he told the ABC.It will be ""a precarious balancing act"" for the Albanese government, Dr Yeophantong said.Labor will need to remain strong on national security and proactive in reaching out to other countries in the region, while mending and building bridges with Beijing, she said. ""I feel like that is going to perhaps define the foreign policy of the Albanese government,"" Dr Yeophantong said. She said the Albanese government was sending strong signals that it would follow a similar foreign policy approach to what the Biden government was doing with China and the Indo-Pacific more broadly.“If we were to look at the Biden administration, we see restrained rhetoric, but also that stronger focus on broader engagement with countries in the Indo-Pacific,"" she said. ""Biden himself has been trying to engage a variety of countries on a flurry of visits in the region. But at the heart of it is about carving out a clear identity.""","Asia, Australia, China, Elections, Federal Government, Foreign Affairs, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Territorial Disputes, World Politics, ",2022-05-25T05:35:29+00:00

If AFP is striking deals with government MPs, then it surely compromises their work here,"" he said.The ABC has asked Mr Wale's office to provide documentation supporting the allegation but they declined.A statement from the Solomon Islands government on behalf of Mr Tran rejected Mr Wale's allegation as ""full of concocted lies"".The statement said the AFP had approached Mr Tran last year and leased the property for what it said was a market rate of $SBD26,000 ($4,528) per month.""The lease agreement was signed where a monthly Withholding Tax of 10 per cent of $SBD26,000 is paid monthly to the Solomon Islands Government,"" it said.The AFP confirmed to the ABC that it had leased a block of land in Honiara ""to support ongoing operational requirements"", although it did not provide further details.However, it denied any wrongdoing or paying an inflated price for the rental property.""Any suggestion the AFP has not acted with integrity in this matter is categorically false,"" an AFP spokesperson said in a statement.That statement did not say how much it paid for the land, saying it was ""limited in what further information it can provide, due to commercial-in-confidence issues"".The episode is another demonstration of how strained Australia's ties are with major players on both sides of the political divide in Solomon Islands right now.Mr Wale has been a fierce critic of Mr Sogavare's move to sign a security pact with China, which has stirred great anxiety in Australia.However, he has also accused the Australian government of ignoring warnings that he gave last year about the prospect of China and Solomon Islands strengthening security ties.That drew a strong reaction from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), which took the rare step of issuing a statement directly rejecting Mr Wale's account, and insisting the Opposition Leader had never directly raised the subject with the department.The China-Solomon Islands security pact is likely to hit the headlines again next week, with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi expected to visit Honiara on the first leg of his trip through the Pacific.","Australia, Corruption, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Pacific, Solomon Islands, ",2022-05-20T07:15:49+00:00

She was, admittedly, a ""huge baby"" who made for a challenging and traumatic delivery.""I had her at about 39 weeks, and she was 4.6 kilograms because, of course, that's what I needed, to have a humungous baby to deal with,"" she joked.Despite the arduous journey to become a mother, Ms Movono said Esther was ""just the prettiest thing, the easiest baby"".Not long after, Ms Movono fell pregnant again with Esther's brother, Jacob.""It was a pretty difficult journey,"" she said.""I know a lot of women who will not talk about these issues because they're of a reproductive health nature and it has a taboo element attached to it,"" she said.Dr Edith Kariko is a Senior Health Specialist with the World Bank in Port Moresby. She said infertility stigma also affected women in Papua New Guinea because sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were a leading cause of fertility issues, and few women want to discuss it. ""If you're a woman of reproductive age, you can't speak up about vaginal discharge or pains in the lower abdomen, pain with urination,"" she said.""They wait until the last minute and that results in untreated STIs that have already caused complications [to a woman's fertility].""Dr Kariko said sexual and reproductive health education in schools was inadequate and needed to be revised to create a ""culturally enabling environment"" for such conversations to take place.""Having the awareness on where they can get help, or what is causing particular infertility, even for young people to discuss this openly before they get into relationships is really critical,"" she said. Dr Leeanne Panisi is the only female fertility specialist among a cohort of four in Solomon Islands and works at Honiara's National Referral Hospital. She said cultural practices such as 'bride price' were being abused in some cases to add pressure on women to conceive. ""There are certain communities where women are expected to get pregnant and have children because ... 'bride price' was paid and the families of the husband or the partner expect her to have children,"" she said.For the women who had exhausted all fertility options, Dr Panisi said, adoption within families was the next best thing. ""Usually the adoption is from a close relative or family member, but it can be also from somebody from a different culture or a distant relative,"" she said.Lealaiauloto Lia'i Si'itia is the director of the Samoa Family Health Association.In Samoa today, Lealaiauloto said women who could not afford to see specialists often sought help from traditional practitioners, despite their procedures being known to ""aggravate"" fertility issues.""They come very late to family fertility centres because they first seek help from traditional practitioners, caregivers, nurses and sometimes churches,"" she said.""[The view] is that [women] are not blessed with a child so they need to seek some spiritual blessings, advice and traditional healing.""","Family and Relationships, Fiji, Health, Healthcare Clinic, Healthcare Facilities, Indigenous (Other Peoples), Medical Procedures, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Parenting, Poverty, Relationships, Religion and Beliefs, Sexual Health, Solomon Islands, Welfare, Women, ",2022-05-22T18:46:10+00:00

in Australia and the United States is not the first security agreement Beijing has inked with a Pacific nation. But experts say the deal signed by Beijing and Honiara last month is ""qualitatively different"" and the geopolitical context has changed.Beijing and Fiji signed a memorandum of understanding centred around police cooperation in 2011, and another agreement in 2014 on defence issues such as border control, equipment and training.Wesley Morgan, a research fellow from the Griffith Asia Institute, said those agreements were focused on combating transnational crime like cybercrime and drug trafficking.""We saw secondments, where Fiji police went to China, there was training, there's been some provision of equipment,"" Dr Morgan said.But he said there had also been discussions about closer defence cooperation including training for Fiji defence officials in China and providing arms, particularly for peacekeeping operations.Beijing offered to help build a Fijian naval facility in 2015, donated a hydrographic surveillance vessel to the Fijian navy in 2018 and 47 military vehicles in 2020.During the past decade, Beijing has also supplied police and military resources to Vanuatu, Samoa, Cook Islands and Papua New Guinea.Dr Morgan said that even before Australia was a federated nation, the colonies were worried about a foreign power establishing a big presence in the Pacific islands.""In the 1880s and the 1890s Australian politicians were concerned about Germany, they were concerned about France, and they called on Britain to annex parts of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands,"" he said.""Obviously, that's an awful long time ago, but the point is that this is deep.""This is kind of an Australian strategic instinct … that foreign powers should not have a presence in the Pacific islands.""Dr Morgan said past partnerships between China and Pacific nations had prompted concerns in Australia, but nothing like the ""sky high"" response to the recent Solomon Islands deal.He said a key reason for that was the changing geopolitics of the region.""China has become more authoritarian under [President] Xi Jinping,"" he said. ""China has become more assertive, including things like military installations in the South China Sea.""Dr Morgan said when Mr Xi visited Canberra in 2014 at the invitation of then prime minister Tony Abbott the relations between Australia and China were quite warm.""The rhetoric from Australian officials was about the Pacific Ocean being big enough for all of us,"" he said.""Now, they're in the deep freeze, really.""Dr Morgan pointed out Fiji signed its agreements with China while its relationship with Australia was in a rough patch.Australia had distanced itself from Fiji following a military coup in 2006, to encourage the Pacific nation to return to democratic elections, he said.During that period, Fiji looked to China for security assistance, he said.He added that Australia quickly sought to normalise relations after Fiji held a democratic election in 2014, and has maintained strong engagement with the Pacific nation since.""In recent times, we've seen Australia actually building a military facility in Fiji, the Blackrock camp, and recently announced support for a new naval facility in Fiji,"" he said.Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has denied that Australia's big fear would come to fruition and China would be allowed to build a military base in the nation.However, the text of the pact signed by Beijing and Honiara has not been made public and a leaked draft indicated Chinese security forces could be deployed to Solomon Islands to protect Chinese interests there.James Batley, a former Australian high commissioner to Solomon Islands, said that was one of the major concerns for Australia.""I think that's a very open-ended commitment that Solomon Islands has signed up to and I think that's what makes it qualitatively different from the much lower-level cooperation that's taken place in the past,"" Mr Batley said.The deal has also become a major topic of debate in the Australian federal election campaign.""Clearly, the opposition has sought to exploit this agreement,"" Mr Batley said.But Mr Batley said the level of concern expressed by Australia, New Zealand and the United States towards the security pact was warranted.""I think [the deal] does suggest quite serious intent on the part of the Chinese government,"" he said.""China has been intensifying its objectives of both deepening security cooperation with Pacific Island countries, but also, I think, actively undermining the interests of countries like Australia and the US.""Mr Batley added it was possible that China would seek, or even already had, similar security deals with other Pacific island nations.Commentators within Australia and the Pacific have said the Solomon Islands deal is a sign that Australia has neglected its relationship with the region.Sinclair Dinnen, from the Australian National University, said when it came to policing, Australia's cooperation with the region outstripped China's.""Australia, as traditional partners, have been engaged with Pacific island police forces over many, many years,"" Dr Dinnen said.""There hasn't been much indication that the Pacific island countries themselves have been looking for additional support.""Australia was a leading member of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, aimed at helping restore stability in Solomon Islands from 2003 to 2017, and had continued to provide training to the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force.""I don't think you can say that Australia has not been sufficiently engaged in the security sector.""But Dr Dinnen said development partners could help address other social issues in Solomon Islands, which had a young and rapidly growing population with relatively few economic opportunities.""That really requires a much broader human security focus,"" he said.","Australia, China, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, United States, World Politics, ",2022-05-05T18:44:13+00:00

in an election where national security already loomed large.During an interview with ABC Radio on April 21, 2022, Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong said the government had damaged Australia's relationship with Solomon Islands and undermined regional security through numerous missteps, among them making cuts to foreign aid.""The government should not have dropped the annual bilateral development assistance to the Solomons, which is 28 per cent on average per year lower under them than under us,"" Senator Wong said.So, has Australia's annual aid to Solomon Islands been, on average, 28 per cent lower under the Coalition than under Labor?RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates.Senator Wong's claim is not the full story.Australian foreign aid to Solomon Islands was on average almost 35 per cent lower per year under the Coalition compared with the previous Labor government, in inflation-adjusted terms.However, a major cause of that has been the end of Australia's role in a 14-year mission to Solomon Islands, which began in 2003 with the aim of restoring law and order after the country began sliding into civil unrest.This led to a surge in funding that experts told Fact Check was similar to assistance offered following a natural disaster, and which they said rendered the comparison largely meaningless.Funding for the regional assistance mission decreased under both Labor and Coalition governments before ending entirely in mid-2017.One expert noted that despite the mission ending, none of the substantial development programs operating alongside it had been cut.Part of a nation's ""soft power"" toolkit, foreign aid comes in various forms and can serve various purposes, such as the enhancement of national security or the achievement of humanitarian or diplomatic goals.In Australia's case, the government defines aid as spending that meets the definition of ""official development assistance"" (ODA), set by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.The OECD defines this as ""government aid that promotes and specifically targets the economic development and welfare of developing countries"".Fact Check has used 2007-08 as Labor's first financial year in office, on the basis that it was in power for more than half of that year.Similarly, Fact Check has attributed the 2013-14 year to the Coalition, which was elected in September 2013.The incoming government soon delivered on its promise to review the existing aid budget, announcing in January 2014 that total aid expenditure would be $107 million less than in 2012-13. The new annual aid figure for 2013-14 of $5.042 billion was also $624 million lower than Labor had allocated in its final budget.Country-level data on Australia's foreign aid is collated by the Department of Foreign Affairs, which publishes a standard time series from 1974-75.These nominal figures reflect ""current prices"", meaning they do not take inflation into account.Consistent with previous analysis, Fact Check has relied on the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Consumer Price Index (CPI) to calculate inflation-adjusted figures.This methodology mirrors that used by Australian National University's Development Policy Centre to produce its Australian Aid Tracker data.Averages for each government have been calculated using actual expenditure figures, available to 2020-21.Estimates for 2021-22 and 2022-23, found in the department's portfolio budget summaries, have not been used to assess Senator Wong's claim but are included for completeness, with projected CPI figures drawn from the federal budget.Where possible, Fact Check has included temporary aid provided by the Australian government to combat COVID-19.A spokeswoman for Senator Wong told Fact Check her claim was based on data from the department's yearly statistical summaries, which differ slightly from the standard series preferred by Fact Check.Senator Wong has also included estimated spending to June 2023 but excluded temporary COVID-19 aid.Senator Wong said annual aid was on average 28 per cent lower under the Coalition than under Labor.The data shows that, in nominal terms, aid to Solomon Islands averaged at $171.7 million per year under the Coalition, compared with $228.5 million under Labor.That means the annual aid budget was on average 24.9 per cent ($56.8 million) smaller under the Coalition.As the chart shows, there was a spike in aid spending from 2018-19.This came after the Coalition agreed to help build an undersea telecommunications cable linking Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, replacing a contract signed with Chinese telecommunications company Huawei.For this, the government budgeted $53 million in additional aid to Solomon Islands in 2018-19, and another $30 million in 2019-20.The standard series shows the nation also received $15.9 million in temporary pandemic aid in 2020-21, or roughly five per cent of the $303.7 million given to Pacific nations plus Timor-Leste.The Coalition plans to give a further $174.8 million in COVID-19 aid to the region in 2021-22, and another $332.4 million in 2022-23.The gap between Labor and the Coalition widens further once the figures are adjusted for inflation.In 2011-12 dollars, Australia's aid to Solomon Islands averaged at $235.7 million per year under Labor then fell to $154.4 million per year under the Coalition.In other words, the annual aid budget was, on average, 34.7 per cent ($81.8 million) smaller under the Coalition.Notably, the data also shows that the decline in expenditure began under the previous Labor government, which, in nominal or real terms, spent less in its last year than its first.Although the numbers show that aid to Solomon Islands fell under the Coalition, its term coincided with the winding up of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), a multinational peacekeeping and capacity building operation that aimed to re-establish law and order during a period of growing civil unrest.Led and largely funded by Australia, the mission began in July 2003 and lasted the 14 years to June 2017.Director of ANU's Development Policy Centre Stephen Howes told Fact Check the intervention ""was a response to a type of disaster"" — namely, a breakdown in government — that ""resulted in a tripling of the aid budget to Solomons"".For that reason, Professor Howes said, comparing what happened during and after the mission was ""not informative"" because it was similar to comparing aid ""immediately after a natural disaster and, say, ten years after that disaster"".""The decline in aid as RAMSI came to an end actually started under Labor,"" he added.Indeed, data provided to the Senate (question 215) in November 2013 by the department of foreign affairs shows that Australia's overall contribution to RAMSI decreased under both parties, with a particularly large fall recorded in 2012-13.The University of Tasmania's Richard Herr, who has previously led the University of Fiji's Centre for International and Regional Affairs, similarly described the mission as ""essentially like delivering humanitarian assistance after a natural disaster"".In an email to Fact Check, Dr Herr said that it would be difficult to quantify exactly how much of the aid budget went to RAMSI, which comprised multilateral and bilateral aid along with a peacekeeping component.However, ""RAMSI was such a large infusion of special purpose aid that it seriously skewed the figures,"" he said.Analysis by the independent think tank the Lowy Institute shows that RAMSI boosted Solomon Islands' share of Australian aid to Oceania from 3 per cent to 24 per cent.University of Queensland political economist Shahar Hameiri told Fact Check he believed that RAMSI would account for ""the main difference"" between the Labor and Coalition budgets, and said the intervention was precisely why ""at its peak … Solomon Islands was the world's second most aid-dependent country"".Professor Hameiri added that ""the correlation between the money spent and the extent of Solomons' gratitude is shaky"", since ""almost all of the money associated with RAMSI went back to Australia"" through the use of consultants and the Australian Federal Police, for example.""It was a classic case of boomerang aid,"" he said.Alexandre Dayant, director of the Lowy Institute's Development Economics in Asia and the Pacific project, told Fact Check that while Senator Wong was ""technically right"" on the numbers, it was important to note that much of the aid between 2009 and 2011 in particular was tied up in RAMSI, and that ""a lot of the aid was also boomerang in nature"".Mr Dayant explained that as the mission wound down, so too did the funding attached to it.However, he said: ""None of the substantial development and governance programs operating alongside RAMSI were cut, and in fact have grown as more funding has been freed up from the drawing down of RAMSI.""Principal researcher: David Campbellfactcheck@rmit.edu.auDFAT, Supplementary budget estimates 2013-14, response to question on notice (Question no. 215)","ALP, Australia, Foreign Affairs,

It was different to other great powers who looked out onto a world of ocean. Zhu said China's future lay to the west. That was where the country could develop a trade and tourism empire. The story was relayed by Shah Javed Barki, when the Pakistani-American economist was vice president of the World Bank. He was in the room when Zhu set out his vision.Australia is drawing red lines and talking of war after China's security pact with Solomon Islands but, if we are concerned about China's growing power, we are looking in the wrong place.Yes, Pacific Island nations like Solomons are important but, to China, looking west is critical. Beijing has developed a powerful China-Pakistan economic corridor. It has built a port at Gwadar that opens up the Middle East and connects it all the way to Xinjiang in China's west.China is extending its economic clout across Central Asia into the Middle East and Africa. The massive Belt and Road investment and infrastructure project promises to be a 21st-century silk road.Of the 146 countries which have signed up to Belt and Road, overwhelmingly the greatest number are to the west of China.This is Xi Jinping's big play for greatness. China's Westward Expansion strategy seeks to secure the supply of energy resources from the Middle East. To China, Westward Expansion seeks to gain a vital edge over the US. China's Shanghai Cooperation Organisation includes all the Central Asian states. As Diplomat Magazine has pointed out, ""from Central Asia to the Middle East, no country falls within the sphere of direct US influence or poses a potential threat to China"".Yes, Belt and Road reaches into the Pacific; Fiji, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand are among those who have signed up.But the west is China's main game — what Brookings Institution fellow Rush Doshi has called ""the long game"".This is rooted in history and China's great shame after the fall of the Qing Empire in the 19th century. Doshi quotes the great Qing general, Li Hongzhang, who saw the future West overpowering a weak China and set his nation on a course of renewal.China failed to modernise and lost war to Japan. Li was one of the authors of what has become known as the ""hundred years of humiliation"".Xi Jinping seeks to avenge China's weakness. Already he is reshaping the world. At best China's growing economy enriches the world and it strengthens a global rules-based order.At worst China's aggressive authoritarian capitalism tips the world into conflict. Right now, we are seeing more of the worst.China's economic power is bringing nations from Central Asia to the Middle East and Africa under its sway. Its rise has tilted the balance of global power. It is a super power rival to the United States. And Xi believes the West is waning and the East is rising.It is already triggering a violent realignment. It is reasonable to say that the war in Ukraine would not be happening if not for China's rise and China's increasing alliance with Russia.Xi and Vladimir Putin are close; they signed a ""no limits"" pact during the Winter Olympics. Putin invaded the day after the Olympics closing ceremony.Now Solomon Islands has signed a security agreement with China, sealing the island nation's drift closer to Beijing. This has been happening since 2019, when it switched its diplomatic recognition away from Taiwan and towards mainland China.In the midst of our federal election campaign the Solomons-China deal is ringing alarm bells. The Coalition and Labor are trying to prove they can be tougher on the China threat.But both have been guilty of being inconsistent and ill-prepared, of looking the other way as China built its power and became ever more hard line.While the Chinese Communist Party was locking up Uyghurs and Tibetans, crushing dissent and winding back political freedoms, Australian governments were seduced by China's riches and wanting to believe that the Communist Party would become just like us.Tony Abbott as prime minister invited Xi Jinping to address a joint sitting of federal parliament and saw in him a partner for democracy.Before Abbott, Julia Gillard thought so little of China and Xi as a threat that she wound back Australia's security posture and cut defence spending. That was after her predecessor — the man she deposed — Kevin Rudd had flagged China's growing influence and sought to boost our military capacity.Labor was inconsistent and weak. The Coalition was naive or blind. Now Australia is trying to make up lost ground. Yet the warning signs were always there. More than a decade ago historian Azar Gat warned that ""authoritarian capitalist"" states like China and Russia ""may represent a viable alternative path to modernity"". Nothing was inevitable about the ultimate victory of liberal democracy.Looking to the lessons of history, Gat said previous challengers to the global order — Nazi Germany and imperial Japan — failed because they were too small. United States power consistently surpassed others. Without a strong US, he said, ""liberal democracy may well have lost the great struggles of the 20th century"".Is that still the case? Is the US able to meet the challenge? Gat said: ""China and Russia represent a return of economically successful authoritarian capitalist powers, which have been absent since the defeat of Germany and Japan in 1945, but they are much larger than the latter two countries ever were.""Gat's warning about the looming threat of authoritarian states disputed conventional wisdom in 2007, when his article first appeared in the journal Foreign Affairs. China was not on a pathway to liberal reform; it was, as the architect of China's opening up to the world, Deng Xiaoping, said, hiding its capacities and biding its time.Defence Minister Peter Dutton may well be right in warning Australians to prepare for war. Xi Jinping certainly is preparing China for war. Indeed, he is threatening conflict against Taiwan.But we aren't prepared, despite being warned for decades this was coming. We don't have the weaponry. Nuclear powered subs are decades away, if we ever get them.We need to build high-tech know-how. We can't even guarantee our fuel supply chains in the event of war.Yes, we are strengthening alliances: the Quad — Australia, US, Japan and India — and AUKUS with the UK and US. But sovereign defence capacity is a project of nation building. We aren't having that hard conversation during the election campaign. It is easier to talk of ""red lines"" and fears of war. They're the tough words, but how do we back them up?The 21st century was always going to be defined by the US-China rivalry. America may still be strong enough to rescue democracy.Xi Jinping, like his friend Vladimir Putin in Ukraine, may fatally overestimate his own strength.In any case, this is a time of reckoning. Solomon Islands has been a wake-up call for Australia. China is in the Pacific: significant and an important plank in Beijing's growing influence, but it is not the focus of Chinese expansionism.Thirty years ago Zhu Rongji looked at a map and pointed west. China's challenge today stretches to all points of the globe.Stan Grant is the ABC's international affairs analyst and presents China Tonight on Monday at 9:35pm on ABC TV, and Tuesday at 8pm on the ABC News Channel.","Australia, China, Federal Elections, Foreign Affairs, National Security, Solomon Islands, Unrest, Conflict and War, World Politics, ",2022-04-30T19:00:00+00:00

And it has since criticised the lack of transparency around the negotiations.Neither China nor Solomon Islands have yet agreed to make the final text they signed public.But in a lengthy and often furious address to parliament, Mr Sogavare suggested Australia was being hypocritical because it kept its negotiations with the United States and the United Kingdom over the AUKUS pact top secret.""I learnt of the AUKUS treaty in the media, Mr Speaker,"" he said in parliament.""One would expect that as a member of the Pacific family, Solomon Islands and members of the Pacific should have been consulted to ensure this AUKUS treaty is transparent since it will affect the Pacific family by allowing nuclear submarines in Pacific waters.""He also mocked the language adopted by Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Marise Payne, who have repeatedly stressed that Australia respects the sovereignty of Solomon Islands despite its concerns about the pact.""Oh, but Mr Speaker, I realise that Australia is a sovereign country which can enter into any treaty it wants to, transparently or not,"" Mr Sogavare said.""Which is exactly what they did with AUKUS.""The Prime Minister also delivered his strongest criticism yet of the security agreement his country has with Australia, while resuscitating deeply controversial claims that Australian personnel refused to protect Chinese-built infrastructure when restoring order in Honiara last year.Australia quickly sent troops and police to the capital last year – at Mr Sogavare's request — when it was rocked by riots in the wake of political protests directed at the Prime Minister.The ABC was in Honiara at the time.The violence and rioting began to subside when it was announced that Australia was sending troops to Honiara, and the city was largely calm by the time the personnel arrived.But Mr Sogavare repeated his allegation that Australian personnel refused to protect Chinese infrastructure and investments in Honiara when they were in the city, saying it showed ""gaps"" in the current arrangements with Australia.Australian government sources have repeatedly denied that allegation and the ABC has seen no evidence substantiating it.But Mr Sogavare said that denial from the Australian government was ""disappointing"".""What is needed, Mr Speaker, is an acknowledgement of a serious blunder,"" he declared.Mr Morrison responded by defending Australia's response to the riots and saying there were ""other influences"" on Mr Sogavare's perspective towards AUKUS.When asked if Mr Sogavare was ""parroting"" Chinese rhetoric, he said there was ""a remarkable similarity between those statements and those of the Chinese government"".Earlier, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng accused Australia of infringing on Solomon Islands' sovereignty.Speaking via video link on Thursday at the launch of the China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Action Cooperation Centre, Mr Xie said the security agreement was open and transparent and did not target any third party.""With what right can these countries tell China and Solomon Islands what to do?"" he said, according to state press agency Xinhua.""With what right can Australia draw a red line for Solomon Islands and China that are thousands of miles away from it?""Isn't this an infringement of other countries' sovereignty, interference in other countries' internal affairs and violation of international rules?"" ""The Pacific is home to all countries of the region, not a backyard or territory of anyone; it should be a stage of international cooperation, not an arena for geopolitical games,"" he added.According to China's foreign ministry, representatives from a number of Pacific nations including Kiribati, Niue, Samoa, Tonga, the Federated States of Micronesia, Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Fiji, Vanuatu and the Cook Islands attended the climate action centre's launch.","Australia, China, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, National Security, Pacific, Solomon Islands, United States, World Politics, ",2022-04-29T04:55:07+00:00

Our own churches? 500,000. Half a million,"" he said.""This is more serious practising Christians in China than the entire population of the Pacific Island nations including Australia and New Zealand put together. Yes, there are rules. There are restrictions.""""But Christianity is thriving because they obey the authorities.""Mr Sogavare also seemed to latch onto a piece written by an Australian analyst which suggested that the federal government might need to launch an invasion of Solomon Islands if China moved to set up a military base in the country.No government figure in Australia has publicly raised the prospect of invasion.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has described a Chinese military base as a ""red line"" for Australia and the United States. However, he declined to lay out exactly what he meant by that when pressed by journalists.Mr Sogavare seemed to suggest that option was being contemplated in Australia, saying Solomon Islands had received a ""touching warning of military intervention"".""In other words, we are threatened with invasion. Now that's serious,"" he said.A spokesperson for the Foreign Minister Marise Payne responded to Mr Sogavare's attack by saying Australia was ""deeply committed"" to the Pacific.""We respond in times of need, whether that is to natural disasters, economic and health shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic, or to civil unrest of the kind that took place in Solomon Islands late last year,"" they said.""We support our Pacific family and always will.""","Asia, Australia, China, Defence and National Security, Foreign Affairs, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Treaties and Alliances, World Politics, ",2022-05-04T07:48:43+00:00

He's unpredictable. But he's also a deft political operator. And I'd say he'd think he's in the driver's seat with this pact, he'd think he's still the boss. ""He's in the middle of two big powers — and really, he's trying to take advantage of that situation.""Mannaseh Sogavare is a political journeyman.The 67-year-old Seventh-Day Adventist from the Choiseul region in the far north-west of Solomon Islands is in his fourth stint as Prime Minister over a more than two-decade political career.  And throughout those stints he's had a complicated relationship with Australia, and Australia's presence in the country.         For former Solomon Islands high commissioner James Batley, one event sums up Mr Sogavare's malleability — and unpredictability — as a politician. Mr Batley was the leader of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) from 2004 to 2006  — a 14-year peacekeeping mission led by Australia to quell ethnic violence, known as ""The Tensions"". After helping to bring relative peace, RAMSI officially left the country in 2017.Mr Batley, who has known Mr Sogavare for more than two decades, said he witnessed ""emotional"" outbursts from the Prime Minister — then in his second stint — who aggressively opposed the RAMSI intervention.""Then we all went back to Honiara [Solomon Islands capital] for the end of RAMSI events and he was literally in tears, saying RAMSI was a 'blessing from god', and said 'thank you Australia and RAMSI for saving the country',"" he said.""Then I saw him in tears again at another forum meeting, and again another meeting I saw — it was quite a performance.""   For Mr Batley, now a distinguished policy fellow at the Australian National University's school of Asia Pacific affairs, last week's signing of the security pact with China came as no surprise.  ""But what was surprising was that this was so obviously an agreement drafted in Beijing and sent to Honiara,"" he said. ""From the China point of view, they've been angling for something like this in the region for years.""And for the Solomon Islands point of view, I also wasn't surprised as it plays into this idea that 'we're friends to all and enemies to none', we're able to leverage this geo-strategic competition to our advantage. ""And in many ways, Sogavare is uniquely susceptible to that line of thinking — that you should balance your relationships and don't depend on one power.""But I think he's absolutely underestimated the domestic consequences of this decision. It has badly damaged trust with Australia.""    The latest controversy is nothing new for Solomon Islands' Prime Minister.In fact, those that know and study him say he thrives in conflict. And the current situation in Solomon Islands can be traced back to a controversial event — his re-election in 2019 for his fourth stint as PM.  The gradual shift towards last week's pact started in late 2019, when, after months of speculation, Mr Sogavare announced the country would switch its political allegiances from Taiwan to China.  ""The Switch"" as it is known in Honiara, was announced amid revelations of ""dollar diplomacy"", and accusations of self-interest surrounding Mr Sogavare and his allies.Violence kicked off again in November last year, with rioters calling for Mr Sogavare to stand down.The rioters torched Honiara's Chinatown, triggering Australia to once-again deploy a peacekeeping force.Mr Sogavare later stared down the dissenters, surviving a no-confidence motion.Honiara-born Solomon Islands politics academic Joseph Foukona, from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, has been following Mr Sogavare's career since its beginning.   He said he rose to power — and maintains power — in a broader atmosphere of ""conflict and tension"" and the latest move with China was no different. ""And I'd say a lot of his moves [at the moment] are designed to keep himself in power,"" he said.""But I'd say also this decision to sign the pact with China is fundamentally driven by domestic issues.""According to Dr Foukona, it is hard to gauge the general reaction to the pact and whether it will impact Mr Sogavare domestically. He said some Solomon Islanders were taking a wait and see approach to the pact and China's presence.    However, he said there was nervousness, with concerns about the ""Chinese police culture"" coming into the country and Beijing's obvious disdain for democracy. Local media say the Prime Minister has recently beefed up security around parliament as well and his personal security, and rarely — if ever — conducts media conferences.  Griffith University Pacific Hub project lead Tess Newton Cain said the ""Chinese way"" suited the way Mr Sogavare did things.She said this was shown when he shut down Facebook in 2021, increased the power of the executive and made moves to back the ""gradual chipping away"" of the democratic process in Solomon Islands, such as his move to delay its upcoming election. ""He's a natural autocrat,"" she said. ""There are many facets in the way China operates that appeal to Pacific politicians, I hear this a lot. ""They say 'we never get anything done'. In China, they get things done."" Solomon Islands is set for a general election late next year.However, Sogavare's government has been pushing to delay the elections until after the Pacific Games, which it is scheduled to host in November 2023. The election is critical in an Australian context, as the Solomon Islands opposition party has vowed to tear up the security pact with China if it were to gain power.    Veteran Honiara-based freelance journalist Dorothy Wickham agreed with Dr Foukona that it was hard to read the reaction in Solomon Islands, particularly with about 80 per cent of the population living outside the capital. However, she said there was no doubt it would continue to be debated in the country — even if some had already lost interest.    ""The focus of some people are like 'big deal, we sign treaties all the time',"" she said. ""Others say, 'well if China can give us something better, well, let's go with China — we're a sovereign country, we can do what we like'. ""And then there's people saying we should be careful, we've seen what China has done around the world, and Solomon Islands will be no different. And others are dead against it.""But people are yet to see anything really negative out of China's aid so far.""They built the stadium here, they can see things being built fast, they've just announced they're going to work on the hospital — everyone here wants a hospital.""And as for his future as Prime Minister? According to Ms Wickham that one's ""hard to tell"". ""There's a lot of people out there who really don't like him,"" she said.    ""But he's got a small group of politicians around him who are protecting him. ""But ones thing's for certain: Solomon Islanders are at the point now when they're not shocked at anything he does!""","Australia, China, Federal Election, Federal Elections, Federal Parliament, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Politics and Government, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-04-29T20:20:37+00:00

There was mention of looking at aeroplanes.""That stands in stark contrast to the sweeping vision laid out in the MOU, which declares: ""Solomon [Islands] wishes to be part of the regional airline concept where Honiara would receive direct flights from China and become a regional hub."" ""For this vision, Solomon [Islands] needs to acquire new planes, such as MA600/MA700 and Y-12 aircraft and refurbish airfields,"" it says.The MA600 is a relatively new turboprop plane which AVIC Commercial Aircraft has already sold to a number of countries, including Laos and Benin.The MOU says the sale would ""depend on the further negotiations on price and concessional terms"" and would require ""ultimate approval of the board of Solomon Islands and the government of Solomon Islands"".The MOU also lays out an ambition to upgrade almost three dozen airstrips across Solomon Islands, saying the purchase of planes is ""in combination and is linked to facilitating the upgrade of Solomon Islands domestic airfields in 2 phases. For Phase 1, up to 15 airfields; for Phase 2, the remaining 20 airfields"".But again, there is no evidence that any of this work has begun.The MOU was one of six agreements signed by Solomon Islands and China in the aftermath of Honiara's decision to abandon its relationship with Taiwan and establish diplomatic ties with Beijing.Earlier this month, China and Solomon Islands announced they had signed a security pact, stoking fears in Australia that Beijing might be intent on establishing a military presence in the Pacific Island nation.Graeme Smith from the Australian National University told the ABC there was a ""great deal of urgency in the [aviation] agreement … far more urgency than you find in many MOUs between China and the Pacific"".He said the plan likely stalled because of the pandemic, which smashed the global airline industry and shut down most air travel into both countries.""I suspect mainly what stopped it from happening is COVID-19, because it was signed in November 2019 [just before the pandemic] and all the time lines … would have gone quickly out of the window,"" he said.""The requirements for this agreement to kick in would have required both a visit to China by the Solomon Islands side and a visit to Solomon Islands from the Chinese side, both of which would have been very difficult to manage after February 2020.""Dr Smith said AVIC may have sensed a commercial opportunity to sell planes to Solomon Islands on favourable terms which were effectively subsidised by Chinese state financial institutions.But he said there was also a clear ""strategic push"" animating the MOU.""In the first instance, this is a state-owned enterprise responding to a signal from its government to do things that are strategically in line with China's goals,"" he said.Dr Smith believed it was also worth noting that AVIC's commercial arm was deeply intertwined with the Chinese military, which might have an interest in scoping out airfields and other facilities in Solomon Islands.""Defence planners (in Australia) might be somewhat concerned at the involvement of this company. I think their concerns might be how readily information could be conveyed back to the Chinese military through this commercial enterprise,"" he said.""But we're getting into the realm of speculation. Is this company going to build a base in Solomon Islands? Probably not, it's not really what they do. But certainly, they have extremely strong ties to the Chinese military.""Several countries are already working on airport infrastructure in Solomon Islands.Australia and New Zealand have agreed to upgrade runways on Taro Island near Choiseul Bay and Seghe Airport on the New Georgia Islands, while New Zealand has previously funded airport upgrades at the towns of Munda and Gizo.Japan and the World Bank are also currently funding an upgrade of the runway of Honiara International Airport.The ABC has tried repeatedly to contact both Mr Agovaka and AVIC Commercial Aircraft for comment, but neither have yet responded.","Asia, China, Defence and National Security, Foreign Affairs, National Security, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-04-28T18:18:44+00:00

We wouldn't have cut bilateral aid by 28 per cent on average every year,"" Senator Wong said.""We wouldn't have mocked Pacific Island nations about water lapping at their doors which is what Peter Dutton did standing next to Scott Morrison.""And we wouldn't have thumbed our nose at Pacific leaders when they told us at a forum that climate change was their number one national security issue. ""So yes, I do think there's a different approach. Do I think it's easy? No, I do not which is why it shouldn't be the subject of shrill scare campaigns."" On Saturday, Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers flagged that he believed cuts to foreign aid by the government were partly to blame for the controversial deal going ahead, ""by being a credible partner on climate change, having a credible climate change policy"".In the past decade, spending on foreign aid has been slashed by a third, but Australia remains the biggest donor in the Pacific with $1.7 billion set aside for the region a year.Solomon Islands receives about $170 million of that, but its share has fallen since the end of RAMSI — Australia's multi-year assistance mission to the nation.Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has also warned Solomon Islands it has put its sovereignty at risk by signing a security agreement with China.Mr Joyce said he had taken the Solomon Islands' word that it would not allow China to establish a naval base on the island, but that, if it did, it would be ""obviously an intimidating tactic"" for Australia.""[China wants] to. There's no doubt about that because we see what they did in the South China Sea where they said they weren't going to militarise,"" he said.""Obviously for the Solomons, I take their word but I say be really careful to invite a totalitarian power into your country because it's going to affect your sovereignty.""Mr Joyce again defended the Prime Minister and the government's attempts to engage with Solomon Islands leadership before the deal was signed.However, he also would not say how Australia would respond if China did begin to build a military base because the country had said it would not happen.When asked what a re-elected Liberal and Nationals Coalition would do to stop China from encroaching further into the pacific, the Deputy Prime Minister pointed to projects — such as the nuclear submarine deal, AUKUS, the Quad alliance between Australia, India, Japan and the US — as examples of things the government was doing to prevent that.The government has faced sustained criticism from the opposition about the deal, with Labor arguing that the Coalition should have done more to prevent it, including sending Foreign Minister Marise Payne to Solomon Islands when concerns about the pact first arose last year.","Australia, China, Federal Election, Federal Elections, Federal Government, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, India, Japan, Solomon Islands, United Kingdom, United States, ",2022-04-24T01:19:50+00:00

nation's economic problems. ""It doesn't provide any quick return or indeed, any return to the country and its people and so in that respect, it is seen to be a situation of buying influence,"" he said. The Solomon Islands has inked a security pact with China which could lead to a Chinese naval base in the South Pacific. It's a slap in the face for countries like Australia and India, which are looking to reduce their dependency on China and its influence in the Indo-Pacific region. But with China strengthening its hold in the Asia-Pacific for several years already, it may be too late. After Sri Lanka's civil war ended in 2009, the country was facing the daunting task of rebuilding after thousands of deaths and almost 30 years of fighting. Sri Lanka's then-president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is now Prime Minister, had a vision to develop the country and usher in new jobs.But he needed help to get there, and the Chinese government was waiting in the wings to assist. ""The Sri Lankan government moved towards a kind of post-war reconstruction boom and the Chinese were on hand with the cash — with the liquid cash — to help us to do that,"" Mr Saravanamuttu said.""The Chinese also provided diplomatic protection to the government of Sri Lanka internationally in terms of war crimes and crimes against humanity."" Both sides in the civil war — the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers separatist group — have been accused of atrocities.The UN has been collecting evidence against Sri Lanka alleging it committed war crimes, something its government denies.But China was among a few countries that abstained on voting on a UN motion to accuse Sri Lanka of ""obstructing accountability"". It's a tried and tested method for the Chinese government: Negotiate investments in countries facing war and in desperate need of help. It has made similar moves in post-war African nations, and equipped countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan with military equipment — the latter now calls China a close strategic ally. In the Maldives, just 980 kilometres by sea from Sri Lanka, China has signed a free trade agreement, while encouraging its citizens and businesses to invest in the tropical nation.China has also invested in road and housing construction, the expansion of a power station, and a bridge-building project, among other initiatives in the tropical paradise.In 2017, Sri Lanka signed a $1.1 billion deal with China for the control of a deep-sea port in Hambantota, in the country's south. There were concerns that the port could be used by the Chinese military, but Sri Lanka needed the money to pay off its already growing foreign loans.Many of the debts were to Beijing itself.China promised it would only run commercial operations from the port, and a state-run company was given a 99-year lease. It led to protests and critics calling Sri Lanka a ""Chinese colony"".China has now invested billions of dollars in the country.""I wouldn't say Sri Lanka is a Chinese colony, but it is correct to say that China exerts a very different influence on the overall economic and political environment in Sri Lanka,"" Mr Saravanamuttu said. ""The Chinese have an interest in the maritime waterways around Sri Lanka, because a lot of their energy supplies goes through [there]. ""They are wanting to ensure ... that there will always be stable government in Sri Lanka ... the Chinese are now part of the Sri Lankan political architecture, and there is no way in which one can get rid of them."" The United States calls this ""debt-trap diplomacy"", but some researchers say it's more nuanced than that.""China is slowly emerging to being the new superpower in the South Asian region,"" said R Ramakumar, a professor of economics at Mumbai's Tata Institute.""But these are large commercial contracts being built across this region, these countries are tipped to benefit from these loans as well."" Sri Lanka's economic crisis has been caused by huge foreign debts, some to China, others to Japan, India and major investment firms.The country has officially asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for emergency financial help, but China is not offering much support for a problem experts say it partly helped create. ""In this particular crisis that Sri Lanka is going through where we desperately need assistance, China has distanced itself somewhat and said, 'Go to the IMF,'"" Mr Saravanamuttu explained. ""Because if they were to bail out Sri Lanka, they probably will have a queue of other countries lining up to get similar assistance."" India and Australia have joined the US and Japan in a security pact called the Quad, which officials have all-but confirmed is a strategy to stand firm against China. ""There's a panda in the room,"" Australia's High Commissioner to India Barry O'Farrell said of the pact.But researchers like Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu have said the animosity towards China needs to be reassessed, because the country has already locked itself into the region. ""The Chinese will look at the existing international economic systems as less of a threat if they are not being sort of made out to be some predatory, regional superpower that's trying to gobble up countries in the region,"" he said. ""So it's working out a way in which we can involve the Chinese [to] ... contain it [the rivalry] to competition and not let it spill over into conflict.""","China, Defence and National Security, Economic and Social Development, Maldives, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Unrest, Conflict and War,

His claim of foreign policy superiority has been tarnished.By inking a security pact with Solomon Islands, China furthers two objectives.Firstly, it establishes a basis on which it could potentially build a Chinese naval base in the South Pacific.Secondly, the agreement is a strategic hit on Australia and the United States which talked up its Pacific ""pivot"" more than a decade ago under Barack Obama. The US hasn't even had an embassy in Honiara for 29 years.With exquisite timing, Chinese President Xi Jinping has poked Morrison squarely in the eye.The Prime Minister presents national security and regional uncertainty as one of his electoral trump cards.Morrison is proud to have called for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19, and for using the world stage to call out China's economic coercion. He has been vocal in his criticism of Beijing's cyber intrusions both here and abroad.And not long before calling the election, he weaponised China, declaring in Parliament that the Deputy Labor leader Richard Marles was a ""Manchurian candidate"", suggesting — foolishly — that Beijing's preferred outcome was for the Opposition to win.His political charge against Labor? That only Morrison had the courage and the steadfast guard to protect Australian sovereignty and interests.Yet under Morrison's watch, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has spurned concerted Australian pressure to seal a security agreement that undermines long-standing regional objectives.Foreign Minister Marise Payne was not dispatched. Labor says this was neglect.In the context of the Solomons skirmish, Beijing has won a contest with Canberra with wits and dollars — lots of them.Whether the security agreement is in Solomon Islands' long-term interests is highly dubious.But it is personally humiliating to Morrison that his parliamentary flourish targeting Marles has been so quickly exposed.More importantly, it is a blow to policy aims of the joint Australian-American Pacific project — aims that will live on whoever wins the May 21 poll.Penny Wong calls it ""the worst failure of Australian foreign policy in the Pacific since the end of World War II"".This is a somewhat hyperbolic assessment but understandable given the pressure cooker atmosphere of an election campaign and the way Morrison has used China policy as a sword against the ALP.The diplomatic corps and foreign service is less scathing but no less worried.When Australia sent police and military personnel to quell violent unrest in Honiara, there was an obvious bind: by quickly restoring peace, Australia didn't want to be seen as propping up a Solomons government that faced legitimate civilian disquiet.The concern now is that in signing a security agreement with China, Sogavare will see Beijing as a better guarantor for the future of Solomon Islands and his government.Solomon Islands Opposition Leader Matthew Wale, who says he warned Australian officials of the military pact as early as August last year, suggests Canberra has been naive.""I am extremely disappointed in Australia, the Australian government has been too soft on this issue and too trusting,"" Wale told the ABC.At high levels in the Australian establishment, the view of Sogavare is not complimentary: a thin-skinned and paranoid leader with a personal resentment against Australia who seriously overestimates his abilities and strategic prowess.The Australian hope is that Sogavare has seriously miscalculated resistance inside his own Cabinet and objections within the Solomons police force, many of whom do not want Chinese equipment or training. By dividing the Solomon Islands community and stoking political and ethnic fault lines, the worry is that Sogavare may once again take his nation to another security emergency.The pact with China might be tested soon enough, as well as the strains in Sogavare's regime.China has been looking for regional strategic opportunities for years. Until now, they've been largely foiled.Australia spent $100 million to fund an expansion of Fiji's Blackrock military camp, to outmuscle China from the project in 2018.  The same year, Australia convinced the Solomons to scrap a 2016 contract with Chinese company Huawei to build an undersea high speed internet link to the Australian mainland.  And the Federal Government had a hand in convincing Telstra to buy Digicel Pacific, the biggest mobile operator in the South Pacific, to prevent the company being bought by China Mobile.""We were bound to lose at some point,"" one high-ranking bureaucrat told the ABC.Morrison today suggested that Solomon Islands' security pact with China was greased with cash and other incentives.""What this highlights is that over the last five years in particular, the level of interference and the level of engagement and particularly, you know, with all sorts of promises of all sorts of investments that can be very, that can be very persuasive,"" the PM said.By comparison, Australia could not be ""fully persuasive"", Morrison said, but ""Australia will be there for you as we always are, not because we want anything from you, but because we see the Pacific as our family and we want to stand by our family and ensure that they can have the sovereignty that they have earned, that they believe in very strongly.""Whether the next PM is Morrison or Anthony Albanese, the job in the Solomons is to influence how the security pact is put into operation, if it cannot be unpicked: a reminder that the regional strategic challenges will persist long after a six-week election campaign.","Australia, China, Federal Elections, Federal Government, Federal Parliament, Foreign Affairs, International Aid and Trade, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-04-20T06:50:28+00:00

dollars in Chinese infrastructure investment in the developing countryEarlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison dismissed suggestions that his government had dropped the ball on its relationship with Solomon Islands after a leaked draft of the security pact took Australia by surprise.Mr Morrison insisted Australia continued to work closely with Honiara, despite the Australian government currently operating in caretaker mode during the election campaign.""We will continue to work through these sensitive issues as a Pacific Islands family,"" Mr Morrison said.""The suggestion that Australia should be heavy-handed on these matters is wrongheaded and completely misunderstands how these matters should be handled.""Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday the security cooperation between China and Solomon Islands would complement existing agreements and be ""beneficial"" for both Solomon Islands and the South Pacific region.""[The agreement] is beneficial to social stability and lasting security of Solomon Islands and conducive to promoting peace, stability and development of Solomon Islands and the South Pacific region,"" Mr Zhao said.""Relevant countries should view this in an objective and reasonable light, and respect the sovereignty and independent choice of China and Solomon Islands.""Instead of stoking confrontation and creating division among the Pacific island countries and the region, they should do more things that is good for regional peace, stability and development.""The visiting Commandant of the US Marine Corp, David Berger, has highlighted the geographic importance of Solomon Islands, while warning the West is failing to block China's gradual advances across the Indo-Pacific.""You could argue that the approaches that we've taken in the last 10 years are not working out here,"" General Berger said in an appearance at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.""They're moving forward. They're not picking a fight. They're achieving their objectives. We're not successfully deterring it because — what some people call grey-zone or however you want to call it — we haven't figured out quite how to stop that.""General Berger also highlighted the modern-day strategic importance of Solomon Islands, pointing to its significance during the pivotal World War II Battle of Guadalcanal. ""Where the Solomon Islands are, matters,"" he said. ""It did then. It does now. ""The Solomon Islands, their location matters. It's clearly a point of contention and competition.""Asked whether Australia had failed, diplomatically, to stop the proposed Chinese security deal, General Berger responded: ""It's not for me to judge pass or fail. It does highlight the strategic location of

We've seen it in many other countries around the world. ""Australia is a respected partner with the Solomon Islands. We've provided support to them. We'll continue to do that, because they're family, but we operate by a different set of rules.""The controversial pact between Solomon Islands and China featured in Wednesday night's first leader's debate between Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese.During the debate, the Opposition Leader labelled a suggestion from the Prime Minister that Labor was siding with China on issues of national security as ""an outrageous slur"".Senator Wong said Labor has been clear in its position on China, and recognised the ""increased aggression"" displayed towards Australia.One of Labor's central criticisms of the Coalition's handling of the Solomon Islands deal is that the Prime Minister should have dispatched his Foreign Minister, Marise Payne, to Honiara to try to steer the government away from its partnership with Beijing, rather than send his more-junior Minister for the Pacific, Zed Seselja.Mr Morrison said that was appropriate, given the sensitivities of the situation, and did not want to be seen as ""stomping"" all over Solomon Islands.Senator Wong said that claim was hypocritical.""He was happy to tell them what to do when he pushed back on climate,"" Senator Wong said.""He was happy to tell them what to do when he turned up to a Pacific Leaders Forum and pushed the leaders hard to take out reference to the climate crisis, which they wanted to put in. ""So Mr Morrison is very selective about when he wants to throw his weight around.""The United States' former ambassador to Solomon Islands said countries such as Australia should have seen China muscling in to the Pacific on the horizon.Catherine Ebert-Gray was Washington's envoy between 2016 and 2019.""We probably should have been a little more prepared for this type of an agreement,"" she said.""We've all been aware that China's interested in more defence activity and partnership, and they've come around to other Pacific nations. ""It was probably bound to happen somewhere, but it is interesting that Solomon Islands, just two years ago, recognised Taiwan, and here they are in a security agreement with China.""Ambassador Ebert-Gray said it should prompt a rethink in how countries, including Australia, deal with their Pacific neighbours.""We probably needed to be more direct, we probably have should have stepped up and [in] other ways too, not just security,"" she said.""I think what Prime Minister Sogavare is looking for is more support, rebuilding his nation, helping his people in remote areas, helping his economy and his security.""On whether it would give China a greater military footprint in the South Pacific, Ambassador Ebert-Gray said it was ""too soon to predict that"".""Hopefully, Solomon Islands will be wise enough to balance this relationship,"" she said.""That's what's going to be important that we continue to be good partners, and we continue to be there when they need us.""","Australia, China, Defence and National Security, Federal Election, Federal Elections, Federal Government, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Solomon Islands, ",2022-04-21T00:13:12+00:00

signing of a pact with a small faraway country to supposedly help maintain domestic stability in Solomon Islands is a very curious deal. Beijing's public assurances that the agreement isn't aimed at any third country, along with Solomons' Prime Minister Mannasseh Sogavare's statement that it won't involve a Chinese military base, are little comfort to Australia, as the details remain secret. China has never done a deal like this with a South Pacific country, but another secretive agreement last year to upgrade an airstrip in Kiribati hints at the strategic intent behind it. Beijing has done two other security-focused deals in different parts of the world, one that resulted in China's first overseas military base, in Djibouti. The benefits of playing off larger powers against each other for economic and domestic security gains are obvious for Honiara.But the question ""what's in it for Beijing?"" is prompting deep anxiety as Beijing's rivalry with Australia's chief ally, the United States, intensifies. The text of the draft agreement answered that question. The draft deal, leaked in late March, would have set a legal framework for Chinese naval ships to dock and be replenished in Solomon Islands. Chinese police and military personnel could be invited by Solomon Islands to protect security, including China's economic interests. Has that language been watered down in the signed, final agreement to appease Australia's fears of a People's Liberation Army Navy presence 2,000 kilometres to the north-east?We don't know.Beijing, it appears, more so than Mr Sogavare's government, is keeping it secret. ""Non-interference is a general principle,"" said Shi Yinhong, an international relations analyst at Beijing's Renmin University. ""But it doesn't preclude China from doing anything if it's at the invitation of the local sovereign government."" Solomon Islands is a sovereign nation, but a small and relatively impoverished one that's just done a deal with a giant. With just 700,000 people and an annual GDP of $US1.5 billion, the long-term fear is that the current or future governments of the country might, in the face of economic pressure, cede the power to offer ""invitations"" to China itself. ""I think China is very good at picking soft targets,"" said Kuo Yujen of Taiwan's National Sun Yat-sen University.He believes the security pact is undoubtedly aimed at securing a ""military-civilian harbour"" for China, while the secretive deal last year to upgrade an airstrip in Kiribati, south of Hawaii, aims to put China in prime position to monitor America's Pacific naval activity. ""I believe in the very near future we will witness the Chinese PLA Navy having very frequent voyages all the way to the South Pacific, and then having logistics and access bases in the surrounding waters,"" he told the ABC.A common theme among security analysts is that we're going to have to get used to Chinese warships patrolling what was long viewed by Australians as ""our patch"". China's military is building naval ships at unprecedented speed for peacetime.It's all part of President Xi Jinping's ""great rejuvenation"" goal to restore China as a leading — if not the leading — power on Earth. Already the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has surpassed the US for the largest fleet in the world.A US Congressional Research Service report last month estimated China now has 355 battle-force ""platforms"" including aircraft carriers, surface combat ships, submarines and mine-warfare ships.The speed of ship-building goes well beyond the needs of China's immediate coastal areas and its various territorial disputes.""The PLAN's overall battle force is expected to grow to 420 ships by 2025 and 460 ships by 2030,"" the report said, noting America's deployment of greater resources to the Pacific in response. A military base established in the Horn of Africa in 2016, officially to help anti-piracy operations, broke Beijing's long-held aversion to bases on foreign soil. ""Non-interference"" remained China's mantra, a contrast to America's foreign policy.But it was now ""non-interference by invitation"". Another deal with Cambodia in 2019 to give China's military access to a Gulf of Tonkin naval facility, despite official denials, further set the direction. US dominance has long relied on bases and military access agreements abroad, so it's little surprise that China now appears to be using a similar playbook. The change has been accompanied by increasing official rhetoric about the need to protect China's economic and infrastructure interests abroad. Chinese leader Xi Jinping's Cold War-style obsession with the United States is feeding into the timing of the Solomons deal.With Xi's officials and state media now blaming the US for everything from Russia's war In Ukraine to the origins of the coronavirus, it appears Beijing announced the security pact this week to pre-empt a visit to Honiara by the Biden administration's Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell.Just three weeks ago, Xi's military signed yet another secretive army agreement with Cambodia, despite American efforts to persuade Cambodia's government against it. While America's military is locking in more closely with Australia through deals like AUKUS, it's been a rough few weeks for Washington's efforts to counter China's growing sway. But the contest for power and influence between the two giants is still only warming up, and none of Australia's South Pacific neighbours can avoid being swept up in it. The Solomons deal might be the wake-up call Australians need to understand how fast the region is changing. ","Asia, Australia, China, Defence Forces, Foreign Affairs, Navy, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Unrest,

Islands has pressed ahead and signed a security pact with China – a deal Australia, New Zealand and the US fear could open the door to a Chinese naval base in the South Pacific.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin announced the agreement in Beijing on Tuesday evening, saying it would involve China cooperating with Honiara on maintaining social order, protecting people's safety, aid, combating natural disasters and helping safeguard national security.Solomon Islands Foreign Affairs Minister Jeremiah Manele confirmed the signing of the pact to the ABC in a text message.He said Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare would make a formal announcement in the coming days.The announcement comes just days after Australia's Minister for the Pacific Zed Seselja travelled to Honiara and met the country's Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare in a last-ditch effort to dissuade him from going ahead with the China security deal.Senator Seselja and Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the government was ""disappointed"" by the agreement and that it was not reached in a transparent way.""Ultimately, this is a sovereign decision of the government of Solomon Islands and we absolutely recognised that, but … declarations and these engagements on security issues have been dealt with in a Pacific-wide manner,"" she said.""That is the traditional approach for these issues and it's why some Pacific partners have also raised concerns.""Senator Payne said the government's position was still that Pacific neighbours were the best to delivery security in the region and said it was an ""unfair characterisation"" to say the region had become less secure while Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been in power.The ministers said while Solomon Islands had the right to make sovereign decisions about national security, Australia still believed the ""Pacific family"" was best placed to provide security guarantees.They also flagged that Australia would continue to press Solomon Islands not to turn to China in the event of a security crisis.When Honiara was rocked by violent riots in November, Australia responded rapidly to a request for help from Mr Sogavare, sending police and ADF personnel to the city to restore order.China has also repeatedly insisted that it has no intention of displacing other countries in Solomon Islands, although both Canberra and Washington are deeply sceptical of that claim.Mr Wang said the cooperation would be transparent and would not target any third party.""The purpose of China-Solomon security cooperation is to promote social stability and long-term peace and security in Solomon Islands, which is in line with the common interests of Solomon Islands and the South Pacific region,"" he told a briefing on Tuesday.""China-Solomon Islands security cooperation is public, transparent, open and inclusive, not directed at any third party, and is parallel to and complementary to the existing bilateral and multilateral security cooperation mechanisms in Solomon Islands.""China is willing to work with the countries concerned to give full play to their respective advantages and form international synergies.""Earlier on Tuesday, the Solomon Islands parliament was told China would send officials to the Pacific nation next month to sign cooperation agreements.""The PRC [People's Republic of China] foreign affairs is heading to Honiara in the middle of May to sign multilateral agreements and cooperations with the Solomon Islands government,"" Douglas Ete, chairman of the public accounts committee, said.The announcement came only a few days before senior White House official Kurt Campbell was due to visit Honiara as part of a concerted effort by both Australia and the US to dissuade Solomon Islands from pressing ahead with the pact.On Monday, the US State Department warned that the pact ""leaves open the door for the deployment of PRC military forces to the Solomon Islands"" and set a ""concerning precedent for the wider Pacific island region"".One diplomatic source told the ABC that the announcement was ""clearly pushed through"" by both countries ahead of Mr Campbell's visit.Mr Wang questioned why the US was

will get no support in the region,"" he said.""Attempts to meddle with and obstruct Pacific island countries' cooperation with China will be in vain.""While Mr Sogavare has declared that his country will not allow China to build a military base there, the broadly worded draft text leaked last month leaves the door open for Beijing to send troops to Solomon Islands to protect Chinese built infrastructure.It also says China can “carry out ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands"".New Zealand academic and Pacific security expert Anna Powles told the ABC that the final text was “unlikely” to be made public, “consistent with other PRC security agreements”.“We are also unlikely to know, unless the agreement is leaked again, whether the signed version varies substantially from the leaked draft,” Dr Powles said.“This means critical questions remain unanswered about the nature and scope of a potential deployment of Chinese security personnel to Solomon Islands, what exactly is meant by a logistical supply base in Solomon Islands, and how will mission creep be prevented?”The Opposition in Solomon Islands is also pushing for more transparency.Leading Opposition MP Peter Kenilorea Jr told the ABC he would use his position as Chairman of the parliament’s Foreign Relations Committee to hold hearings with foreign affairs officials to “explain the terms of the agreement"".“This issue is not just a sovereign one for Solomon Islands. It impacts the Indo-Pacific region,” he said.“I would like the text to be made public. Australia’s and Solomon Islands’ security treaty is accessible in the public domain, so why should this treaty with China be secret?”The announcement is also expected to have domestic political ramifications in Australia in the lead up to the federal election next month.Labor slammed the Coalition's handling of the issue in the wake of the announcement, with Shadow Foreign Minister Penny Wong accusing the Prime Minister of bungling a key relationship.“Despite all of his tough talk, on Scott Morrison’s watch our region has become less secure,” she said on Twitter.“His government was warned of this security pact in August and he hasn’t even bothered to send the Foreign Minister to the Solomon Islands to raise concerns on behalf of all Australians.""The United States also says it is has concerns over the deal and will raise them later in the week.A spokesperson for the National Security Council said a US delegation would speak with Solomon Islands about the prospect of China building a military presence in the country.""We are concerned by the lack of transparency and unspecified nature of this agreement, which follows a pattern of China offering shadowy, vague deals with little regional consultation in fishing, resource management, development assistance and now security practices,"" the spokesperson said.""The reported signing does not change our concerns, and that of regional allies and partners, and it does not change our commitment to a strong relationship with the region.""Although Solomon Islands has said it will not allow China to build a military base, we will still raise our concerns as part of our broader efforts to reinforce our longstanding ties with the Solomon Islands.""","Asia, Australia, China, Defence and National Security, Foreign Affairs, Pacific, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-04-19T08:38:17+00:00

The Pacific Islands are very sensitive to that and I have always had an approach with the Pacific Islands which understands those sensitivities because there is a lot at stake.""The Prime Minister also said the whole region had been facing ""intense"" approaches from China, saying Beijing made ""all sorts of promises"" and ""all sorts of investments"" in the Pacific which could be ""very persuasive"". ""That is the challenge that we're now dealing with and we have been dealing with it for many years. It is not a new issue and these threats still remain"" he said.""I speak to other Pacific leaders about it all the time and ... you can't always be fully persuasive on these issues.""What I assure them about is that Australia will be there for you as we always are, not because we want anything from you, but because we see the Pacific as our family.""Australia, New Zealand and the United States have all expressed concern about the precedent the situation could set for other small Pacific nations.Australia's spy chiefs were also sent to Honiara to ventilate Australia's concerns about the pact.Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare took to the floor of parliament this morning to defend the pact, declaring that his government went into the agreement with its ""eyes wide open"". Mr Sogavare also suggested the agreement would help bolster the police force in Solomon Islands, which has already received riot gear and replica guns from Chinese police. ""We intend to beef up and strengthen our police capability to deal with any future instability by properly equipping the police to take full responsibility of the country's security responsibilities, in the hope we will never be required to invoke any of our bilateral security arrangements,"" he said. When asked if he'd be willing to release the full text of the agreement he gave an ambiguous response, saying it was the ""way to go"" but also saying he had to consult with China before making a decision.Beijing typically does not release the text of its bilateral security agreements with other countries. In a statement, Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the US National Security Council, said the US convened a meeting with senior officials from Australia, Japan and New Zealand.""The officials reaffirmed the four countries' enduring and shared commitment to the Pacific Islands,"" she said.""The United States resolved to intensify its engagement in the region to meet 21st-century challenges.""Officials from the four countries represented also shared concerns about a proposed security framework between the Solomon Islands and the People's Republic of China and its serious risks to a free and open Indo-Pacific.""Foreign Minister Marise Payne rejected Senator Wong's assessment that inaction by the Morrison government had fuelled the situation.""I think that's an unfair characterisation, and I don't think it recognises the sovereign decisions that governments, of course, make for themselves,"" she said.""We are looking at very serious geo-strategic challenges in our region, and they are realities.""Senator Payne insisted that Australia still played a significant role in the South Pacific.""We firmly believe that the Pacific family is best placed to meet the security needs of our region — and we've consistently said that and, more importantly, we've consistently demonstrated that,"" Senator Payne said.However, she argued, the governments in Honiara and Beijing needed to provide more detail about exactly what the security deal would allow for.""In relation to this agreement, we see a lack of transparency"" she said.""This has not been agreed in an open and transparent way, not been consulted, for example, across the region.""Top US official Kurt Campbell is slated to visit Solomon Islands later this week, as the United States warned of the ""concerning precedent"" the security deal set.Senator Payne said she was pleased the trip was going ahead, but avoided speculation about whether the deal could be undone.""That's a matter for the parties,"" she said.","Australia, China, Defence and National Security, Federal Government, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, New Zealand, Samoa, Security Intelligence, Solomon Islands, Tonga, United States, Vanuatu, ",2022-04-19T22:14:13+00:00

As host country, we had an obligation to protect all embassies including [the] Chinese embassy,"" the memo said. ""In this regard, we have no objection to the request."" However, Solomon Islands government sources have told the ABC the offer was later rejected by Mr Sogavare's cabinet, but they did not provide details. The government of Solomon Islands may have hesitated because it has not typically allowed foreign embassies and high commissions to deploy their own armed personnel for protection.In his note, Mr Beck acknowledged the proposed shift, writing that China's request ""sadly — sets a precedent.""However, he still recommended pressing ahead, and said that China was a ""special case"" because ""public debate was and remains directed against China's interests in the country"". Mr Beck also said the deployment would last for ""six to 12 months"", although there is no reference to this time frame in the Chinese embassy documents.While armed Australian police and army personnel remain in Honiara as part of an international assistance team, they are under the direction of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force, rather than the Australian embassy.It is not clear whether they provide regular protection to any diplomatic compounds in the city. Leak of the documents also demonstrates how internal anger over the government's planned security pact with China is further destabilising politics in Solomon Islands.The leaked documents were released by a group called ""Public Servants for Transparency"", who are pitching themselves as Solomon Islands officials opposed to both the security agreement and corruption in the government.The ABC has not been able to independently verify the identify of those in the group.However, in a statement the group warns there may be more leaks to come, declaring they have ""supporters all over government"" with ""similar stories to tell"".They also urged Mr Sogavare to ignore advice from senior officials in favour of the deal.The ABC has sought comment from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Solomon Islands, the Chinese embassy in Honiara and the Australian government. None has yet responded to the request.Late on Tuesday, Mr Sogavare's office issued a statement berating those behind the leak, saying they were ""hell bent on creating instability for their own interests"".He also said that the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force would issue a statement.","Australia, China, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Solomon Islands, Unrest, Conflict and War, ",2022-04-12T05:21:47+00:00

countries,"" the statement says.""Solomon Islands reassured Australia that its security concerns are domestically focused and compliments current bilateral security Agreement with Australia and the regional security architecture.""The statement called the meeting a ""talanoa"" session, using a word which means an inclusive and transparent dialogue designed to share perspectives and reach agreements based on mutual respect.It also declared that ""Australia remains our partner of choice"" and said trust was ""being cemented between the two sovereign states"".But there was no indication in the statement that Mr Sogavare's government is willing to soften its position or abandon the deeply contentious agreement with China.The statement pointedly says that China remains an ""important trading partner for both countries"" and makes it clear that the government is not prepared to abandon efforts to strike security pacts with more countries.""Prime Minister Sogavare assured Australia, Solomon Islands will continue to roll out the implementation of its National Security Strategy and uphold its Foreign Policy of ""Friends to all and enemies to none,"" it reads.Several Australian government ministers have publicly raised concerns about the pact since it was leaked online last month.It has since been ""initialled"" by top officials from China and Solomon Islands, but not yet signed and formalised by their foreign ministers.Last month, Mr Morrison said the agreement showed the ""constant pressure"" being placed on Pacific states, and earlier this week a top US admiral

Australia for publicly criticising the deal, accusing it of paranoia and trying to undermine the sovereignty of Solomon Islands.Mr Morrison and the Pacific Minister Zed Seselja have rung several Pacific counterparts to try and coordinate a united regional response to the development.Some Pacific Island nations are also uneasy about the agreement and the prospect of China striking its first bilateral security deal in the region, although few Pacific leaders have waded into the public furore.The Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea James Marape told the ABC earlier this week that other states in the region were ""conscious"" of events in Solomon Islands and wanted to discuss the matter at the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting this year.Samoa's Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mataʻafa

been pushing for the Forum to quickly come together and to be looking at these issues growing and deepening in our region,"" she said.The controversy over the agreement has also stoked domestic political controversy in Australia.The government has denied Labor's declaration that Australia was ""blindsided"" by the leaked deal, with Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce saying Australian

It has the vote in the UN system,"" she said.Essentially China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually need to be reunified, while Taiwan sees itself as a democracy.In 2019, Solomon Islands struck a new diplomatic deal with China and ended its 36 year relationship with Taiwan.Taiwan has worked hard to create alliances in the Pacific, but China has won over many of its allies and encouraged them to adopt the One-China policy.Countries who acknowledge the policy do not have an official diplomatic relationship with Taiwan.But not everyone in Solomon Islands has been happy about Beijing’s growing influence.Last year, violent protests broke out in the capital Honiara, and they were, in part, linked to the growing ties with China and the split with Taiwan.Under Australia's existing security agreement with Solomon Islands, troops and police were sent to Honiara to help quell the violence at the request of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare.In a speech to Parliament defending the proposed security agreement, Prime Minister Sogavare said while Solomon Islands' traditional security partners including Australia remained important, Honiara wished to diversify its partners to ""achieve our security needs"".According to Dr Kabutaulaka, whose research focuses on China in the Pacific, Solomon Islands could benefit from the proposed security agreement with Beijing.""Australia provides a lot [of security support] but not enough to enable the police to operate, particularly in a country that is geographically dispersed,"" he said.But Dr Kabutaulaka said China was not only supplying equipment, it was providing police training, and it was important to question if Beijing's policing model was appropriate for Solomon Islands. ""I don't see that discussion taking place [in Solomon Islands] in this case,"" Dr Kabutaulaka said.""I think that there is simply an assumption that what works in China works everywhere else and therefore, should be exported, so that's my concern,"" he said.While Australia remains the biggest aid donor to Solomon Islands, experts say the country could benefit economically from establishing closer ties to China.""I think they have the opportunity to use China's source of economic aid, especially in terms of infrastructure development,"" Dr Guan said.However, she warned Solomon Islands would need to be able to manage its relationship with China, and avoid any pitfalls such as potential debt traps.Managing the rivalry between the great powers may prove more complex for Solomon Islands.""The question more for [Pacific Island countries] is having the capacity to be able to manage these relationships and accepting that they are going to be caught up in this geopolitical rivalry,"" Dr Kabutaulaka said. Dr Kabutaulaka said there was great excitement within Solomon Islands' government about the opportunities the relationship with China could offer, ""because they see the kind of money that could potentially come in"".""But there is no attempt to really understand how the Chinese state works,"" he said.Read the story in Chinese: 阅读中文版本","Australia, China, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, New Zealand, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-04-06T20:57:48+00:00

But anytime that a secret security arrangement makes its way into the light of day, it is a concern,"" he told the ABC in Washington DC, during an event with foreign journalists.""And it's a concern for all of our partners throughout the western Pacific and notably, Australia, New Zealand. ""And so that revealed security arrangement in the Solomons is very concerning to us.""Last week Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare lashed out at critics of the draft Chinese security saying their comments were ""insulting"".Mr Sogavare said the deal was ""ready to be signed"" but insisted existing security arrangements with Australia would be maintained and there were no plans to allow a Chinese military base.Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape has also weighed into the controversy over the security agreement. Australia has been trying to rally Pacific Island states to press Solomon Islands over the pact, with Scott Morrison ringing regional heavyweights including Mr Marape and Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama to express concern. Mr Marape told the ABC that PNG and other Pacific states were ""conscious of what's taking place"" in Solomon Islands, and he had had ""conversations"" with his Solomon Islands counterpart. He said Mr Sogavare assured him there were no plans for China to establish a military base in the country, and that the agreement was focused on offering police support.But Mr Marape also suggested that Papua New Guinea and other Pacific countries were in the best position to provide police support, saying ""we stand ready to work side by side in upskilling and training police [and] having more police engagements ... into Solomon Islands if they require help"".Australian and Papuan police are already in Honiara as part of a regional police mission to help stabilise the country in the wake of the riots last year. Admiral Paparo backed warnings from Defence Minister Peter Dutton of a growing potential for armed conflict in the Indo-Pacific region that Australians needed to be ""realistic"" about.""I always operate under the notion that there's the potential of conflict within our region within a couple of years because of the incredible unpredictability of events,"" Admiral Paparo said. ""And who last year could have predicted where Eastern Europe would be right now. In fact, that is our mission, is to always be ready as militaries.""Admiral Paparo described the AUKUS arrangement, under which Australia will obtain nuclear-powered submarines through a deal with the US and the UK, as a ""tangible sign"" of rising tensions in the region. He also warned that China would be watching Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the context of its own claims over Taiwan. ""Undoubtedly, the PRC (People's Republic of China) is watching what's happened in Ukraine and taking notes and learning from it,"" he said. ""And there will be learning and there will be adjustments to the extent that they're able to learn from it. ""And they will improve their capabilities based on what they learn at this time."" In Sydney, Defence Minister Peter Dutton has again emphasised growing military risks in the region, while announcing details of a new multi-billion-dollar missiles package.""There was a working assumption that an act of aggression by China toward Taiwan might take place in the 2040s — I think that timeline has now been dramatically compressed,"" Mr Dutton said.""And when we look at what has happened in Ukraine, there is the prospect of Russia going into Poland or somewhere else in Europe, and that would be a repeat of the 1930s, and that's not something that we should allow to happen.""Mr Dutton confirmed the federal government would fast track the purchase of US-made joint air-to-surface standoff missiles for Australia's Super Hornets, and Norwegian Naval Strike Missiles for warships.US Defence giants Raytheon and Lockheed Martin have also been announced as leading the $1 billion sovereign guided weapons program, with the aim of eventually producing missiles domestically.","Australia, Federal Government, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Solomon Islands, United States, Unrest, Conflict and War, ",2022-04-05T03:20:09+00:00

But if you're married and have a family or you have a spouse, then you are entitled,"" she said.""That even flows to some of the health workers, who might think if a young girl comes in and is not married, then they are not entitled to contraception.""In some countries, Dr Duro-Aina said, a ""culture of silence"" and a fear of retribution from partners also drove women away from using contraceptives.""It's like sexual health is something we in the Pacific shouldn't be talking about freely,"" she said.""Women have had to do it privately because they didn't want their husbands to know.""In the case the spouse has known, it's led to some degree of domestic or gender-based violence against them and the health worker who gave the service.""On top of that, Dr Duro-Aina said women also had to deal with misinformation that was circulated about contraceptives, like claims they cause cancer.Contraceptives are ""critical"" to empowering Pacific Island women and improving their status in the region, Dr Duro-Aina said. ""The fact is that when women are able to use contraceptives, then they are better empowered,"" she said.""Girls can stay in school and get an education. They can get jobs and then provide for their families.""And then we're able to lift the levels of our women globally, and especially in the Pacific.""The UNFPA provides contraceptives to 14 Pacific Island countries, administered through public health facilities.Dr Duro-Aina said various short and long-acting methods were available to women, including:""Contraception is like a basket of fruits, you're able to choose what one suits you best,"" she said.Someone who has witnessed the impacts firsthand, working alongside women as an obstetrics and gynaecology specialist, is Dr Freda Wemin.Dr Wemin is based in Goroka, Papua New Guinea, which has a low rate of contraceptive use.Only 37 per cent of married women and 18 per cent of sexually active single women use a form of contraception.And this has had dire consequences for young women and girls.""They fall pregnant, and they end up doing unsafe abortions,"" she said.""We have lost women dying of sepsis doing abortions themselves and not coming and getting help on time because of the stigma attached to it.""Last year we had three who died from doing terminations.""Dr Wemin said more than 50 per cent of women who died in hospitals in Papua New Guinea had cervical cancer. The second biggest killer of women was sepsis.""It is usually the ones who deliver in the village, or they do abortions and they become very sick,"" she said.Papua New Guinea has the highest rates of maternal death in the Pacific.More than 2,000 women die in childbirth each year and women, on average, have four babies.Dr Wemin said more work needed to be done to educate women about the costs associated with having more children.""A lot of women would like to equalise the gender of the children, so it is balanced, so if they have one or the other, they keep having babies to get the balance,"" she said.""We educate on the economic benefits of having a good number of children, then people will make informed choices about the size of their family.""We're very proactive in providing services, but it depends on the individuals.""Even in town where they have access to it in a five- or 10-minute walk to the facility, they don't come because they're engaged with daily living.""Ms Wemin said upskilling community healthcare workers who worked with ""the bulk of the population"" in Goroka would help address the knowledge gap around contraceptives and family planning.""The program covers obstetrics emergencies, family planning and all the things that they need to do to address and refer patients [to hospital],"" she said.""That's an ongoing program and we will continue to do that this year and next year to address the high rate of maternal death and perinatal death.""Women are coming on a timely basis with complications, so we're able to assist them.

Many believe it’s a first step towards arming the Solomon Islands police with proper arms,” he said.“I’m just asking for more transparency. This should not be secret… in any democratic country we should have transparency if there is a policy shift.”Dr Anna Powles, from Massey University, also said the move to bring in replica arms clearly suggested the police force was planning to bring in real weapons from China in the future.""The purpose of training with replica weapons is to develop the skills necessary to safely operate the real versions — in this case, the QBZ-95 assault rifle — which suggests that the RSIPF is seeking these capabilities to strengthen its public order capabilities,” she said.Australia already offers some firearms training to Solomon Islands police, but Dr Powles said it was “unclear” how the new weapons would align with that existing program.The Police Commissioner’s statement suggested that Solomon Islands police wanted the weapons to help bolster training for officers being sent on UN peacekeeping missions overseas.  “Such commitments by our partners would also help us in contributing strategically to fortify our regional and international commitments such as the UN Peacekeeping Missions,” he said.“I would very much welcome any other bilateral partners who wish to come forward to modernise the RSIPF to do so.”Dr Powles said it was possible that RSIPF did want to expand its contribution to UN missions, perhaps by developing “a formed police unit which deploys with long arms.”“But, importantly, it also suggests that China would also supply and arm the RSIPF contingents,” she said.More broadly, the controversy has fuelled speculation and anger on social media in Solomon Islands, which is still grappling with the fallout of mass riots late last year.Australia sent in troops and police to restore order in Honiara in November when anti-government protests exploded into widespread looting and rioting.A smaller Australian contingent remains in the capital, along with police officers sent more recently from Papua New Guinea.Many of the November protesters came from the populous province of Malaita, where local politicians have renewed a push for independence in the wake of Solomon Islands’ decision to break with Taiwan and recognise China.The ABC has seen several social media posts showing people from Malaita speculating — without evidence — that the Solomon Islands government had imported real weapons from China in order to hunt down pro-independence leaders in the province. Violence exploded in Malaita last week when police raided a village in a failed attempt to arrest the Malaita for Democracy President Knoxly Atu, who they allege incited last year’s riots.Villagers said the police lobbed stun grenades into the community during the raid, accusing officers of injuring women and children.But Commissioner Mangau says police only used the stun grenades after the villagers “attacked them with dangerous weapons such as slings, spears, bows and arrows on their arrival”.Dr Powles said whatever the purpose of the replica weapons, the secrecy around the shipment had been very damaging in the charged political climate.""Bringing weapons, including replica weapons, into the country aboard a logging vessel is highly unusual and the lack of clarity and transparency is fuelling unease and disinformation in Solomon Islands,"" she said.","Australia, China, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-03-23T06:22:52+00:00

It's unfortunate that anyone starts to make judgements because they come from one particular country,"" Mr Beck told journalists.""It's unfortunate some of our close friends have opinions on that. All we can do is just note it.""Anna Powles from Massey University in New Zealand — who is an expert on the Pacific and security issues — said the controversy over the shipment also appeared to expose vulnerabilities in Solomon Islands' border arrangements.""Questions need to be asked why the Chinese weapons consignment destined for the Solomon Islands police entered the country on board a Chinese-Malaysian logging vessel [that] docked at a private, Chinese-owned wharf,"" Dr Powles said.""It begs the question of why the need for secrecy, and what else was brought in with the consignment?""She also said that bringing in large quantities of even fake weapons was ""potentially a very serious blunder by Chinese diplomats in Honiara"" in the current political climate.""The optics of weapons arriving under a veil of secrecy only months after serious riots and amidst a climate of insecurity shows very poor judgement,"" Dr Powles said.The Chinese Embassy in Honiara did not respond directly to questions about the shipment.But a representative in the embassy pointed the ABC to previous statements it has made defending the police cooperation program.In one of the statements, China's Ambassador to Solomon Islands Li Ming said that many criticisms of the initiative were ""Sinophobic"" and the police cooperation was ""open and transparent, guided strictly by principles of sovereignty and non-interference"".He also denied that the program would escalate political tensions in Solomon Islands or disrupt existing police cooperation programs.""It is up to the Solomon Islands government to decide how to utilise the assistance.

Mr Abbott laughed and said something similar had occurred at a Pacific Islands Forum meeting with Pacific nations the previous day in Papua New Guinea.""Time doesn't mean anything when ... you're about to have water lapping at your door,"" Dutton responded, eliciting more laughs from the PM... until Morrison pointed out that there was a boom microphone hovering above their heads — which of course famously had picked up the entire exchange.Dutton's comments — reflecting a spectacular disdain for the existential threat many Pacific nations feel from climate change — came to mind on Friday.On morning television, he dismissed suggestions that the revelation that Solomon Islands was negotiating a security deal with China — which might eventually lead to a Chinese naval base being established in the small nation — meant the government had ""dropped the ball"" in the Pacific.""We have a fantastic relationship with the Solomon Islands and we're there at the request of the government of the Solomon Islands at the moment,"" Dutton said. ""We have 50 people on the ground and they're going to stay there in the run-up to 2023. There's a lot more we can do for them."" He went on: ""As part of the Pacific family, it is obvious we want to work together and we want to resolve any issues within that family, within our region. And we would be concerned clearly about any military base being established and we would express that to the Solomon Islands' government."" Well, yes, such a fantastic relationship that Canberra only found out that Honiara had signed a policing agreement with Beijing — and was now working on a much more comprehensive arrangement that included the military — a couple of weeks ago.Let's just put what is happening in the Pacific at the moment into perspective. One of the strategic reasons given for why we want to now move to nuclear submarines, and spend billions of dollars doing it, is that they can be stationed a lot further ""forward"" in the South China Sea than is currently the case. That is, they can stay up near China for long stretches of time as a vital part of our forward defences. This is a really great strategy — as long as the Chinese navy hasn't already got a lot closer to Australia by establishing naval bases in, amongst other places, Solomon Islands (just over 3,000km away) or even potentially in PNG on the island of Daru (about 200km away over the Torres Strait), as noted in this column in December 2020.A new economic superpower in the region was always going to be hard to deal with, but perhaps if we were even slightly good at just being patronising, we might not be facing quite such an alarming development in what we patronisingly refer to our as backyard just now.Compared to the mega spend on submarines, our Pacific neighbours are supposed to be impressed by the government last year announcing an extra $500 million to a $3 billion regional infrastructure plan as a sign that Australia was ""a reliable and steady member of the Pacific family"".It is hard not to see that disdain for climate change — which had powerful ripple effects in the Pacific's attitude to Australia — as part of a pattern of our regional relationships being driven much too heavily by domestic politics in the past decade, instead of strategic interest.Dutton's remarks in 2015, of course, were made at the peak of the Coalition's refusal to do anything meaningful about climate change, and to wear this as a badge of honour in a political sense.And this week we have seen another issue that has been completely captured and defined by domestic politics finally start to be resolved.For almost a decade, there has been a deal in place which would have allowed some of those asylum seekers who arrived in Australia by boat to be resettled in New Zealand.But the Prime Minister and his colleagues have stubbornly refused to pursue it, publicly arguing such a deal would restart boat arrivals or be used as a back door for people wanting to enter Australia (that would be all 150 of them a year for the next three years).There was much focus at week's end on the ""secret deal"" independent senator Jacquie Lambie had done with the government , in which she agreed to support the repeal of the so-called Medevac legislation in order to get this agreement finally acted upon.But 450 people over three years leaves a lot of people in the horrific limbo Australia has created for them. The NZ deal might clear Nauru, and some of the people who are back on the mainland. But it won't of itself help the hundred-odd men stuck in Papua New Guinea. The fate of somewhere between 600 and 700 people remains uncertain.Whether the government's announcement this week is driven by a responsibility to honour a deal with Lambie, or by a wish to clear the slate when the government is under threat from independents in a range of seats about issues like this, is hard to tell.But a week or so out from the election campaign officially beginning, the government doesn't seem to have a lot left in its political ammunition cabinet. The Solomon Islands revelations are but another challenge to its claims of superior national security and defence management.Trying to decipher a clear fiscal strategy from Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's remarks about next week's budget is equally unhelpful politically.Already there is a sense that all the government has left, in a world where polls tell us the PM's reputation with voters is ... not in a good place, is to try to tear down the Opposition Leader's reputation.Scott Morrison took part in spending announcements around the country this week that amounted to a not insubstantial sum of around $8 billion.Yet he seemed to get as much coverage for commenting on Anthony Albanese's weight loss, or denying he has been at the Hillsong Church for 15 years, when there are pictures of him leading prayer next to its now disgraced leader Brian Houston at the Church's conference in 2019.It is going to be an ugly, personal election campaign.But if you think about it, the issues and edifices that have defined and constrained our politics for the past decade — ""debt and deficits"", asylum seekers, climate change — are all crumbling into dust just now. Not because of any great leadership but because events in the world are simply overtaking us — and the issues.They may be discussed sotto voce in the election campaign. But you may need a boom mic to pick them up.Laura Tingle is 7.30's chief political correspondent.Editor’s note, 28/03/22: An earlier version of this story referred to the Pacific Islands Forum by its former name, the South Pacific Forum.","Australia, Budget, Defence Industry, Federal Election, Federal Government, Federal Parliament, Government and Politics, Solomon Islands, ",2022-03-25T18:00:00+00:00

We knew it was happening, but we don't really know the process.""And understanding how mosquitoes behave could help tailor programs to better curb the spread of diseases, such as malaria, without over-relying on pesticides.For some, mozzies are a mere pest to swat at barbecues, but for billions of people, being bitten by an infected female mosquito can mean hospitalisation or death.Aedes aegypti mosquitoes can carry viruses such as dengue, zika and chikungunya, and nearly half of the world's population is at risk of malaria, caused by a parasite spread by infected Anapholes mosquitoes.Some regions are home to clouds of mosquitoes so dense they can literally choke animals to death.""At one point, I was doing postdoctoral studies in Galveston, Texas, and that's one area of the world where humans living there really depend on mosquito control,"" Professor Tripet said.""There, cattle can die of mosquito inhalation — their lungs get filled with mosquitoes, and they die of that. It's extreme.""Since the first modern insecticides were developed in the 1930s, people have smeared and sprayed them around — sometimes too liberally — to keep mosquitoes under control.For a pesticide to do damage to an adult mosquito, it must first penetrate its tough outer shell, or cuticle.Once inside the body, the chemical slots into receptors on their cells, like keys in locks, and disables the insect's nervous system.But in the arms race between mosquitoes and insecticides, the humble mozzie has evolved some crafty ways to avoid being killed off by chemicals.Some of these are physical and cellular changes, such as growing a thicker cuticle that's impervious to insecticides, changing the receptor ""lock"" the chemical latches onto, and more efficiently mopping up toxins.But there's also the lesser-studied ""behavioural resistance"", when mosquitoes change what they do, and where and when they do it, to dodge a pesticide's deadly effects.And this is what Professor Tripet and his colleagues at Keele University and the Vector Control Unit of University Sains Malaysia wanted to explore.The researchers investigated how mosquitoes behave after exposure to five commonly used pesticides: malathion, propoxur, deltamethrin, permethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin.Of the thousands of mosquito species out there, they chose two prolific disease-transmitters: A. aegypti, as well as Culex quinquefasciatus, which can spread diseases such as West Nile virus and a parasitic worm that can cause elephantiasis.Only female mosquitoes were used, because they're the blood-suckers, needing protein found in blood to develop their eggs.Professor Tripet and his crew first exposed female mosquitoes to a pesticide — enough to knock them out and even kill off a few, but not so much that they all died.When the surviving mosquitoes came to, they were placed in one end of a tunnel. At the other end was bait: a rat.Separating them was netting, with some holes poked in it, treated with the same pesticide the mosquitoes had been exposed to previously.Only 15 per cent of pre-exposed A. aegypti and 12 per cent of C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes flew through the pesticide-laden net to get at the rat.This was markedly different to cohorts of mosquitoes that had not been exposed to pesticides before the test.More than half of those (58 per cent and 54 per cent of A. aegypti and C. quinquefasciatus respectively) chose to flit through the net.In the end, mosquitoes who'd encountered the pesticide before were more than twice as likely to survive than their naive counterparts.In another set of experiments, the researchers gave mosquitoes a choice of two boxes in which to rest. One smelled slightly of pesticide, while the other contained hints of silicone oil or olive oil.Mosquitoes who'd been pre-exposed to the pesticide overwhelmingly chose the oil box, Professor Tripet said.""They just didn't want to rest in the compartment with the pesticide smell.""Overall, those who'd not had that pre-exposure experience were as likely to choose either box.James Cook University's Tanya Russell, who was not involved in the study, says the new research backs up what she and other medical entomologists have seen in the field for years.""I'm really quite happy to see papers like this starting to break down how this [behavioural change] could be occurring,"" she said.Dr Russell and colleagues tracked how malaria-carrying mosquitoes in Solomon Islands shifted their feeding habits to circumvent insecticides applied on mosquito nets and on walls inside houses.""But instead of taking blood meals from people during the night and inside houses when people are asleep, they started feeding on people outdoors and very early in the evening when they're cooking — the kitchen is often outdoors,"" Dr Russell said.It's not just a few mosquitoes that started dining earlier and al fresco, either. The practice spread through the entire local mosquito population.These sweeping changes in behaviour can happen quickly too.Take, for instance, the case of DDT, a chemical widely used to control malaria mosquitoes in the middle of last century.""They could see population-level differences in the behaviour of mosquitoes within 12 months,"" Dr Russell said.""It was very fast, very, very quick.""The new study showed some mosquitoes could learn from their own experience and change their behaviour accordingly.Could this be passed down to their offspring?""Of course, maybe there is an inherited component due to selection over time,"" Professor Tripet said.He speculated that mosquitoes in West Africa — ""in areas where there is resistance to absolutely every pesticide you throw at them"" — could have behavioural resistance written in their genes.""So they never go inside, and they don't need to learn it — they now have this innate behaviour.""So mosquitoes can learn to stay away from insecticide-treated bed nets. That's a good thing, right?It is — to an extent, Professor Tripet said.""But if you look at why [insecticide-treated] bed nets were designed, they're really designed to have a human baiting the mosquitoes into touching the net and killing the mosquito.""Therefore, that leads to a decrease in the population size of the mosquitoes, and that feeds into a decrease in disease transmission.""If manufacturers added a substance to a pesticide that mosquitoes were drawn to, and exposure to a pesticide wasn't a completely negative experience, they might not be as easily conditioned to avoid it should they survive, he added.Professor Tripet is also keen to see more studies being conducted that expose mosquitoes to one pesticide and test them on another, or examine the behaviour of other mosquito species — particularly Anopheles species, which transmit malaria.This study highlights the importance of mosquito surveillance in the tropics and sub-tropics, Dr Russell said — not only looking out for physiological variations, but behavioural ones too.And there are tools and techniques that help keep a lid on mosquito populations that don't depend on the behaviour of the adult females.For instance, killing mosquitoes during their larval stage, while they're still wriggling around in water.Some mosquito species, including A. aegypti, prefer to lay eggs in small water containers, so cleaning up plant pot bases and the like can help control local populations too.Unfortunately, there's no one-size-fits-all fix, Dr Russell said.""It's really just a matter of understanding your target mosquitoes and their behaviours, and then building up those effective control products, and tailoring programs for each area.""","Animal Behaviour, Australia, Dengue Fever, Disease Outbreak, Entomology, Environmental Management, Invertebrates, Invertebrates - Insects and Arachnids, Malaria, Malaysia, Ross River Fever, Science and Technology, Solomon Islands, United Kingdom, ",2022-02-17T18:30:00+00:00

It is now represented by a consulate there, with an embassy in the Papua New Guinea capital of Port Moresby.In 2019 Mr Sogavare's government decided to formally cease diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, a move that angered many opposition supporters in Solomon Islands.","Australia, Defence Forces, Defence and National Security, Federal Government, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Solomon Islands, ",2022-02-23T14:41:49+00:00

Rioters set fire to buildings and looted stores.Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare survived a no-confidence vote the following month, telling politicians in a fiery 90-minute speech that he'd done nothing wrong and would not bow down to ""the forces of evil"" or to ""Taiwan's agents"".The US previously operated an embassy in the Solomons for five years before closing it in 1993.Since then, US diplomats from neighbouring Papua New Guinea have been accredited to the Solomons, which has a US consular agency.The embassy announcement fits with a new Biden administration strategy for the Indo-Pacific that emphasises building partnerships with allies in the region as a way to counter China's growing influence and ambitions.In its notification to Congress, the State Department said China had been ""utilising a familiar pattern of extravagant promises, prospective costly infrastructure loans, and potentially dangerous debt levels,"" when engaging with political and business leaders from Solomon Islands.""The United States has a strategic interest in enhancing our political, economic, and commercial relationship with Solomon Islands, the largest Pacific Island nation without a US Embassy,"" the State Department wrote.The State Department said it didn't expect to build a new embassy immediately but would at first lease space at an initial set-up cost of $US12.4 million ($17.3 million).The embassy would be located in the capital, Honiara, and would start small, with two US employees and about five local staff.The State Department said the Peace Corps was planning to reopen an office in Solomon Islands and have its volunteers serve there, and that several US agencies were establishing government positions with portfolios in the Solomons.""The department needs to be part of this increased US presence, rather than remaining a remote player,"" it wrote.Mr Blinken arrived in Fiji after visiting Melbourne where he had a meeting with his counterparts from Australia, India and Japan.The four nations form the Quad, a bloc of Indo-Pacific democracies that was created to counter China's regional influence.In Fiji, Mr Blinken plans to meet with Pacific Island leaders to discuss the climate crisis, the coronavirus pandemic and disaster assistance.It was the first visit by a US secretary of state to Fiji since 1985.ABC/AP","Australia, China, Fiji, Pacific, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2022-02-12T05:09:03+00:00

But we managed,"" she said.Living in PNG's highlands, Ms Kanamon said she often felt judged by her inability to breastfeed.""People would give me that look of disappointment when I was feeding my child with a bottle instead of breastmilk,"" she said.""Not a lot of us understand the different, various reasons why working mums can't breastfeed.""PNG news director Genesis Ketan wanted to exclusively breastfeed her four children, including twins, but managing work and nursing proved difficult.Ms Ketan gave birth to her daughter in 2017 but it coincided with the country's elections, so she returned to work three weeks later.Missing out on crucial bonding time with her baby had lasting impacts.""I had to exclusively bottle-feed after that and I've noticed she has formed a closer relationship to her babysitter and her father than to me,"" she said.""You want that bond that comes from breastfeeding your baby.""PNG is one of the last countries in the world to guarantee paid maternity leave.Working mothers are entitled to six weeks of maternity leave, unpaid — for it to be paid, they must convert sick leave and recreation leave into maternity leave. While Ms Ketan felt supported by her employer, who granted her leave to breastfeed her premature twin babies, she said she still faced barriers. ""It's easier if you have a vehicle so you can travel home to breastfeed during the lunchtime, or express pump milk and fill up the bottles,"" she said.""But I didn't have a car at the time, so I couldn't go home and come back to work.""Employers need to make paid time for this, or even if it is on our lunchbreak, then our employer needs to provide transport to and from our home.""If everything at home is fine and our babies are fully fed, satisfied and happy, then we're happy workers and we're able to be more productive at the end of the day.""Physician and mother Mangu Kendino's breastfeeding experience with her seven-month-old daughter has been different to Ms Kanamon and Ms Ketan's. Under PNG's Public Services Act, female public servants are entitled to two hours of paid breastfeeding leave per day for six months. But utilising it becomes a matter of being able to ""potentially accommodate for that during the work schedule,"" Dr Kanamon said.""I wake up in the morning, she wakes up after me, I breastfeed her, then I run off to work,"" she said.""It's then a cycle throughout the day when I'm returning at 10am, 12pm, 2pm.""Dr Kendino said she is ""in awe"" of those who still accommodate for feeds, without financial support from their employer.""If you are not exclusively breastfeeding within the six-month period, don't feel you are inferior in any way,"" she said.Frances Vulivuli, a health and nutrition specialist with UNICEF in Fiji, said the ""worrisome"" decline in breastfeeding rates were being seen in Samoa and countries not signed up to the World Health Assembly code to promote breastfeeding.Of the 14 Pacific Island countries supported by UNICEF Pacific, only two have taken regulatory action in line with the code — Fiji and Palau.""In Samoa, the exclusive breastfeeding dropped from 70.3 per cent in 2014 to 51.7 per cent in 2019,"" she said.""Early initiation within the first hour fell from 81.4 per cent in 2014 to 53 per cent in 2019.Dr Vulivuli said ""urgent action"" must be taken to address this decline across the Pacific.""Babies who are exclusively breastfed are 14 times less likely to die in the first six months than babies who are not breastfed,"" she said.""Breastmilk saves children's lives as it provides antibodies that give babies a healthy boost and protect them against many childhood illnesses.""","Breastfeeding, Children, Fiji, Health, Healthcare Facilities, Infant Health, Marshall Islands, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Parenting, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Work, ",2022-02-26T17:58:56+00:00
174,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-25/draft-security-agreement-china-solomon-islands-a-wake-up-call/100940598,"The draft security agreement between China and Solomon Islands circulating on social media raises important questions about how the Australian government and national security community understand power dynamics in the Pacific Islands.In Australian debates, the term “influence” is often used to characterise the assumed consequences of China's increasingly visible presence in the Pacific.There’s an assumption China generates influence primarily from its economic statecraft. This includes its concessional loans, aid and investment by state-owned enterprises (which partly manifests in Beijing’s involvement of Pacific Islands in its Belt and Road Initiative).On its face, the leaked draft seemingly proves Chinese spending “bought” enough influence to get the Solomon Islands government to consider this agreement. But such an interpretation misses two key issues.First, the draft agreement is primarily about Solomon Islands domestic politics — not just geopolitics. As explained by Dr Tarcisius Kabutaulaka after the November 2021 riots in Honiara, geopolitical considerations intersect with, and can be used to, advance longstanding domestic issues.These include uneven and unequal development, frustrated decentralisation and unresolved grievances arising from prior conflicts.Power in the Pacific is complex. It is not just politicians in the national government who matter in domestic and foreign policy-making.Take, for example, the activism of Malaita provincial governor Derek Suidani, who pursued relations with Taiwan after Solomon Islands switched diplomatic recognition to China in 2019. This highlights the important role sub-national actors can play in both the domestic and foreign policy arenas.Neither Solomon Islanders (nor other Pacific peoples) are ""passive dupes"" to Chinese influence or unaware of geopolitical challenges — and opportunities. Some do, however, face resource and constitutional constraints when resisting influence attempts.The second key issue is that Australia’s current policy settings are not working — if their success is measured by advancing Australia’s strategic interests.Australia is by far the Pacific’s largest aid donor and has been on a spending spree under its ""Pacific Step-up"" initiative. Australia spent billions leading the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), as well as significant bilateral programs to the country. Yet Australia has not been able to head off Honiara considering the security agreement with China.Perhaps Canberra has not sought to influence Solomon Islands on this matter. But given Australia’s longstanding anxieties about potentially hostile powers establishing a presence in the region, this is unlikely.Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews has already commented in response to the leaked draft that: ""This is our neighbourhood and we are very concerned of any activity that is taking place in the Pacific Islands.""The rumours (subsequently denied) that China was in talks to establish a military base in Vanuatu, and China's attempt to lease Tulagi Island in Solomon Islands had already intensified Australia’s anxieties. Such concerns partly motivated the government’s investment in the Pacific Step-up.The terms of the draft security agreement should make Australia anxious. It goes significantly beyond the bilateral security treaty between Solomon Islands and Australia.Article 1 provides that Solomon Islands may request China to “send police, police, military personnel and other law enforcement and armed forces to Solomon Islands” in circumstances ranging from maintaining social order to unspecified “other tasks agreed upon by the Parties”.Even more concerningly for Solomon Islands’ sovereignty, Article 1 also provides that:""Relevant forces of China can be used to protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands.""It remains unclear what authority the Solomon Islands government would maintain once it consents to Beijing’s deployment of “relevant forces” to protect Chinese nationals.Article 4 is equally vague. It states specific details regarding Chinese missions, including “jurisdiction, privilege and immunity [...] shall be negotiated separately”.The agreement also raises questions about the transparency of agreements Beijing makes and their consequences for democracy in its partner states. According to Article 5: ""Without the written consent of the other party, neither party shall disclose the cooperation information to a third party.""This implies the Solomon Islands government is legally bound not to inform its own people and their democratically elected representatives about activities under the agreement without Chinese approval.The version circulating on social media may prove to be an early draft. Its leak is likely a bargaining tactic aimed at pursuing multiple agendas with multiple actors — including Australia.Australian High Commissioner Lachlan Strahan met yesterday with Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare and announced Australia will extend its assistance force until December 2023. It will build a national radio network, construct a second patrol boat outpost, and provide SI$130 million ($21.5 million) in budget support. While the timing was likely coincidental, it highlights an emerging dynamic in Australia’s Pacific policy: playing whack-a-mole by seeking to directly counter Chinese moves through economic statecraft.Think of Telstra’s recent purchase of  Digicel Pacific, headquartered in PNG — a move seen by some analysts as really an attempt to shut China out of the Pacific.That China has been able to persuade Solomon Islands to consider an intrusive security agreement raises questions about our understanding of how power and influence are exercised in the Pacific.If influence is taken to result in concrete behavioural changes (such as entering into a bilateral security agreement), and if Australia is going to ""compete"" with China on spending, you'd need to ask, for example: how much “influence” does an infrastructure project buy? This understanding of power, however, is insufficient. Instead, a more nuanced approach is required.Influence is exercised not only by national governments, but also by a variety of non-state actors, including sub-national and community groups. And targets of influence-seekers can exercise their agency. See, for example, how various actors in Solomon Islands are leveraging Australia, China and Taiwan’s overtures to the country.We must also consider how power affects the political norms and values guiding governing elites and non-state actors, potentially reshaping their identities and interests.The draft security agreement may come to nothing — but it should provide a wake-up call to Australia and its partners.Old assumptions about how power and influence are exercised in the Pacific need urgent re-examination — as does our assumption that explicitly ""competing"" with China advances either our interests or those of the Pacific.Joanne Wallis is a Professor of International Security and Czeslaw Tubilewicz is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Adelaide.

We're concerned that that isn't the case in this situation. Obviously it's just developing today, so we're trying to get more detail around it. But it is a concerning development.""The ABC has verified the document is genuine. It is believed to have been recently drawn up but not yet formally signed by both governments, although the ABC has not yet confirmed this.It is also unclear if this draft version of the document will be the one taken to Solomon Islands' cabinet.It was first published online by an adviser to the Malaita Provincial Government Premier Daniel Suidani, who has been a fierce critic of Solomon Islands' decision to break diplomatic ties with Taiwan and who has been pressing for independence for his province.Australian officials are already deeply uneasy about growing security cooperation between China and Solomon Islands.On Thursday evening, Australia's top diplomat to Solomon Islands, Lachlan Strahan, announced the Solomons International Assistance Force would remain in the country until the end of next year, and more monetary aid would be directed to the small nation. ""Following a meeting with PM Sogavare, delighted to confirm Australia will extend the Solomons International Assistance force until December 2023, build a radio network across Solomon Islands, construct a second patrol boat outpost on the eastern border and provide $130 million (SBD) in budget support,"" the High Commissioner tweeted.The diplomat did not state whether he had discussed concerns over the draft ""Framework Agreement"" with China during his meeting with the Prime Minister. A contingent of Chinese police officers was recently deployed to Solomon Islands to help train local authorities trying to maintain law and order following last year's deadly anti-government riots.There has also been anxiety in Solomon Islands about a recent shipment of ""replica rifles"" brought in by the Chinese embassy for that training program.However, the prospect of a possible Chinese military presence in Solomon Islands, right on Australia's doorstop, will raise far deeper alarm in Canberra.Australia has long been the main security provider to Solomon Islands and is determined to retain its pre-eminence in that role.In November, the federal government deployed federal police and ADF personnel to Honiara to restore calm following a request for support from Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare.Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews said the Australian government would view any expansion of Chinese military activity in the Pacific as concerning.""We will continue to support the Solomon Islands. We know the difficult circumstances that they are in,"" Ms Andrews said.""That is our backyard. This is our neighbourhood and we are very concerned of any activity that is taking place in the Pacific Islands.""Our Pacific Island friends know that we are there to support them.""Solomon Islands Opposition MP Peter Kenilorea Jr has told the ABC he had heard late last year that a security agreement with China was being discussed.""For me, the writing has been on the wall since the switch [from Taiwan] in 2019,"" Mr Kenilorea told the ABC.""Like many Solomon Islanders, I am deeply concerned with these developments on our shores. This has serious security implications for the Pacific Islands region, including Australia.""A DFAT spokesperson said the successful response by the Pacific family to help restore calm in the country following unrest in Honiara showed Pacific neighbours were best placed to respond to ""situations affecting Pacific regional security"".""The Pacific family is able to provide security assistance without the need for external support and stand ready to assist further if needed,"" they said. ""Australia's cooperation with our Pacific Family is focused on the economic prosperity, security and development of our region.

Islands is for the people of the Solomon Islands under their constitution, under their normal processes to resolve any issues they have,"" Mr Morrison said on Sunday.""We are just simply there as a good family member to try and provide a stable and safe environment for the issues that are there in the Solomon Islands to be peacefully worked.""Petrol stations, shops and other businesses began to reopen on Saturday, with Honiara residents flocking to buy basic provisions as the violence ebbed.Mr Morrison said he was being updated regularly and he had been talking with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern about getting some assistance.""They (New Zealand) have a lot of expertise working within our Pacific family of nations,"" he said.Mr Morrison also thanked the governments of Papua New Guinea, Fiji and New Zealand for supporting the response.""At this point, although things are very unstable at this point, there are no areas to our knowledge where there's been a loss of control,"" Mr Morrison said.What began as a small protest on Wednesday quickly descended into a violent free-for-all, with impoverished Honiara residents joining anti-government protesters to rampage through the shattered glass and burnt-out remains of businesses for things to eat or sell.For three straight days, angry mobs cut through the usually sleepy seaside capital, demanding the removal of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare.Two years of pandemic-induced closed borders have left the already ravaged Solomon Islands economy in tatters, deepening widespread joblessness and poverty among the population of around 800,000.An early estimate of the cost, released by the Central Bank of Solomon Islands, said 56 buildings in the capital had been burnt and looted, with many businesses facing over a year-long recovery.While the loss to the economy was expected to be at least $39.3 million, with the bank's governor warning that the nation's accounts — already struggling to recover from the COVID pandemic — had been further weakened by the riots.A more thorough estimate of the damage would be released in the coming days, he added.Local police said a forensic team was working to identify the charred remains of three bodies found in a shop in the city's burnt-out Chinatown district.Heavily armed police were a visible presence on nearby streets as locals began clean up operations and limited bus services resumed.A night-time curfew and the presence of roughly 150 foreign peacekeepers from Australia and Papua New Guinea appeared to have helped cool tensions.But the scale of the recovery was coming into sharp focus, even as the city remained on edge.Many Solomon Islanders believe their government is corrupt and beholden to Beijing and other foreign interests.""Most people are barely getting one meal a day, there are no tourists and very little economic stimulus,"" Douglas Kelson, chief officer at St John Ambulance Service, told the AFP news wire.""People do things they normally wouldn't when they are hungry.""Protesters channelled their anger directly at Mr Sogavare and his government, with mobs attempting to torch parliament and the prime minister's private residence as police fired tear gas and warning shots.More than 100 people have been arrested for riot-related activity, Solomon Islands police said on Saturday as they tried to restore order.""No one is above the law,"" said Commissioner Mostyn Mangau, urging residents to ""respect each other, as well as our visiting friends from abroad"".As tensions escalated, Mr Sogavare had begged neighbours for urgent help.In a letter obtained by the AFP news wire, the prime minister told his Papua New Guinea counterpart James Marape that ""certain elements"" had ""attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government"" and called for peacekeepers to be sent for a ""period of three to four weeks"".In an address to the nation, Mr Sogavare told citizens the Solomons had been ""brought to its knees"" by the rioting but vowed to resist calls for his resignation.But the political situation remained fraught.Opposition leaders on Saturday called for a vote of no confidence in Mr Sogavare's leadership.They may not yet have enough votes to pass the motion and remove Mr Sogavare from office, but the move could produce another flashpoint.The pro-Beijing leader claimed foreign powers opposed to his 2019 decision to switch the Solomons' diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China were behind the disturbances.But others pointed to inter-island tensions and widespread joblessness among the country's population – 40 per cent of whom are under 14 years of age.The archipelago nation has for decades endured ethnic and political tensions.Residents of Malaita Province have long complained that their island is neglected by the central government, and divisions intensified when Mr Sogavare recognised Beijing.The Malaita Province, the most populous island of the archipelago, has maintained connections with Taipei in defiance of the central government.China's government on Friday condemned the violence and vowed to ""safeguard the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and institutions"".ABC/AFP","COVID-19, Defence Forces, Demonstrations, Epidemics and Pandemics, Foreign Affairs, Pacific, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2021-11-28T02:40:10+00:00

And we couldn't go to Malaita, it's unsafe for my husband.""It was so unsafe, it was so scary.""So that's why we fled the country and we came over to Australia.""Ms Teobasi Tadokata recalls militia coming to her house, trying to harm her husband.""They were actually trying to hurt him and we went into hiding for a few days until we got a visa and we could get out of the country,"" she says.Ms Teobasi Tadokata watched on through the news and social media as riots broke out in Honiara last Wednesday, with protesters mostly of Malaita origin calling for Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare to resign.At least three people have died — found in a burnt-out building in Honiara's Chinatown — and more than 100 have been arrested for alleged looting and arson.""It just breaks your heart, like seeing everything now people are posting,"" she says.""It's really, really emotional at the moment.""Your heart aches and really, you feel very helpless.""While far from home, she is in touch with friends and family members based on Honiara who have fallen victim to recent rioting.""One of my uncles ... his whole shop has been burned down,"" she says.""Now I know that all my aunties and cousins and uncles, that's their income, that's the family money that comes in.""So it's gone like that.

192,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-21/lowy-institute-pacific-vaccination-covid-19-png/100634994,"New research suggests that some Melanesian nations may take years to achieve even basic COVID-19 vaccination coverage, hampering their economic recovery and raising the risk of new variants emerging close to Australia's shores.By contrast, Fiji and smaller Pacific Island nations in Polynesia and Micronesia have already achieved or are close to reaching key vaccination benchmarks, making it much easier for them to re-open to the outside world. The Lowy Institute has crunched health and population data to project when Pacific Island nations are likely to have vaccinated enough people to protect their populations from the worst impacts of COVID-19. Lowy Institute research fellow Alexandre Dayant said the analysis ""revealed a region divided"", with the Melanesian nations of Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands lagging well behind the rest. Papua New Guinea's position is particularly dire.The country has been hit hard by the delta strain of COVID-19 but fewer than 4 per cent of eligible adults are currently vaccinated, and the Lowy Institute projects only 16 per cent of people will be vaccinated by December next year. Its long-term projection is even more pessimistic: Lowy predicts only a third of PNG's adult population will be fully vaccinated by April 2026, more than four years from now.The vaccine rollout in Vanuatu and Solomon Islands has been significantly faster, and both nations have managed to protect their citizens and stop COVID-19 from spreading through the community by shutting their borders.However, both countries are still making much slower progress than other Pacific nations.The Lowy Institute research predicts that the Solomon Islands will have vaccinated 66 per cent of its eligible adults by December next year, below the thresholds needed to curb the impact of COVID-19. And the Lowy Institute predicts Vanuatu will only have vaccinated 56 per cent of eligible adults by the end of next year, which means it will remain vulnerable to a catastrophic outbreak and will likely have to keep its borders shut for some time.Lowy's Mr Dayant said all three nations — and, particularly, Papua New Guinea — were struggling with vaccine hesitancy and outright resistance. ""The issue in these countries is a combination of a limited number of healthcare workers, weak government capacity, large rural populations and misinformation,"" Mr Dayant said.""In a region where social media has become the primary conduit for news consumption, conspiracy and conjecture about the vaccine have spread faster than the disease itself.""This has fed into an already-low level of trust in formal and public institutions."" Australia has already poured substantial resources into the vaccine rollout in Papua New Guinea, including programs designed to encourage vaccination and fight misinformation. However, Mr Dayant said, the grim forecast for PNG showed Australia and other development partners in the country needed to expand counter-misinformation campaigns.""You could help design more targeted and context-specific campaigns across a range of platforms to convey the message [that] the vaccine is safe,"" he said. He also urged Australia to expand its efforts to bolster health systems in Melanesia in order to help drive up the vaccination rate. The Lowy Institute's forecasts for Melanesia contrast sharply with its projections and assessments of the vaccine rollout in other parts of the Pacific. Fiji was battered by an outbreak of the Delta variant of Covid-19 this year but has now vaccinated more than 90 per cent of adults — largely using doses donated by Australia — which has dramatically driven down the number of cases and admissions to hospital. Mr Dayant said Fiji's performance stood out as a ""turnaround success"" in the region, giving the Government credit for an effective vaccination rollout, driven by both incentives and controversial vaccine mandates for Fijian workers. Palau and Nauru were also able to quickly vaccinate almost their entire populations, reaching key vaccine milestones well ahead of Australia.The Lowy Institute predicts that other Micronesian nations are likely to reach the same level of protection in the first half of next year, often using doses provided by the United States. Larger Polynesian nations are making good progress towards full vaccination as well, with the Lowy Institute projecting Samoa will achieve widespread coverage next month, and Tonga hitting the same benchmark in January next year.The Lowy Institute research also confirmed that Australia was, by far, the largest donor of COVID-19 vaccines to the region. Australia's federal government has promised to share up to 15 million domestically manufactured vaccines with Pacific Island countries and Timor Leste as part of a broader commitment to provide 60 million doses to the wider region. The most recent federal government data shows that Australia has, so far, sent more than one million vaccines to Fiji, as well as more than 200,000 vaccines to both Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.Vanuatu has received 100,000 doses from Australia, while Samoa has taken 50,000 doses and Tonga has taken 19,000.The Lowy Institute said that the next-largest commitment to the Pacific region was from the COVAX Facility, which has committed 4.5 million doses, followed by New Zealand, which has promised 520,000 doses, and then China and the United States. Mr Dayant said that, when COVID-19 broke out, there were fears that Pacific Island nations would ""fall towards the back of the global queue"" for vaccines, but that scenario was averted thanks to the vaccine diplomacy of Australia and other donors.","Australia, COVID-19, Epidemics and Pandemics, Infectious Diseases (Other), Nauru, Pacific, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Vaccines and Immunity, World

have swallowed parts of her country's landscape. When the teen was younger, she would visit the islands of Choiseul province where her father, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, grew up.""He would tell wonderful stories, like he and his brothers playing on the sandy beaches of Nuatabu and having to wake up very early in the morning to go attend church gatherings at the end of the village,"" Shannon says.""The sad thing is that I never get to see the whole island of Nuatabu, which my father grew up in. ""The middle part of the island of Nuatabu is now fully covered with sea, leaving the island with two … separate islands.""She fears what the archipelago's landscape will look like in years to come and is acutely aware of the threat climate changes poses to her home.""As a teenager, this issue of climate change is very personal for me, since I myself have a long life to live,"" Shannon says.""And, by looking at how the climate patterns are changing, and how climate change has affected my family [and] village community, I don't actually know what my future would be like, and … what the survival of my future would be.""Shannon, like many children and young people in the Pacific, is paying close attention to the developments and outcomes of the COP26 conference currently taking place in Glasgow. The future for the region — according to modelling from Save the Children's Born into The Climate Crisis report — looks grim, with children in Australia and the Pacific predicted to experience up to 10 times more extreme weather events than their ancestors. Worldwide, that figure jumps to 24 times as many climate-induced extreme weather events, for children born in 2020.The report says a baby born last year in Papua New Guinea will face 10 times the heat waves and double the risk of fires than were experienced by their elders. Meanwhile, children in Vanuatu are predicted to face nearly three times as many droughts.It is not a future that Tanya Watsivi McGarry*, 9, who lives in Vanuatu, is willing to accept.""No, I wouldn't want to grow up in a world like that where there was more climate change, where there were storms, because I would not feel like that was right,"" Tanya says.Even at nine years of age, Tanya is old enough to remember bunkering down when Cyclone Pam tore through her home six years ago. ""We were all squashed up in the bathroom,"" Tanya says, recalling the category five cyclone.""We could hear the glass shattering and the water came up."" She rememberers feeling ""very scared"", worried about the trees that surrounded her home. Just last year, her home island of Pentecost was devastated by Cyclone Harold, tearing infrastructure apart and decimating crops and resources. ""It was terrible,"" Tanya says. ""All the fruits, the vegetables, the island cabbage, all of that was destroyed.""Then it couldn't grow anymore."" Growing up in the shadow of climate change, the young girl recognises the role foreign countries will play in the region's future.""There [are] people out there who are trying to do their best and then there [are] people out there who are not trying to do their best,"" she says.Tanya's sentiments reflect those of Pacific leaders, who have criticised Australia for not having ambitious enough emissions reduction targets.Late last month, Australia committed to a target to reach net zero by 2050.Earlier this week, Pacific Island leaders pressed Prime Minster Scott Morrison to make sharper cuts to Australia's emissions this decade.During his speech to world leaders, Mr Morrison said Australia would increase its climate finance commitment to its Pacific and South-East Asian neighbours by $500 million over the next five years, to reach a total of $2 billion. In Fiji, Aiyanna Nacewa, 8, and her classmates are learning what to do in the event of a cyclone. ""We learn [if] one big storm hits, we should board up, save our electricity and save our water and food and close up the windows and doors,"" Aiyanna says.While the lessons help students understand how to prepare for natural disasters, they do little to ease the fear children like Aiyanna have internalised about natural disasters and climate change. ""When a first cyclone hit with thunder and lightning, I looked outside the window and I was scared because my thoughts were that lightning could hit our house and, and that's when it could make a hole through the roof.""Shannon has witnessed communities searching for food, water and shelter after cyclones that have flattened villages in the Solomon Islands.""This country is very vulnerable to natural disasters, houses, villages and even lives were lost due to natural disasters,"" Shannon says.""So, to what it means to grow up with cyclones and extreme weather, [it] basically means to grow up with fear, fear of dying, fear of losing my own home, and also fear of trying to survive.""I understand that this is not an easy issue that world leaders could address overnight. ""But I would want the world leaders to please sympathise with us Pacific Island countries, and see how my own people are struggling to survive due to climate change. ""As a teenager, I want to call on world leaders to try and change things around my family's life, my own life, my future is at stake.""*Tanya Watsivi McGarry is the daughter of freelance

194,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-28/solomon-islands-unrest-china-us-post-american-world/100652772,"We hear a lot about the ""post-American world"" but we are now also getting a glimpse of ""Pax Sinica"". The unrest in the Solomon Islands shows us what happens when the balance of power shifts and security and order can no longer be guaranteed.Images of burning buildings and people looting is a wake-up call. Chinese businesses are being targeted as anger rises against Beijing's increasing influence in the country.The Solomon Islands has switched its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to mainland China. The Pacific Islands, more generally, is in the front line of Xi Jinping's vision of the China Dream: China as the unrivalled regional power.Now Australia has been dragged in, sending in police and troops to help restore order.It reminds us how volatile our region is and how what happens in the broader Indo-Pacific will define global security in the 21st century.More than 20 years ago, international affairs expert Charles Kupchan warned we needed to prepare for the end of Pax Americana. He said history provided sobering lessons of what happens when old certainties are upended.Back then, China was still a long way from rivalling the US, and Kupchan was less focused on the Beijing threat than America's willingness and capacity to helm a global order. He said nations will have to adapt; the key challenge would be ""weaning Europe and East Asia off their excessive dependence on the current hegemon"".What's happened since? The September 11 terrorist attacks triggered endless wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the global financial crisis tipped much of the world and America into deep recession, and the US has become increasingly and bitterly divided.Today — after retreat from Afghanistan, the disruption and often violent upheaval that marked the Trump presidency — America appears a tired and limited power. Joe Biden is trying to reassure allies that America is back, but the US cannot project its power in ways it once could.And all the while China has continued to rise. It is already the world's biggest engine of economic growth and will soon surpass America as the world's largest economy.Xi Jinping is seizing the moment to crack down hard at home, crushing dissent while expanding China's interest abroad. He has shown that he will intimidate nations and use trade as both a lure and a weapon.What does a Pax Sinica look like? Well, certainly no commitment to universal standards of human rights. China does not seek alliances so much as transactions. Hence projects like the massive Belt and Road Initiative and infrastructure and investment push spanning 70 countries that by 2040 is projected to boost global GDP by seven trillion dollars a year.China promises the world what it promises its own people: we can make you rich, we don't care to make you free.The Beijing consensus would be less about interfering with other countries' internal issues than influencing outcomes that suit China. Put simply: nations can do what they like — suppress freedom, undermine democracy — so long as Beijing gets its way.Already there are those accommodating this new world order. Singaporean former diplomat and writer Kishore Mahbubani has asked whether China has already won. He argues it ""is perfectly natural"" for China to seek greater recognition and respect. Perhaps so.Mahbubani says the US needs to learn to share power with China. But surely we have to ask at what cost? Where does the West draw the line?Taiwan is a flashpoint. There is increasing talk of war in Beijing, Canberra and Washington. Australian shadow foreign minister, Penny Wong, has accused Defence Minister, Peter Dutton, of dangerously talking up conflict.But surely when Xi Jinping says he reserves the right to seize Taiwan by force and escalates military exercises over the island, then the prospect of war can't be ignored.This week Australian China watcher and defence analyst, Hugh White, said we are in ""an acute strategic crisis"". He said we have to ask what the cost of war would be. If the world wants to maintain a global order, White argued, then war is not the answer.As he warned: ""Once war starts that order would probably be utterly destroyed."" But his answer is not to confront China. White said while our values matter and we might prefer to live under a US-led order we have to ask if ""we are willing to go to war with China over it?""That's where we are: a battle for the global order, the prospect of war and whether democracy is even worth fighting for.Australia is at the crosshairs of this big shift. It is frozen out by Beijing which is also making a big power play in Australia's own backyard the Pacific Islands.That's why the Solomon Islands matters.This is a big battleground. Combined, the South Pacific spans 13 million people and more than a dozen nations. It is one of the fastest growing regions in the world and faces existential crises like the impact of climate change.Since the end of World War II, the region has taken American power for granted. The US has underwritten stability in the region. No longer.China has surpassed Australia in terms of two-way trade with Pacific Island nations. In the Solomon Islands two-way trade with China now makes up almost half of the island nation's total trade.China has increased its aid to the region. It is building infrastructure and there has been a strong speculation about China's ambitions to develop military bases.The Brookings Institution has assessed China's growing influence and says ""it is certainly contributing to entrenching systems of corruption and patronage"". It warns that ""the opportunity, if it ever existed, to keep China out of the region has long passed.""                       It says this requires ""consistent resolve"" from the West. Australia is crucial. It is still the biggest donor and has the greatest diplomatic reach. Brookings says it is a question of resources versus resolve. China has the resources – the riches to tempt and influence nations. Does the West have the resolve?That's what Australia's presence in the Solomon Islands is about: responding to the request of a friend and showing its resolve to not surrender the region.Stan Grant presents China Tonight on Monday at 9.35pm on ABC TV, Tuesday at 8pm on  ABC News Channel and on iview.","Australia, China, Foreign Affairs, Solomon Islands, Unrest, Conflict and War, World Politics, ",2021-11-27T18:00:00+00:00

We would have expected a lot more.""However, the Solomon Islands' lead climate negotiator, Chanel Iroi, was more diplomatic, welcoming Australia's announcement.But, he said, there was still room for improvement.""I want to encourage Australia to meet the necessary steps … to ensure they continue to take the ambitious actions … because our obligation and ultimate aim is for the global goal … to ensure the 1.5C [maximum rise in temperatures] is achieved,"" he said.","Australia, Climate Change, Environment, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Kiribati, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Solomon Islands, ",2021-10-28T04:59:08+00:00

parliament, Chinese businesses and other buildings in the Pacific nation's capital, Honiara.Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Thursday afternoon that 23 Australian Federal Police officers and 43 Australian Defence Force personnel will be deployed to Solomon Islands to assist with ""riot control"".""Our presence will seek to calm the situation in the Solomon Islands,"" Mr Morrison said.Mr Morrison and Foreign Minister Marise Payne emphasised that Australia was not becoming involved in the internal affairs of Solomon Islands, but rather helping to restore stability.Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Zed Seselja, said Australia was committed to ""the security and the stability of the Pacific"".On Wednesday police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse large crowds demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare. Mr Sogavare announced a 36-hour lockdown of Honiara after Wednesday's violent protests, which saw buildings including a police station and a leaf hut next to Parliament House set on fire.Fresh protests have broken out in the capital on Thursday, with smoke seen from Honiara's Chinatown district.What started as a peaceful protest by people primarily from the Malaita Province turned violent on Wednesday as a crowd of about 1,000 people grew agitated.Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd, while buildings were stoned and others went up in flames.Mr Sogavare said it was a ""sad and unfortunate event aimed at bringing a democratically-elected government down"".So, what has sparked the civil unrest and what do China and Taiwan have to do with it?At the centre of a deepening rift between the central government and Malaita Province — the most populous island in the Solomon Islands archipelago —  is, somewhat surprisingly, foreign policy.Solomon Islands had previously been among only a handful of countries with diplomatic ties to Taipei rather than Beijing — a significant proportion of which are in the South Pacific.But in September 2019, Mr Sogavare established formal diplomatic ties with China.The ABC reported at the time that some $US500 million ($730 million) worth of financial aid had been promised by Beijing to the Solomons — one of the Pacific's poorest nations — in exchange for the move.This led to Taiwan terminating its diplomatic relations with Solomon Islands after 36 years.""We sincerely regret and strongly condemn the [Solomon Islands] government's decision to establish diplomatic relations with China,"" Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen said at the time.Malaita Province Premier Daniel Suidani has been outspoken in his opposition of the national government's decision to switch to China, and South Pacific geopolitical researcher Ed Cavanough said there was evidence that a relationship between the province and Taiwan remained in some form.Taiwan provided COVID-19 assistance such as personal protective equipment and food aid to Malaita, which Mr Cavanough said was in contravention of national law in Solomon Islands. Mr Suidani also travelled to Taiwan in May 2021 for medical treatment.Mr Sogavare said the decision to formalise ties with China was putting Solomon Islands on ""the right side of history"".But not all agreed, with opposition politicians fiercely criticising the move.In August 2019, a group of senior politicians published an open letter condemning the shift in relations.""We believe the long-term interests of our country — in terms of our development aspirations, as well as respect for democratic principles, human rights, rule of law, human dignity, and mutual respect — lie with Taiwan, not the PRC [People's Republic of China],"" it read.It also warned that establishing ties with Beijing could see land rights, rule of law and cultural heritage in Solomon Islands ""compromised"".""We are aware of important lessons from many countries — including in our region — who are locked in a serious debt trap as a result of their giving in to China's lures.""Mr Suidani has continued to rail against the decision, which Mr Cavanough said has served him to leverage ""incredible"" political popularity in Malaita Province.""We are strongly opposed to PRC communist ideology and investment,"" Mr Suidani was quoted by the Solomon Times newspaper as saying in May last year.Wednesday's protests appeared to come as a surprise despite recognition of building tensions.Maverick Peter Seda is a student at the Honiara campus of the University of the South Pacific who ran into the protests while returning home.He told the ABC people were ""shocked"" and ""freaking out"" about the protests and the subsequent lockdown.""Angry young people have just had enough,"" he said.Peter Kenilorea Jr, the son of Solomon Islands' first prime minister and an opposition MP, last month warned the country's foreign policy was being ""overrun"" by China and that disagreements over Beijing's influence could lead to violence.""Things don't build up very clearly in the Solomon Islands — things explode suddenly,"" he said in an interview with the Sunday Guardian, an Indian newspaper.""The analogy that I think is most apt is that we in the Pacific Islands say we are on the frontline of climate change — here in the Solomons, we are also on the frontline of the aggression

You could lose two or three kilometres of actual shoreline,"" Cr Fisher said.The beetle causes damage by boring into the plant's stem and feeding on the sap, damaging the developing leaves.The plant will then be defoliated and will die during a heavy infestation.The beetle lays eggs in decaying matter and then moves on.""We knew it was a risk, but it wasn't until it got into large horticulture and agriculture areas in Hawaii that suddenly the red flags went up,"" Cr Fisher said.He said Hawaii had similar horticulture and plant culture to Australia. On top of the obvious economic threat to the country's $2 billion sugar industry and $53 million pineapple industry, Cr Fisher said the beetle could pose a threat to other plants.""If it's in pineapples, what about bromeliads? It's an up-and-coming collector choice for gardeners. And if it can get into sugar cane, what is the risk to other canes and bamboos?"" he said.Cr Fisher said it was important to work with universities to find a new biological control to keep the insect at bay.Dr Etebari and his team at UQ are studying why the virus is no longer controlling the beetle and their findings would be critical to managing the pest if it got a foothold in Australia.""The question is how do we stop it? And what's gone wrong with the control that's been effective for the past five decades?"" Dr Etebari said.The researchers discovered that there have been several new waves of beetle invasions, not one as previously thought, as well as different types of beetles.They also found there were variations to the beetle virus which was originally sourced from Malaysia.""It's similar to how other scientists spot different strains of COVID-19. We are detecting variations in the beetle virus in the Pacific,"" Dr Etebari said.""In our case the problem is more complicated because there are different types of beetles and different strains of the beetle virus.""Their next step was finding out how the virus variations behaved in the different beetles and how that could be used to control them.Dr Etebari said it was important for Australia to help its Pacific neighbours to tackle the pest, not just for economic reasons, but also humanitarian. ""It's a serious threat to livelihoods across the Pacific islands as the coconut tree provides essential resources like food, copra, building material, and the coastal protection for more than five million vulnerable people,"" he said.A Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment spokesperson said it was working with biosecurity counterparts in PNG and Solomon Islands to track and monitor the spread of the new beetle strain.The department was also actively monitoring the spread of the beetle strains through PNG, particularly in the Western Province and PNG Treaty Village areas bordering Australia's northern Torres Strait Islands. The spokesperson said the department was also supporting regional initiatives that were dealing with the coconut rhinoceros beetle.ABC Capricornia will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Friday.

Domestic production gives us the upper hand against an uncertain global market and fragmented supply chains,"" he said in a statement.""This decision forecloses the option to donate vaccines to COVAX or share more future doses with the region. The Pacific and South-East Asia will need more vaccines and for a number of reasons, including stability, ease of transport and price, AZ is a highly effective option for the region.""Why sell ourselves short on building a healthier region and stronger partnerships?""In addition to the 40 million doses already committed, the government has pledged to supply a further 20 million vaccines to the region through UNICEF.It's also committed $100 million to an initiative from the ""Quad"" countries — the United States, Japan, India and Australia — to roll out around 1.2 billion vaccine doses in the Indo-Pacific.The government remains confident it can achieve close to full vaccine coverage of the Pacific through its existing commitments, although widespread vaccine resistance and poor health infrastructure in some countries — particularly Papua New Guinea — present formidable challenges.In contrast, Fiji has now vaccinated more than 80 per cent of its eligible population, largely using COVID-19 vaccines donated by Australia.The vaccine rollout is also gathering pace in countries like Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, although there are still some significant obstacles.Solomon Islands Health Minister Culwick Togamana told the ABC his country ""should be able to cover the target eligible population"" thanks to vaccines supplied by other countries, and that his country was grateful to Australia for its ""generous"" supply of doses.Papua New Guinea Health Minister Jelta Wong said his country had not been ""officially informed"" about the government's plans for the CSL contract, but said he was confident Australia would ""continue to provide vaccines to PNG, whether manufactured in Australia or purchased internationally"".""It's a strong commitment and understanding we have with the Australian government,"" he said. Read our full coverage on COVID-19 here","Australia, COVID-19, Disaster Relief, Fiji, Foreign Aid, Melbourne, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vaccines and Immunity, World Politics, ",2021-10-14T05:34:16+00:00

diving for sea cucumbers at night.The deaths last week of a 36-year-old man and another man in his 20s came less than a month after the country lifted a ban on harvesting the marine animal, also called beche-de-mer, in order to boost the economy after COVID-19.Royal Solomon Islands Police Force Provincial Assistant Commissioner Joseph Maneluga said he was concerned about the attacks, which occurred just a day apart.""I think the people are going crazy because of the reopening of the beche-de-mer,"" he said.""And the population of crocodiles is really increasing, and so that is the threat that we have.""Police enlisted assistance from Explosive Ordnance Device Unit divers, who are usually tasked to dispose of old World War II shells, to recover the bodies from the crocodile-infested waters.""It's quite risky because there are crocodiles still around those places and so it's not safe for our divers to go back to the same location to search for those people,"" Assistant Commissioner Maneluga said.Despite the threat of crocodile attacks, diver and marine biologist Stephen Attallifo Mosese said locals were not afraid to get in the water to harvest sea cucumbers.""I was amazed because Suava Bay in Malaita is a hotspot for crocodiles and ever since the reopening, you can see people diving out [at] the mangroves at night and you know that this is [the] time crocodiles are the most active,"" Mr Mosese said.Sea cucumbers are soft and squishy and, like their namesake, have a tube-like body.They are nocturnal and spend their lives on the dark depths of the sea floor feeding on detritus in the sediment.They play a vital role in the ocean's ecosystem by acting like an underwater vacuum cleaner, eating up waste, which helps balance ocean acidification.China and South-East Asian countries consider them a culinary delicacy and dried sea cucumbers are sometimes used in traditional medicines.A kilogram can fetch up to $170 in the Solomon Islands. Their phallic shape has earned them a suggestive nickname and they are often mistaken for an aphrodisiac.The demand for Pacific sea cucumbers is enormous, and depending on the species the export of this delicacy can make local divers big dollars.""It offers good, good money,"" diver Mr Mosese said.""Almost every business house in Solomon Islands, especially the Chinese, are interested in paying for beche-de-mer and the shops put out big posters saying 'We buy sea cucumber'.""There are also reports that Asian buyers are supplying local fishers with fuel, torches and batteries, leading more to go diving for the creatures.The Pacific sea cucumber trade has gone through cycles of boom and bust as traders exploit areas for stock.Stacy Jupiter, the Melanesia regional director for the Wildlife Conservation Society, said over-harvesting led to a ban on sea cucumber harvesting in Solomon Islands in 2019.""They basically exploit almost all of the sea cucumbers that can be harvested in a region until the populations in effect collapse,"" she said.""In some places over time the populations can recover, but in some places they don't.""The Solomon Islands government lifted the sea cucumber ban on September 1, citing economic hardships faced by the country due to the pandemic.The ban will be put back in place in September next year.Though the government has size limits to protect sea cucumber populations, a lack of resources means there is little enforcement of the policy.Some local fishers have also complained they have been underpaid for their catch.Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said people from neighbouring Papua New Guinea, which is battling a COVID-19 outbreak, had been crossing the border to harvest beche-de-mer, putting Solomon Islanders at risk of infection. ""Several people from Bougainville [in PNG] have crossed the border to harvest bech-de-mer on our side of the border and they have interacted with several people,"" he said.While divers are celebrating the removal of the sea cucumber ban, another wildlife ban has made their jobs more dangerous.Thirty years ago, Solomon Islands decided to ban the export of crocodiles, leading to a population boom across the country.To help protect divers and others who live near rivers, some people are calling for a crocodile cull to reduce numbers.But Dr Jupiter said killing crocodiles was not

Minister of Solomon Islands receiving the first Sinopharm shot in the region. China delivered 50,000 doses of Sinopharm to the capital Honiara before the vaccine was approved, but Friday's launch clears its use across the Pacific nation.""Solomon Islands is the first country to put Sinopharm vaccines into its national roll-out plan,"" Li Ming, China's ambassador to the Solomon Islands, said.""That proves China and Solomon Islands are genuine friends and trustworthy partners.""Solomon Islands will offer Sinopharm alongside the AstraZeneca vaccine to frontline workers and ""special groups"", including students who plan to travel to China, in what officials say is an integral step to get the population vaccinated.""Had we not had this second option [of the Sinopharm vaccine] we will be placed in a very difficult situation where certain parts of our country may not be able to have the chance to be vaccinated,"" said Health Minister Culwick Togamana.It comes the same week as Australia offers a further 60,000 doses of its locally-made AstraZeneca vaccine to the Pacific nation, in what some say points to a growing diplomatic rivalry between China and Australia in the region.China has also pledged to provide 200,000 doses of Sinopharm to Papua New Guinea, which is working to control a growing outbreak.Sinopharm was approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization earlier this month — the first COVID-19 vaccine developed by a non-Western nation to receive this backing.The reported efficacy of Sinopharm is 79 per cent.The green light allows it to be included in COVAX, a global initiative to provide vaccines to low-income countries.But that facility is only committed to providing 20 per cent of a country's vaccine needs, which means many Pacific nations will need to find international donors to fill the gaps.Australia has already made 58,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine available to Pacific countries, including PNG, Fiji, Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste.Recent updates from AstraZeneca suggest an efficacy of 76 per cent, up from the initial 62-70 per cent reported from phase 3 clinical trials.Pacific health officials say they are not concerned about where their vaccines come from — just that they will protect their citizens.""Where it's approved by WHO, and if it's in the country, we are to use and roll that out,"" Pauline McNeil, Solomon Islands' permanent secretary for health and medical services, said.But there are some early concerns over Sinopharm's efficacy.United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, both early adopters of the vaccine, have recently announced the roll-out of a third booster shot amid complaints of an insufficient antibody response following the first two Sinopharm doses.Professor Fiona Russell from the University of Melbourne — who is on a WHO technical working group for COVID-19 vaccinations in the Western Pacific — said the possible need for three doses of Sinopharm ""might be an issue"" for Pacific countries with limited health budgets.""If this is going to be an annual thing, then that's a real pain, it's just really difficult,"" Professor Russell said.She also raised concerns around challenges Pacific health workers might face in administering both the Sinopharm and AstraZeneca vaccines.Both brands require at least two doses, but have differing schedules around when those shots need to be given and the number of doses per vial.""It does make things more complicated ... particularly [for] small countries, which have got fewer human resources,"" Professor Russell said.""If there are two different vaccines going on in the community in the small countries at the same time, that makes it even more challenging.""Solomon Islands has delivered special training to health workers to help them administer the Sinopharm vaccine correctly. Jelta Wong, PNG's Health Minister, said he welcomed the additional vaccines donated by China.""We think that it is good to have a variety of vaccines in the country for our people,"" he said.Mr Wong earlier indicated Sinopharm would only be made available to Chinese citizens, but now says locals who want it instead of AstraZeneca can have it too.""If they are not comfortable with taking the AstraZeneca, at least we have another vaccine that they're comfortable to take,"" he said.Sinopharm is said to be a key component of China's ""vaccine diplomacy"", where hundreds of millions of doses of Chinese-made vaccines are being offered to low-and middle-income countries around the world.""China will also readily consider providing COVID-19 vaccines to these countries in light of their needs through various ways, making China's contribution by ensuring the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in the Pacific island countries,"" Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying said earlier this year.In the Pacific, China's attempts to woo government leaders have faced further scrutiny amid accusations it is expanding its geopolitical base.Less than two years ago, Beijing convinced Solomon Islands and Kiribati to sever ties with Taipei, and Australian leaders have warned of China's growing threat in the Indo-Pacific.Jonathan Pryke from the Lowy Institute said, in the case of COVID-19 vaccines, the perception of a diplomatic rivalry can be beneficial for small Pacific states.""Every area is now framed in this geopolitical competition in the Pacific and it does help generate more momentum and more ambition,"" Mr Pryke said.""It does put pressure on Australia to provide viable alternatives.""But he believes there is a more important objective at stake.""Ultimately it's in everyone's interest to have a well-vaccinated Pacific so we can all open up to each other faster and safely,"" he said.Pacific public health expert Dr Colin Tukuitonga doesn't think many Pacific islanders will care where vaccines come from, just that they provide protection against COVID-19.""China's in the region with the support of many governments and clearly they see some benefit,"" he said.""The vaccine supply to developing countries and particularly small island states is always going to be fragile.""Solomon Islands is considered COVID-free, without a single case of community transmission.Read our full coverage on COVID-19 hereAdditional reporting by Prianka Srinivasan","COVID-19,

So I wasn't shocked that this was so big and protracted as a public health event,"" she said.""But in terms of the response and restrictions level, I never could have foreseen that it would be like this.""In May 2020, the couple got engaged and began working out how to reunite so they could start planning the rest of their lives, such as buying a house and starting a family.With borders shut, they applied for a travel exemption for Mr Esau to travel to Australia on immediate family and compelling or compassionate grounds.Their application was denied, so they applied again and again.Mr Esau was repeatedly told by Australian Border Force that his ""circumstances do not outweigh the risk to the Australian community"", according to a document seen by the ABC.""You feel like you are baring your soul to a robot or … someone on the end of the ABF email who gets to look at all the most intimate details of our relationship and then goes, 'Nah',"" Ms Wheeler said.""It was awful.""Solomon Islands has been free of local transmission and recorded just 20 imported cases since the start of the pandemic.Ms Wheeler turned to her local Newcastle MP Sharon Claydon for help, who told their story in a speech to Parliament and wrote a letter to then-Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton.Ms Claydon believed there were strong grounds for Mr Esau to be allowed into Australia.""We knew of the [Solomon Islands'] COVID-free status, we knew of … strong compassionate grounds, and the other argument was we should not be losing a skilled epidemiologist at the heart of the pandemic,"" she said.Australia's Department of Home Affairs said it did not comment on individual cases.Ms Claydon has been helping others in similar situations as Ms Wheeler.""My office was assisting dozens and dozens of … Australians who were trying to get their families and partners to return,"" she said.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said there were 47,300 Australians registered as wanting to return home.Ms Claydon said there were tens of thousands of families wanting to enter the country to see relatives.""They've all got heartbreaking stories to tell,"" she said.Australian National University demographer Liz Allen said the lack of migration because of border closures could put the country's economic wellbeing at risk.""Australia is faced with an uncertain socio-demographic future, where living standards could go backwards,"" she said.With their reunion plans in limbo, Ms Wheeler and Mr Esau joined a Facebook group called Partners Apart, a place where separated couples could discuss their issues.Ms Wheeler said she noticed partners living in Western countries appeared to be getting approval to enter Australia.""The border immigration system in Australia is inherently racist,"" Ms Wheeler said.Ms Claydon said this was a trend she and her parliamentary colleagues had also noticed.""Where people were getting compassionate entries, they were … much more readily granted to people coming from wealthy Western nations,"" she said.""And if you are from the poor, developing nations … that has proven to be extremely difficult.""Dr Allen said the country still had White Australia hang-ups.""In times of fear, people tend to want to protect their own and fear the other — migrants bear the brunt of this,"" she said.""It pains me to say that Australia has shown disregard for the human rights of citizens with overseas-born partners.""Australian Border Force said the primary consideration for the grant of any exemptions was the public health advice provided by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and the risk posed by overseas travellers.The process of continually applying for applications and being rejected took a toll on Ms Wheeler's mental health.""It really feels like you are nothing, you're just a pawn in the game, and for those of us who have been separated from family and loved ones … it feels like we've sacrificed a lot in the last year and a half to keep everyone safe.""Having put their relationship on hold for 19 months, the couple decided to stop trying to get Mr Esau into Australia, and instead Ms Wheeler uprooted and moved to the Solomon Islands.In September, she boarded a flight from Brisbane and spent three weeks in hotel quarantine in the capital Honiara.When she was released, Mr Esau was there waiting to pick her up.""We saw each other and it was just … just like I could breathe,"" she said.""We just stood there holding each other.""They've now moved into a house on a hill overlooking lush green palm trees.Happy couple selfies are stuck to their fridge and they've gone on their first beach holiday.After a harrowing journey to be reunited they've slipped into a peaceful rhythm of domestic bliss.""It's been so lovely … to go to the market to have brunch on the weekend … go for a walk, just normal stuff that makes life enjoyable and lovely to share with someone,"" she

Some of the stuff was tossed in the ocean,"" said John Rodsted, Pacific Islands coordinator for SafeGround. ""The troops were in a hurry to get home, which they did do. And they left the local people with a dangerous legacy permanently.""Mr Rodsted said rapid development in many Pacific islands could lead to more blasts as people built on land that had yet been cleared.He said some locals might not realise how dangerous these remnants were.""There's a problem in some places where people seek out old munitions to cut them in half and make crude, handmade bombs to go fishing with,"" he said.""It destroys the ecosystem, destroys the reefs to get a few dead fish, and regularly goes wrong and kills those people too.""He said Japan needed to ""step up"" and support local officers in the bomb disposal too.""Donor nations need to stick their hands in their pockets and get some real funding out,"" he said.""To think that people live with this 76 years after the war ended is outrageous.""","Pacific, Solomon Islands, Unrest, Conflict and War, World Politics, World War 2, ",2021-05-10T19:17:18+00:00

She said he had not yet gained his accreditation and was learning on the job.But his colleague and friend, Mr Atkinson, was an NPA program manager who was considered a veteran in the sector.He had the relevant accreditation and treated Mr Lee ""like his prodigy,"" Ms Thorne said.The NPA program was established in 2019 following a request by the Solomon Islands government.But the program there has been suspended since the blast and will remain that way until the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force releases its own report into what happened.The NPA has previously said the safe removal and disposal of UXO was outside its scope in the Solomon Islands, and the only body authorised to do so was the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force explosive ordnance team.But another recent explosion has put locals on alert.Two young men were killed earlier this month after an old World War II shell, hidden underground, exploded when they lit a fire.Ms Thorne said she was appalled by what she saw as a lack of urgency and responsibility to rid the country of both American and Japanese UXO.""It's been 75 years since this war happened. It's all still there, there's going to be more lives that are lost. So when are they going to be held to account?"" she said.""This is about a clean-up operation … whatever it takes, but absolutely send in the troops, send in the military.""US ambassador to the Solomon Islands Erin McKee has not ruled out carrying out that suggestion.""The mass removal operation … would have to be requested by the Solomon Islands government with specific objectives in mind so that each of the partners involved are invited to renew our engagement, and is very clear on the steps that we would take forward and the roles and responsibilities of each partner as they engaged in this effort.""But she reiterated the NPA program would remain suspended indefinitely.""We are continuing to press our Solomon Islands colleagues to both conclude their investigation and submit the report so we can close out the NPA arrangement as well as request renewed support and partnership from the United States,"" Ms McKee said.The Solomon Islands government and Royal Solomon Islands Police Force have been contacted for comment by the ABC but have not responded.But when contacted about the deaths earlier this month, Inspector Clifford Tunuki, from the Solomon Islands' Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team, said he expected a report would be fast-tracked in light of recent events.Until a solution to the ordnance littering the islands is found, Ms Thorne fears the World War II battle will keep claiming lives.""I'd like to think that Luke and Trent didn't lose their lives in vain,"" she said.""I would like to think that it's enough to raise awareness for these countries to step up.""I know that it would make them very happy to make sure that Solomon Islanders people don't have to live in fear anymore.""","Pacific, Solomon Islands, Unrest, Conflict and War, World Politics, World War 2, ",2021-05-31T20:29:40+00:00

The doses will be drawn from stockpiles manufactured by CSL in its new Melbourne plant.The process will begin in May, but the government is confident it can ramp up delivery quickly after that. It is aiming to achieve 20 per cent coverage in the Pacific by the end of June, with help from vaccines distributed under the COVAX facility.Mr Morrison is also expected to announce the government will grant a request from Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape, who has asked Australia for an immediate supply of COVID-19 vaccines for frontline health workers in his country.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicPNG's health system has been placed under enormous strain by the pandemic. The numbers of new cases are spiking dramatically, and officials warning hospitals are now close to collapse.One federal government source confirmed that Australia had agreed to help PNG by supplying it with an immediate and “limited” supply of vaccines for medical and other essential workers. They did not say exactly how many doses would be provided. Australian and PNG officials have been in near-constant communication as they hammer out a coordinated response to the rapidly escalating health threat.  The situation in PNG has been deteriorating steadily. In the first week of March, 17 per cent of all people who were tested throughout the country were positive to COVID-19 and Mr Marape said earlier this week that one in three or four people in PNG could soon be infected.Some 114 staff at PNG's largest hospital, the Port Moresby General Hospital, have now tested positive to COVID-19.""We expect more cases to come in the next few weeks or so and we can't afford to lose our staff, the way we are going, so we're looking forward to the vaccinations so we can protect our staff,"" hospital chief excutive Paki Molumi told the ABC.Aid groups have also been pressing the government to take action to help PNG cope with the health crisis.A federal government spokesman said that Mr Morrison spoke to Mr Marape on Tuesday afternoon to finalise a support package.""The Prime Minister spoke to Prime Minister Marape about the ongoing situation and what more Australia can do to support the PNG government, and also protect both countries,” they said.The federal government's announcement on the broader vaccine rollout has been anticipated for weeks. It has previously announced it will spend $200 million on delivering COVID-19 vaccines to Pacific Island countries. But today's announcement will likely provide more details on which countries will be prioritised, as well as the timetable for distribution.The rollout is expected to initially focus on a number of Melanesian countries including Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Timor Leste is also expected to be a high priority, as are some very small Pacific Island states.The Pacific rollout is one of several vaccine commitments from the federal government, which is ramping up efforts to boost the region's health response and cement Australian diplomatic influence.The government has already pledged $80 million to the Gavi COVAX Facility, which is being used to distribute vaccines to low-income countries across the globe, including in the Pacific.Australia has also pledged to distribute vaccines in some South-East Asian countries and on the weekend joined a new vaccine initiative from the Quad, which has vowed to ramp up vaccine production by 1 billion doses by 2022.","Asia, Australia, COVID-19, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Vaccines and Immunity, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2021-03-16T19:14:53+00:00

They had previously been evacuated from other islands in Kiribati two decades earlier in the 1930s, again due to drought.As a result, the residents of Wagina have a completely different culture to the communities on nearby islands in Solomon Islands.And while the colonial administration considered Wagina Island to be uninhabited at the time of the resettlement, tribal groups in Solomon Islands have since contested its ownership.Ms Biribo said the Minister of Environment's decision to reject the appeal has affirmed her people's right to live on the island.""We stayed here for 50 years. When I received this news it's a beginning for us, it is a recognition of who we are, the Minister recognises us,"" she said.""If the Government can continue to recognise us, give us political equality and land rights for us as minority group here.""Wagina Island residents used a previously untried provision within the country's environment law to challenge the company's right to mine there.Lawyer William Kadi from the Public Solicitors Office in the capital Honiara represented the islanders — an undertaking he said proved difficult at times given how far away Wagina Island is, and patchy mobile phone coverage.He said the case would have major implications beyond Wagina, providing a model for other rural communities who feel powerless against companies with Government-issued mining or logging licences in their area.""It gives hopes for us to see that there's another alternative avenue … to challenge decisions made by [the] public authority without going to the courts,"" Mr Kadi said.Solomon Bauxite Limited still has an existing mining lease on the island, however it will need to re-apply for a new development consent if it wants to attempt to mine on the island again.The ABC has sought comment from Solomon Bauxite Limited's country representative.","Environment, Environmental Impact, Pacific, Solomon Islands, ",2020-11-06T19:23:58+00:00

An active rehabilitation program could reduce the time to 50 years.Lawyer William Kadi from the Public Solicitors Office told the ABC he was preparing a compensation case on behalf of Rennell Islanders.Mr Kadi said he had been waiting for the Government to release the report so his clients could put a figure to their compensation demand.Secretary of the Solomon Islands' Environment Ministry Dr Melchior Mataki said follow-up assessments have been planned, but it was unclear when that would happen.""A lot of the work was supposed to be done this year, but then with the ongoing COVID-19 issue it has really affected our capabilities to actually mobilise resources to get our staff down there,"" he told the ABC.Dr Mataki said the damage assessment report was released to ""stakeholders"" after being approved by cabinet.He said the Government recently signed an international shipping convention that would allow it to pursue the ship owner's insurer for compensation.","Environment, Environmental Impact, Mining Environmental Issues, Oil and Gas, Pacific, Solomon Islands, ",2020-11-26T05:45:23+00:00

In the Pacific, Solomon Islands is next with $157 million.""It still won't make [the US] anywhere near as big a donor to the Pacific as Australia is, Australia will remain the dominant donor in the Pacific,"" Dr Wood told the ABC.The Lowy Institute's Pacific aid map, which was released last week, showed Chinese aid to the Pacific halved in 2019, to $169.7 million from $339.3 million in 2018.But promises of a new stadium in the Solomon Islands for the 2023 Pacific Games, the region's largest sporting event, is believed to have influenced policy in Beijing's favour in the country.Dr Wood said the escalation in US aid funding was surprising.""All the more so because in 2018, the United States only gave about $1.6 million to all of Solomon Islands,"" he said.""So, it seems to be a remarkable increase in interest in the country, and in particular, in one province.""The United States is going to become a very large presence in Malaita all of a sudden.""Other funding through the Pacific Pledge is also set to benefit the Solomon Islands, but specific amounts have not been laid out for the country.The program will focus on agricultural and environmental development over a five-year period.China has claimed Taiwan as its territory.Under its One China policy, it denies any region in its territory the right to form diplomatic relations with other countries.""I'd almost certainly think that the United States is focusing on Malaita right now because it's seen as a potential source of support, in its own geostrategic struggle with China in the region"", said Dr Wood.Chad Morris, public affairs officer for the US Embassy in Papua New Guinea, which is also responsible for the Solomons, has denied the aid was politically motivated.He said the plans have been in the works for two years.""The timing of the announcement around the money and funding approval is the normal course of business,"" he said.""There is no intention to make this a political move.""Anti-Chinese sentiment in the Malaita province was further exacerbated when Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare allowed a charter flight from China to enter the country, which had not yet recorded a case of coronavirus.It has since confirmed two cases of COVID-19.This prompted the Premier of Malatia, Daniel Suidani, to call for a referendum on independence.The announcement was welcomed by the provincial Government.Premier Suidani said in a statement: ""Nothing in such magnitude has ever been seen and felt by my people of Malaita Province since Solomon Islands gained independent in 1978. It is a great gift from a friend indeed.""The Solomon Islands Government has responded cautiously.""Meanwhile, the National Government wishes to caution certain groups and individuals within the country, especially, the people of Malaita Province to respect proper Government processes and mechanisms in dealing with aid assistance,"" it said in a statement.The Government said a detailed plan on how the money would be spent and what activities would be carried out would have to be developed first and then approved by cabinet.Mr Morris said the USAid program has the blessing of both the Solomon Islands' national and provincial governments.""While the focus in on Malaita, that does not mean other provinces within the Solomon Islands won't also benefit,"" said Mr Morris.Dr Wood urged countries giving aid to think about the welfare of all those who live in the region.""That's what really matters,"" he said.""It's the wellbeing of people [in the] Pacific, not these geostrategic tussles"".

For Dr Len Tarivonda, Vanuatu's Director of Public Health, the situation presents a unique challenge to the country's under-resourced healthcare system. He said a lack of testing kits has meant less than 10 per cent of the 2,193 recent arrivals have been tested for COVID-19.""We are doing testing only on people coming from high-risk areas, categorised by the number of active cases,"" Dr Tarivonda said.""We don't have enough test kits and also the testing capacity here [is not enough], so the decision was made to only test those who are coming from medium- to high-risk areas.""Despite the low testing rates, Dr Tarivonda said the risk of an infection spreading outside of Vanuatu's quarantine facilities remained low.The Government has introduced further restrictions on international travel as a result of the first recorded COVID-19 case. International travellers will now spend 28 days in quarantine, instead of the earlier 14, and will need to provide a negative COVID-19 test result 72 hours before their departing flight.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicMany Pacific economies rely on tourism, and have faced financial crises during the pandemic.That outlook prompted French Polynesia to open its borders to international tourists in July.Within a month, it had recorded 70 new cases of COVID-19, with bars and restaurants visited by tourists identified as hotspots for transmission.The Government soon faced public backlash for its decision; Tahiti resident Vehia Wheeler said in August ""it feels like we are disposable as a population"".But the French Territory continued to encourage people to visit, putting in place certain measures, like mandatory face masks and limits to public gatherings, as a means to limit the infection's spread.Cruise ships even resumed their travel through the archipelago.French Polynesia's Government has underscored the need to keep its economy afloat through the pandemic.""The measures taken to open the territory were necessary to support the economic and social lives of the country,"" French Ambassador for the territory, Dominique Sorain, said.More than 4 per cent of its population has now been infected with COVID-19, and as recently as Wednesday, French Polynesia recorded 345 new COVID-19 cases.French Polynesia's President Édouard Fritch tested positive to the virus last month, two days after visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.In contrast, the neighbouring French Pacific territory of New Caledonia has banned all incoming air travel, except for repatriation flights and freight, until March, 2021.It has no active COVID-19 cases and has recorded no cases of community transmission.Papua New Guinea recorded its first case of COVID-19 back in March, but its numbers have remained relatively low since then.To date, the country has confirmed fewer than 600 cases and seven deaths.Many believe that's because of PNG's low testing rates, and health authorities have urged more people to come forward if they have any COVID-19 symptoms.The World Health Organization has said it was working with PNG's health authorities to introduce a rapid test kit that would increase its testing capacity.""Exactly when that rapid testing will be available and how it will be rolled out still need to be planned more at this point of time,"" said Dr Tauhid Islam, WHO's officer in charge.PNG scientists have been trying to determine whether Papua New Guineans could be less susceptible to the virus.Tamara Koleala, a molecular scientist from PNG's Institute of Medical Research (IMR), said COVID-19 might be behaving differently in PNG than elsewhere in the world.""In PNG, in September, the National Control Centre reported that about 55 per cent of people who were infected were asymptomatic, so we're trying to find out how a person is affected by [COVID-19] and one of those reasons could be genetic,"" Dr Koleala said.Dr Koleala has recently received funding from the Australian Government to carry out a range of COVID-19 related research.Despite border closures and bans on flights, many Pacific countries rely on international shipping for the flow of goods and supplies.But three recent COVID-19 infections aboard a container ship in American Samoa have put a spotlight on the industry, and the risks it brings to the region's ports.Bekiri Sitki Ustaoglu, head of the Asia Pacific Section at the International Maritime Organization, said the Pacific can't shutdown its maritime routes. ""International shipping is the carrier of the world, if we do not take measures to let international shipping continue its services, then things will get from bad to worse,"" Mr Ustaoglu said.""As the Pacific Islands are composed of island states and archipelagos, they are very much dependent on shipping.""Pacific port authorities were further concerned earlier this month when a cargo ship that anchored off Queensland was found to be infected with a mutated COVID-19 strain.That ship, the Sofrana Surville, had passed through several Pacific countries before reaching Australia, including Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia.Paul Griffin, an Associate Professor at Queensland University who specialises in infectious diseases, said the source of the new strain could not be determined without a genomic match.But he said Pacific ports could not be ruled out as a potential source of the mutated strain.""I think certainly there would be areas in the Pacific where testing would be challenging, let alone genomic, so it's possible it originated from there,"" Dr Griffin said.","COVID-19, Disease Outbreak, French Polynesia, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Travel Health and Safety, Vanuatu, ",2020-11-12T18:40:09+00:00

The effort to have Zaira declared a protected area has involved extensive research to document the biological and cultural significance of the land.One of the people who contributed to that effort is Australian National University biologist Dr Tyrone Lavery. ""I first went to Zaira in 2010 and it was just a transformative experience for me,"" he said.""I'd never seen anything like what I saw at Zaira, the forest that's there, the people and their relationship with the forest.""Dr Lavery says the coastline is also an important rookery for vulnerable leatherback turtles.Its untouched forests are home to two rare mammals found only in this part of Solomon Islands; the New Georgia monkey-faced bat and the Vangunu giant rat, which Dr Lavery documented for the first time in 2017.""As far as we know that only occurs on Vangunu and also it appears as though it only appears in the primary forest, so it's really dependent on the bush at Zaira that hasn't been logged yet,"" he said.Another researcher who's helped Zaira's conservation push is environmental scientist Dr Simon Albert from the University of Queensland.He said it was hard to overstate the area's importance.""Zaira is literally the last remaining piece of marine and forest environment that starts at 500 metres below the ocean, across the coral reef ecosystem to the coast and all the way up to 1,000 metres,"" he said.""We've got an intact corridor of biodiversity that is unlike anything else that exists in the western Solomons.""But the push for protected area status remains in limbo, with the ministries of forestry and mining yet to approve the application.

""They will die for their land.""

In the Pacific, Solomon Islands is next with $157 million.DFAT said the programs in Solomons and PNG have both fallen by around $20 million because of the completion of the Coral Sea underwater cable project.Aid programs to Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Kiribati have been increased.Jonathan Pryke, director of the Lowy Institute's Pacific Islands Program said the ongoing Pacific focus of Australian aid will be welcomed in the region but Pacific leaders are really waiting for the return of Australian tourists to reboot their battered economies.""The bigger prize is to just get these borders back open as quickly as possible with Australian and New Zealand,"" he said.""That isn't going to come from the aid program, that's going to come from keeping our COVID numbers down here, and goodwill from governments in the Pacific and Australia to get moving on opening those borders as quickly as possible.""Separate to the aid program, the Federal Government will also spend $124.3 million over 10 years on infrastructure projects in the South-West Pacific, as part of the Pacific step-up policy.This will include the construction of a border and patrol boat outpost in Solomon Islands' western provinces — an initiative that was first announced one year ago.The continued focus on the Pacific has again meant reductions in funding to other parts of the world.Fiona Yap, deputy director of ANU's Crawford School of Public Policy, said Australia needs to be concerned about regional stability in South-East Asia.""In the Philippines, with a strongman in charge, and in Indonesia, with the potential polarisation in these countries, the pandemic is going to be able to sow seeds of discontent,"" she said.""Then you add the economic downturn in each of these countries to that, and that would be a recipe for instability. So Australia really should step up at this point.""Professor Yap said Australia was looking at aid as charity, ""which is exactly what it is not"", and ignoring the potential to help development of close neighbours into possible future markets.Pasanna Mutha, policy and government relations manager at Plan International Australia, said it was great to see $65 million allocated to address gender-based violence and women's economic empowerment in the Pacific and South-East Asia.But she said funding allocated for women sometimes meant that adolescent girls ""fall through the cracks"".""In the Pacific, especially … the rates of secondary school enrolment for adolescent girls is really low. And with the lockdowns, and so many school closures, we're going to see a huge number of girls not returning to school,"" she said.""We've seen that over a number of years in our international development program that the focus has shifted away from Africa, which is unfortunate, given that there are high numbers of displaced people in the in the continent, and the growing food crisis.""Aid to south and west Asia has been slashed by $72 million with Afghanistan and Pakistan the big losers.Australia's funding to the Middle East and Africa has been cut in half and now stands at $93 million.The CEO of the Australian Council for International Development Marc Purcell said the cuts are disappointing, particularly those in Asia.""Without some increase overall what we are seeing is the erosion of Australia's aid program in different countries,"" he said.""For example in Afghanistan, where so many Australians have fought bravely with Afghan people, and we said we'd never cut and run, aid has been cut by 34 per cent.""","Asia, Australia, COVID-19, Disaster Relief, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, Health, Indonesia, International Aid and Trade, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Solomon Islands, ",2020-10-06T22:18:31+00:00

Tensions between Malaita Province in the country's east and the national government have been rising ever since.The Malaita Provincial Government remains supportive of Taiwan and was reprimanded by the national government earlier this year when it accepted COVID-19 donations from the government in Taipei.A statement from Premier of Malaita Daniel Suidani this week said that ""with the continued pressure from the national government for Malaita to accept PRC [People's Republic of China] … it is time for Malaita people to see whether they are willing to be part of a country whose leadership is becoming dictatorial"".Mr Suidani told the ABC his administration would go ahead with a referendum to make Malaita an independent state.""The province is starting to get the framework, we will make sure what the people like … our idea of getting the island to look after themselves must come true,"" he said.But the call for self-determination in the province has been simmering for decades.Peter Kenilorea Junior, a member of the National Parliament from Malaita Province, said while the views of his province should be respected, any process looking at independence would be a long and complex one.""It's a heavily political issue. Anyone's right to self-determination to be recognised under international law, is something that would have to involve the national government too,"" he said. ""This sentiment for independence has been simmering for some time but in my view, the recent events have perhaps made the Premier look to move towards this now"".The recent events alluded to by Mr Kenilorea Jr include this week's flight from the Chinese city of Guangzhou, which was chartered by the Solomon Islands Government and paid for by the Chinese Government.Churches, civil society groups and politicians have voiced their anxieties about the flight because Solomon Islands has no confirmed cases of COVID-19.Mr Suidani was one of the most vocal against the decision to allow the flight to land. ""You talk so much about looking after our borders and looking after the health issues,"" he said.""But then you send a flight to get 88 Chinese people to Solomons, is that the way to look after our people?""But Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said the flight was a national priority, with the country needing the economic growth that would come with the construction of a new stadium and facilities. ""I'm fully aware that some decisions might not go down well with some of our fellow citizens, let me assure you all, that all decisions are made after careful assessment and analysis based on evidence,"" he said.""We, your leaders, have been mandated by the people to serve in the best interest of our nation and its citizens.""China brought its outbreak under control and has reported just 169 cases in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University.The flight, though, brought unease in the capital of Malaita Province, Auki, where an unhappy community group issued notices for the town's Chinese-owned stores to close down and leave town. ""As part of our stand against China's dealing within this country, we are staging an evacuation protest to all Chinese citizens who are currently residing and operating businesses in Auki,"" it read.""All Chinese business operators are asked to leave Auki of Malaita province to Honiara within the next 24 hours.""The stores in Auki were temporarily closed on Wednesday but the situation has eased after police mediation.Solomon Islands Police Commissioner Mostyn Mangau said they would continue investigating and it was not yet clear if charges would be laid.""This doesn't look good, it's not in our legal process to threaten someone who has a legal standing to be here … when you use such documents that have no legal basis, you're breaking the law,"" he said.The incident has triggered memories of 2006, when Chinese businesses in the capital, Honiara, were targeted and burnt in the Chinatown riots, forcing hundreds of Chinese nationals to flee the country.","COVID-19, China, Community and Society, Diseases and Disorders, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Sport, World Politics, ",2020-09-03T08:27:57+00:00

""Our essential workers and healthcare workers have been the beating heart of our response.""The Pacific Islands, which include Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Nauru, Samoa and Tonga, have been able to make the enviable claim of being ""COVID-free"" because they were quick to close their borders, knowing their health systems would not cope with any large outbreak.But in Papua New Guinea, Guam and French Polynesia, the numbers are going up.Despite boasting their ""COVID-free"" status, many of the tourism-dependent Pacific countries are facing an economic crisis.""The economy's in shreds, tourism is practically non-existent. People have lost their jobs, people are hungry.

But some critics say the funds could have been better used to develop Pacific broadcasting capabilities, strengthen independent journalism in the region or showcase content more relevant to Pacific audiences. Broadcasters in Papua New Guinea welcomed the move, saying they had been consulted and had chosen content they thought would suit their audiences. But they also hoped Pacific content would be beamed onto Australian TVs.""I'm sure there are a lot of happy people around PNG today,"" Sheena Hughes, acting CEO of EMTV, said after The Voice premiered last night. ""There have been a lot of concerns raised, but we have gone into consultations, and we have been able to choose content that we feel is relevant for our station.""We would have possibly preferred to get some of those funds to be able to build our local content, but I'm hoping that this is a platform for future initiatives and future partnerships … hopefully down the line we do look at upgrading or putting some funding into our local programs, so content can also be shared with Australia.""Kora Nou, from the chronically underfunded National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) in PNG, said acquiring TV content was an expensive exercise, so the initiative filled some holes in the station's broadcasting and freed up money to be spent elsewhere. But he would also like to see money funnelled into local productions. ""While initially we are happy to welcome this content on our televisions, for us, down the line, we would encourage some arrangement where our technical and production staff can feed off their counterparts in Australia,"" he said. ""So that we cannot only learn from them but also … in the longer term we can have some PNG content on Australian screens as well.""Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Fiji will be the first broadcast shows, including Neighbours, MasterChef, The Voice, 60 Minutes, House Rules, Border Security: Australia's Frontline and children's program Totally Wild on free-to-air channels, under the initiative delivered by Free TV Australia.In the coming months, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Nauru will follow.Ms Hughes added her station was hoping to be able to broadcast the NRL, as it had in the past. Nine Entertainment pays $115 million for NRL broadcast rights. ""We believe strongly any sporting program should be able to be broadcasted to Papua New Guineans nationwide,"" she said. Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister, Marise Payne, said Free TV Australia was finalising arrangements for sports like netball, cricket, soccer, AFL and NRL to be broadcast.Ms Hughes added the initiative ""couldn't have come at a better time,"" as the COVID-19 pandemic impacted on advertising and businesses. Some have viewed the initiative as flexing some 'soft power' muscle to counter China's growing influence in the region.The ABC's Radio Australia switched off shortwave transmissions across the Pacific in January of 2017.About 18 months later, China's state-owned broadcaster China Radio International took over the radio frequencies.ABC Radio Australia continues to broadcast on FM to urban populations in the Pacific, and the ABC still runs an international TV service in the region.Last year, two Pacific countries — Solomon Islands and Kiribati — switched their diplomatic allegiances from Taiwan to China.Graeme Smith, an expert on China and the Pacific at the Australian National University, said Australia and China had two different approaches to soft power.He said China's focus tended to be about controlling the way ""the China story is told"", and that it tended to promote aspects of its culture, like martial arts, traditional medicine and anything related to ""ancient Chinese wisdom"". ""Neighbours doesn't count as ancient Chinese wisdom … or any sort of wisdom really,"" he said.Dr Smith said the initiative was ""trying to promote Australian values"", but that a lack of diversity might fail to represent Pacific viewers.""Australian commercial television tends to be very white, but what people like to see on the screen is themselves … it's unlikely to feature too many strong Pacific island characters in the mix,"" he said.He said a better strategy might be to emulate projects like Love Patrol, a Vanuatu drama supported by Australian aid, which he described as a ""huge soft power win"". ""If they're looking to have more influence, soft-power-wise, in the Pacific, they should be looking to support local content production, rather than expecting people to watch Neighbours and relate to it,"" he said.Minister for International Development and the Pacific Alex Hawke said the ""PacificAus TV initiative is a terrific demonstration of shared cultural ties and links between Australia and the Pacific"", while Senator Payne said ""having the opportunity to watch the same stories on our screens will only deepen the connection with our Pacific family"". Bruce Dover from Australia Asia Pacific Media Initiative, which wants a revitalised Australian media presence in the Pacific, posted on Facebook that it was ""sad to think how much better the money could have been spent"".Mr Dover, a former head of the Australia Network, which was run by the ABC but funded by the Australian Foreign Affairs Department, described the project as a $17 million ""thought bubble"" by Prime Minister Scott Morrison and would have liked to see more spent on co-production, skills mentoring, children's programming and strengthening independent journalism in the Pacific.He previously told the ABC that without consultation the project would smack of ""white colonialism"" and said Pacific voices needed to be prioritised.","Australia, China, Information and Communication, Kiribati, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Television, Television Broadcasting, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2020-05-25T09:37:29+00:00

This in fact used to be an airstrip,"" Mr Smith said, while gesturing to where construction is due to start.

New Zealand first eliminated community transmission of the virus by imposing a strict lockdown in late March when only about 100 people had tested positive for the disease.Some prominent local health experts suggested it was more likely the virus had been quietly spreading in Auckland for weeks, despite efforts to eradicate it with an initial five-week hard lockdown.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the latest outbreak appeared to be a new strain, which may suggest NZ was successful in its first eradication and the virus had now been reintroduced.""The sequence of the virus from the current outbreak is not the same as the sequences from community cases in our first original outbreak in New Zealand.""In other words, not from a dormant community transmission from the beginning of the pandemic.""Since the return of new infections, New Zealand has reimposed tight restrictions and authorities expect case numbers to climb in the coming days.But the country will stick with its initial approach as it tries to drive case numbers back to zero.""Going hard and early is still the best course of action,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.On Friday, she said it was better to look at an outbreak situation with restrictions put in place early.This was in contrast with locations like Hong Kong and Australia.""Better to assess the situation with restrictions in place,"" Ms Ardern said.Mr Bowtell agreed and commended Ms Ardern's plan.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicHe said coronavirus would never be eradicated but eliminating transmission with strict quarantine and isolation measures was the best way to fight the pandemic.""When a case of coronavirus turns up, probably through problems with quarantine and isolation, you move as swiftly as possible and you clobber those cases,"" he said.""Then you go back to cautious business as usual.""He also cautioned against taking an approach more like those seen in the US or Brazil, where economic concerns have prevailed over public health measures.""That would be a recipe for one of the biggest disasters in human history,"" he said.In Australia, there has been substantial opposition to the elimination strategy from both business and government.The Prime Minister has said that level of restrictions would double the unemployment rate and the strategy itself was risky.New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said eradicating the virus in Australia was unrealistic and powerful business groups have argued trying to completely stamp it out was unachievable and would be too destructive to the economy.Mr Bowtell, however, strongly advocates the kinds of measures seen in New Zealand and thinks Australia should follow their goal of eliminating community transmission.""There seemed to be decisions made by the Federal and Victorian governments that they would not learn from and adopt what was going on next door in New Zealand and even closer to home in Queensland and Western Australia,"" he said.""I don't think the strategies adopted by those two governments have worked out very well.""We would have been much better off to have adopted the New Zealand approach in the first place.""In June, NSW, which had been the worst-affected state in Australia before Victoria's second wave, had three weeks without community transmission, and Mr Bowtell said that was a good target to aim for.That could again be achieved by shifting to stricter lockdowns, like in New Zealand.""It's like extinguishing the embers of a bushfire. It's better than waiting until the flames are 10 metres high,"" Mr Bowtell said.""It is better than dealing with hundreds of new cases a day.""","Australia, COVID-19, Diseases and Disorders, Government and Politics, Health, Nauru, New Zealand, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2020-08-15T19:20:26+00:00

""It was a tough time leaving my partner Colin and my daughter Kate back home at Beaupre Farm, a Boer goat farm, which overlooks the Huon River on a beautiful site,"" she said Ms Bishop's experience of helping during disease outbreaks is extensive.

The cyclone, with wind gusts of up to 285 kilometres per hour near its centre, passed by the south of Tonga this morning (local time).The Tongan Meteorological Service has issued warnings for the Tongatapu and 'Eua island groups with expectations of hurricane-force winds of up to 117kph.There are also warnings of gale force and strong winds for the Ha'apai, Tele-ki-Tonga and Tele-ki-Tokelau island groups and Vava'u, Niuatoputapu and Niuafo'ou islands.The meteorological service said it expected a damaging ocean swell to batter all of Tonga as the storm moves south-east.Tongan National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) has advised people to stay away from coastal areas and avoid sea travel until the storm passes. It is forecast to move out of Tongan waters and downgrade to a category three storm by 7:00pm (local time).In Vanuatu, the devastation is widespread.  Power and water supplies are still down and the majority of homes have been damaged in some way, leaving many homeless.Christina Boelulvanua and her family were among the thousands of people who fled volcanic eruptions on Vanuatu's Ambae island back in 2018.But the tropical cyclone has smashed her new life to pieces.""It's so depressing for me and the family. I ran away from the volcano with my kids thinking 2020 would be safe but then came Cyclone Harold,"" she said.Ms Boelulvanua lives in Banban, a community set up for volcano evacuees in the island of Santo.Nearly everything in Banban has been flattened by Harold's winds. Every house has been damaged and food gardens are wiped out.""Now it's all gone. All the bananas are down, yams are down. So it will take time before we start all over again,"" she said.Like many in Vanuatu, Ms Boelulvanua depends on her garden to feed her family.She told the ABC her family would eat the scraps the cyclone has left them, but she doesn't know what they'll do once it's finished.""Some people who have paid jobs can still survive from buying food from the shop, but [for] others who depend on food crops, I can't see how they can survive,"" she said.Fiji has begun assesses the damage left by Harold, which moved out of the country's waters overnight.Images and vision have emerged showing widespread flooding on the main island Viti Levu.Residents have also reported that roofs were ripped off buildings and roads blocked by fallen trees.  Fiji Red Cross director general Ilisapeci Rokotunidau told the ABC's Pacific Beat program the initial damage from the cyclone was far more severe than anticipated.  ""We didn't predict the amount of saturation there was on land. The floods came up quite quickly and into areas we didn't anticipate,"" Ms Rokotunidau said. Naziah Ali, who lives in the town of Ba — located in the north-west of Viti Levu — told Pacific Beat her town was engulfed. ""The town is flooded, most of the shops that you see open on a Wednesday have been closed and boarded up,"" she said.""I can already envisage how much damage there's going to be to goods and other materials people have in their shops.""She added that she saw widespread crop damage to nearby farms and sugar cane fields. The damage from Harold has made Fiji's management of coronavirus more complex. The country has 15 confirmed cases.""We are doing all of this amid COVID-19 restrictions, so a lot of the [country's] movement has been restricted,"" Ms Rokotunidau said. ""One of the things we have stressed to our volunteers is their own personal safety as they prepare to [help families]."" She said she hoped the Australian Red Cross would donate personal protective equipment (PPE) to Fiji's Red Cross volunteers as they assist in the recovery effort amid COVID-19.The Australian Government has provided the Solomon Islands with more than $99,000 of emergency assistance funds, while New Zealand has also joined Australia in providing more than $480,000 in financial assistance to Vanuatu.A defence jet will leave Australia later today to deliver cyclone relief supplies to Vanuatu. Australia has also confirmed an offer to Fiji of damage surveillance and humanitarian relief supplies.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne told a press conference this morning that officials were ""assessing"" what immediate impact Cyclone Harold was having on Tonga. ""We stand ready to provide what further help we can to our Pacific family in whatever ways we can,"" she said.Australia is working with the Red Cross and other NGOs to provide supplies like tents and water containers in Vanuatu.It is also helping with damage-assessment flights.The ABC has been told the situation is ""grim"" with fears the damage in some places has been as bad as Cyclone Pam, which hit Vanuatu in March 2015, killing at least 15 people and leaving the country with a damage bill of nearly $600 million, more than half of the country's annual GDP.The Australian High Commissioner to Vanuatu was aboard one of the damage-assessment flights and she was joined by the Vanuatu country director for the NGO World Vision, Kendra Gates Derousseau.""Houses were essentially pulled to pieces rather than just wind damage. It was catastrophic,"" Ms Gates told the ABC's Pacific Beat.Ms Gates Derousseau said that eight of her staff ""had lost everything"", including one pregnant staff member who had to run for cover with her family.

With the double-whammy of managing coronavirus mitigation and cyclone recovery, Ms Gates Derousseau said Vanuatu's full recovery would take years, and would need international help. ""Given the COVID-19 crisis, I would anticipate that at least the economy will take many years to start again, particularly because Santo [Island] was a massive tourist destination,"" she said. ""The north of the island is also the big agricultural centre. So there will be significant damages sustained because of the loss of crops and the loss of the ability to both internally and externally export.""[But] the Vanuatu people are proving themselves resilient, [and] they will need international assistance to continue with that journey.""

It has drawn a heated response from the Government's opponents, with Opposition leader Matthew Wale labelling the ban ""pathetic"" and unjust.""Seventy per cent of our population is under the age of 30 … and that is the group that is highly visible on social media, especially Facebook,"" he told the ABC.""This is really pathetic.

""I have been advised by your representative in the Solomon Islands in respect to the potential funding that can be made … my ministry is interested in officially opening dialogue to investigate this proposal further in detail.""A letter dated a few days later on December 4 and signed by Terry Wong replies:""I note receipt of your letter … accepting in principle our brokerage and consultancy charges payable upon successful completion of transfer of 100 billion US dollars.""A letter of offer from Mr Wong says there would be no restrictions on how the loan would be used but suggests infrastructure, healthcare and education among a long list.It doesn't state the loan's interest rate — it's yet ""to be determined"" — but it would be equal to the average national cash deposit rate in the Solomons.The letter says the loan's duration is 20 years, though it is subject to negotiation.Where the $151 billion dollars would come from is not clear.In his letter Mr Wong indicates he heads a consortium of ""consultants, agents and funds managers"" and that he was the ""exclusive authorised broker"" for the loan.In a second letter from Mr Kuma, written just a day after the first, he tells Mr Wong that he accepts his offer of an 11 per cent brokerage fee in principle.In dollar terms the fee would work out to $US11 billion ($16.6 billion). In an email to the ABC, Mr Kuma confirmed his ministry was assessing Mr Wong's proposal.""There are several concessional loan proposals that have been offered on the table from all development partners including China,"" he wrote, adding that several Chinese businesses had offered loans, not just Mr Wong. ""As it would not be proper to go into details, the important matter for the Government is that such a loan has to be assessed under the purview of the Debt Management Framework, and the capacity of the Government to absorb and invest these loans into good use.""The leaked documents also include three proposals about how the money could be used — to invest in either US Treasury Bills, or a Certificate of Deposit, or thirdly, a diversified blue-chip investment portfolio.The interest earned would be used to repay the loan and support the national budget.In his letter, Mr Wong suggests the Solomon Islands should act ""promptly"", because other nations are also applying for the same finances.He goes on to explain the money would be deposited into the Solomon Islands' Central Bank once a letter of guarantee — signed by the Finance Minister and the Prime Minister — is handed over.The documents have set off alarm bells for Denton Rarawa, who was the Governor of the Solomon Islands Central Bank until last year.Aid is an important resource for the Pacific Islands region, but public information is often lacking. The Lowy Institute Pacific Aid Map is designed to enhance aid effectiveness.""Solomon Islands basically is a $US1 billion economy trying to borrow $US100 billion,"" he said.""That is a classic case for entering into a debt trap … I am a bit concerned about the country's ability to repay a huge amount of borrowing.""He's also concerned about the 11 per cent brokerage fee, which he said was ""on the high side"".Peter Kenilorea Jr, a Solomon Islands Opposition MP who used to head up the country's foreign affairs department, said the idea of a $US100 billion loan is a fantasy.""Something like this for me is not serious at all and it doesn't warrant the time of the day to spend over-assessing something as fantastical as a $US100 billion loan,"" he told the ABC.""That in itself is a waste of time, a waste of resources [to] look at assessing this kind of scam.""The ABC spoke with Mr Wong who strongly denied the loan offer was a scam and emphasised his consortium was still considering whether to proceed.The ABC has offered him an interview and has sought comment from the Solomon Islands Prime Minister's Office.","Asia, China, Government and Politics, Pacific, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2020-02-21T08:13:48+00:00

I'm afraid to drive.""Many people on Santo moved into emergency shelters yesterday.Mr Ruddley is bunkered down in his office with his family.He said the strong winds have brought trees down and damaged food crops.""Branches are falling and most of the roads with trees beside them have been blocked by branches,"" he said.""In the islands a lot of thatch houses and banana, manioc, cassava, all those are down.""Vanuatu is already in a state of emergency because of coronavirus, although the country has no confirmed cases.Over the weekend, disaster authorities had to lift bans on public gatherings larger than five, to ensure people made their way to evacuation centres.Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) told people current rules on social distancing will not apply in shelters.NDMO director Abraham Nasak said there was some confusion around the social-gathering rules, but said given the threat posed by the cyclone, people's safety was paramount.""The rules about social gatherings don't apply right now because people need to be moving to safe shelters and evacuation centres to hide from the cyclone,"" he said in a post on social media.Manson Taridenga, a disaster official in the northern province of Penama, said the impact of the cyclone was expected to grow, and that people were on alert. ""I think we are still preparing for the worst since we had another warning this morning,"" Mr Taridenga said. ""TC Harold is moving east, so it is on a line where we are. Really we are still waiting and we are prepared.

""Meanwhile, countries like Solomon Islands and Vanuatu are being hit by Tropical Cyclone Harold — more assistance for the Pacific is required.""So far, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has donated more than $99,000 in immediate emergency funds to the Solomon Islands.Plan International Australia emergency programs coordinator Angellah Anisi told the ABC Australia's contribution to the Solomon Islands was the only known donation to the region so far.

""Large scale dissemination of COVID-19 information is slow and logistics is a huge problem,"" she said. Meanwhile, efforts to help cyclone-affected communities across the Solomons has proven difficult as communications infrastructure and some roads have been taken out, according to Ms Anisi. ""A bridge was damaged on Thursday making access to some of the communities difficult — access is now possible with local villagers clearing away debris to allow trucks to pass through,"" she said. ""Some of these communities do not have mobile coverage, therefore reliable information is hard to come by.""Five bodies were recovered on Sunday during the search for 27 people missing from the MV Taimareho, a ferry struck by heavy seas in waters near the Solomon Islands capital of Honiara.","COVID-19, Cyclone, Cyclones, Disaster Relief, Disasters and Accidents, Diseases and Disorders, Health, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, ",2020-04-06T01:43:51+00:00

Climate change is a real threat.Solomon Islands also has one of the highest rates of family and sexual violence in the world.Two-thirds of women aged 15 to 49 have reported physical or sexual abuse by a partner.Three-quarters of both men and women believe this violence is acceptable, especially if a woman is ""disobedient"".But many extraordinary people I encounter during a visit to the Solomons are trying valiantly to change this.A long and bumpy road that runs the length of Honiara, the ramshackle capital of Solomon Islands, takes me towards a home where I will meet two young activists.My taxi driver Homer used to be a high school history teacher, and says even in school, boys don't treat girls with respect.""They beat them up. They make fun of them and shout when they talk. They steal their pencils. They show no respect for girls,"" he says.The girls I am about to visit, Elima and Elizabeth, graduated from high school last year, and are still working for girls' right to an education.A big barrier is school fees. Parents are usually only willing to pay for boys to attend upper high school, as girls are expected to get married and become part of their in-laws' family.Even if a girl is lucky enough to stay in school, traditional cultural attitudes usually mean long hours of household chores for her before and after school each day.""The boys, they are like a king, while the girls will work all the hours in the day,"" Elima says.""They're doing the laundry by hand and hauling water, collecting wood for the fire, minding younger children. The boys are saying, 'Do this' and 'Do that!'""Both girls laugh as they talk, but the problem is serious. Only 20 per cent of girls complete Year 10 and fewer still finish Year 12.Elima and Elizabeth were part of a group, supported by Plan International Australia, who researched and wrote a report that was given to Prime Minister Scott Morrison when he visited the Solomons.It asked for Australian aid for education to be tied to gender equity.I'm told the response from Australia was polite but insubstantial.Solomon Islands is still a largely subsistence society based on fish, taro and coconuts.But that way of living is becoming increasingly precarious, and more and more people go to Honiara, hoping for a job.Few find one, and rates of unemployment in the capital are staggering. So is the drunkenness and domestic violence.""In the past, in our culture, men made all the decisions and their word was final,"" Homer tells me as we leave Elima's house.""But while men always stood at the front and had the dominant role, they treated women and girls with respect.""How do we teach boys and men to show that respect again?""Back in 1998 ethnic tensions on the main island of Guadalcanal escalated into violence.The RAMSI mission, a multi-national intervention led by Australia, ended the violence in 2003 and remained in the Solomons until 2017.The Australian government spent $2.5 billion along the way, and the Australian Federal Police are still there.According to some of the people I've encountered, by the time RAMSI ended, the Solomons was a different country.Children had spent years out of school, families had been dislocated and traditional cultural behaviour was destabilised.Lavinia Takei is the Safe Families project manager for Oxfam in the country. She travels to remote communities across the hundreds of scattered islands, working on transforming harmful gender attitudes in the Solomons.She is not always welcomed, especially by the men.Some community leaders are completely opposed to NGOs like Oxfam bringing what they see as Western messages and training.And they're not the only ones. Lavinia tells me her own family and friends also think the man's place is as the unquestioned head of the family and that she's wrong to ever challenge this.""I get that all the time! Especially from my husband, my brothers and from my friends! My female friends, surprisingly,"" she says.""I try to be open minded about their perspectives and change things little by little.""She has some success. One male leader who opposed the workshops became a convert, declaring that her message was about protecting women from violence, not undermining men or traditional values.She sometimes sees less success in Honiara, where the ""trauma of hearing gunshots in the night"" lingers.""During the violence I went to the market early one morning and there was a group of people with a bag in front of them,"" she recalls.She hesitates — the memory obviously still raw.""In it was a head — a headless person. It was just his head.""She says many people resort to alcohol to cope.""Women and men are not valuing their traditions. They'd rather go drinking than come together as a community and talk a problem through,"" she says.Further down the narrow road that runs through Honiara, I meet another woman determined to make a change in her community.Loretta Taika is dressed in shorts, sandals and a high-vis vest. She has a shovel in her hand.Around her a group of people work hard to clean the rubbish off a dirt track running down a steep hill into the main road.The track turns into a river of filth when the rain pours down each afternoon.Loretta lives in a settler community — a shanty town made up of people who've come in from other islands looking for work and built homes out of scrap on unoccupied land around the city.They have no running water, no electricity and no garbage collection.That's the problem that Loretta's tackling this month: cleaning the road and trying to organise council garbage collection.She approached aid organisations for the loan of shovels, rakes, machetes and wheelbarrows and mobilised her neighbours to begin cleaning. The main problem was providing the bins.Settlers can't afford to buy them from the council. Loretta has come up with an alternative, now she's waiting to see if the council will empty the bins she's organised or leave the rubbish for the dogs to scatter.When I ask why she does this community work, she becomes quiet.""Five years ago my sister was murdered,"" she says. It left her full of hate and sorrow.""And that makes me strong to build up to address problems in communities.""The only thing that I can do now is I might save someone's life — by giving out awareness to the young ones to see the importance of women, to see the importance of their mother, of their sister, so that they start caring about them.""Working with her brother and her cousin Lester, a well-known local rapper known as Bibao, she goes into communities and runs workshops.""It's what my sister loved to do — art and design. Through that art we teach each other life skills. I try to make them realise what their skills are and that they're important,"" she says.Through tears, she tells me that her sister would be proud of what she is doing.""We are fighting just to make things right. It's so hard. But I just have to live with it because I think this is what I have to do. To make me happy. To save someone's life,"" she says.As I leave Loretta to her work, I come across a long fence covered in vivid graffiti. It says in huge letters: ""EQUAL"".In smaller letters, scattered amid hearts and fruit and random designs it says, ""Hear Her Too"", ""Eliminate Gender Based Violence"", ""Healthy Relationships"" and ""I Choose to Support Him/Her"".It was created by Loretta and her crew, and it's beautiful.I flag down a local bus and ride back to Chester's Resthouse, a hostel run by the Melanesian Brotherhood.As I'm looking out over the scrappy port of Honiara, Brother George comes to warn me not to walk down to the main street after dark.We chat for a while. He tells me how much he loves his home island of Isabel despite the lack of sanitation, running water and electricity.The government could help, he says, but he's not confident that it will. Instead he prays.""I pray that Solomon Islands will be a peaceful country,"" he says.Many of the women I meet in the Solomons are working towards that end.As the champions of schoolgirls, Elima and Elizabeth, say: ""Together we are stronger.""","Australia, Discrimination, Foreign Affairs, Gender Roles, Human Interest, Law, Crime and Justice, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Women, ",2020-04-05T21:30:00+00:00

But others, like Solomon Islands, are having to wait.They're largely relying on the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility commonly known as COVAX, which aims to supply 2 billion doses to developing countries by the end of the year.As the Pacific waits, there are worries low-income countries, which are relying on COVAX, could be sidelined in the rush by wealthier nations wanting to access the limited vaccine supplies.That has prompted World Health Organization Director General Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus to issue these blunt comments on Monday.""COVAX was designed to avoid with hoarding, a chaotic market, an uncoordinated response and continued social and economic disruption,"" he said.""Not only does this 'me-first' approach leave the world's poorest and most vulnerable people at risk. It's also self-defeating.""Ultimately, these actions will only prolong the pandemic and prolong our pain.""There are restrictions needed to contain it and human and economic suffering. Vaccine equity is not just a moral imperative.""The UK-based Economist Intelligence Unit forecast that Pacific countries like Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands may not vaccinate the majority of their populations — more than 60 per cent — until at least 2025.However, Dr Paula Vivili, the Director of Health at the Pacific Community organisation, said the wait might only be a few months.""The COVAX facility had always been, certainly for the Pacific countries, had always been looking at an April rollout, but we say that it's not so clear,"" he said.""Until you have the vaccines on the ground it is a little bit difficult to be certain.""He added vaccine production technology was changing so fast that it was likely Pacific countries would be able to roll out their COVID-19 vaccination campaigns faster.He also thinks the Pacific's young population is a positive factor.But he acknowledges any delay in a mass rollout will also likely delay the reopening of international borders.That could have economic consequences, especially for tourism-dependent countries like Vanuatu and Fiji, which usually welcome hundreds of thousands of tourists, the majority from Australia, each year.""It would certainly be an issue for said countries, because it will be difficult to have travel like we used to know with a limited amount of vaccinations being done,"" Dr Vivili said.Countries such as Solomon Islands will be helped by COVAX but will still have to source the majority of their vaccines through political arrangements or by purchasing from manufacturers.Australia has pledged more than half a billion dollars over three years to support Asian and Pacific countries to immunise their populations.Dr Choudhri said discussions were underway with Australia and China, which had developed two vaccines that were still in stage 3 trials but already being rolled out under an emergency program.But China's COVID-19 vaccine candidates have recorded differing efficacy results, based on analysis from different countries.Chinese company Sinopharm has a vaccine with an efficacy rate of 79.34 per cent. However the United Arab Emirates reported it was 86 per cent last month.Another candidate produced by Chinese company Sinovac recorded an overall efficacy rate of 50.4 per cent from Brazilian authorities.""While we are taking the vaccine from COVAX we are also talking to bilateral partners,"" Dr Choudhri said.""We are also talking to China and they've offered to provide vaccines for our populations.""Our aim is to have the vaccinees that have been approved or have emergency use by WHO.""China has not yet submitted stage 3 trial data for international peer review, unlike the leading Western vaccine candidates.Dr Choudhri said Solomon Islands had been offered its first batch of the Pfizer vaccine, but he could not confirm when it would arrive.The first round of vaccines will allow Solomon Islands to vaccinate 0.2 per cent of its population, which is about 1,700 to 1,800 people.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicThere's movement elsewhere in the region, with Samoa's Prime Minister telling local media they're expecting their first batch of vaccines next month.Papua New Guinea has also just sorted a deal to distribute vaccines following an international tender.","COVID-19, Diseases and Disorders, Health, Health Policy, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vaccines and Immunity, ",2021-01-20T18:56:03+00:00

It led to a massacre of 60 Kwaio people, and the lingering generational trauma created a sense of mistrust and desire for revenge against Westerners.""You were at risk, because it was like going into a war zone because no peace had been declared,"" said Professor Flannery.But through a shared passion for conservation, Australian scientists have helped heal those longstanding wounds through a reconciliation process.""We know that it's only a couple of generations since many lives were lost and a huge amount of hurt happened on all sides of that situation,"" said Dr Rebecca Johnson, director of the Australian Museum Research Institute and newly appointed chief scientist to the Smithsonian museum in Washington.""If we wanted to go to the Solomon Islands and work, we needed to honour and understand that there were hurts of the past that needed to be acknowledged and, that until we did that, we would not be able to work in the country because there was a lot of unrest.""For passionate conservationist and Kwaio leader Tommy Esau, it took some time to convince others in the tribe to trust the scientists and their work.""We have a history from the past [of] outsiders coming in,"" he said. ""So they have different questions: what are they coming to do? Who are they?""After a long period of negotiation and deliberation, the scientists, led by the Kwaio leadership, engaged in a special reconciliation ceremony in July 2018 to enable further conservation efforts and scientific studies on Malaita. ""It's incredibly powerful to think that [in] acknowledging that hurt, an apology really makes a huge difference, even if it seems like it was generations ago,"" said Dr Johnson.Tommy Esau says the respect shown to his people in allowing them to take the lead has led to strong bonds and open communication.""I find this relationship is so unique. It's very special to us and we want it to continue into the future.""Since the reconciliation, the research partnership has flourished as the Kwaio learn how to document their biodiversity using Western scientific methods and work together to preserve habitat under threat from logging and feral animals.It's also led to the first sighting of a Solomons nightjar and the first research publication, where the lead authors are First Nations people in their own language. ""Understanding the scientific part of it — that it's special, it's unique — it's something that is very interesting and it's amazing to us to know that,"" said Mr Esau.But the search for the elusive giant rat last seen nearly 20 years ago which prompted the three-year collaborative project is still ongoing, but Mr Esau remains hopeful after finding evidence of their existence.""This animal is very special to the Kwaio,"" he said.

Foreign nationals who had travelled in China in the last 14 days would be denied entry, he said, citing the need to relieve pressure on authorities.Solomon Islands took their travel restrictions a step further, announcing regulations restricting the entry of any person who has travelled to any countries with confirmed cases of coronavirus, which has now spread to 25 countries and regions —including Australia — with the UK and Russia confirming their first cases.A statement released by the Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet advised that anyone who had visited a country with a confirmed case in the past 14 days ""will not be allowed to enter the country and will be requested to board the return flight or be subject to detention or quarantine"".The statement said that in addition to members of the public, these restrictions also applied to Government Officials and Members of Parliament.""The Government acknowledges the risks associated with the outbreak of diseases as a matter of National Security,"" the statement said.El Salvador and Guatemala also announced blanket restrictions on people who have recently been in China.US carriers Delta, United and American Airlines joined a long list of airlines around the world that have suspended or cut back services to parts of mainland China in response to the spread of coronavirus.The suspensions came after the US State Department issued a level 4 ""Do Not Travel"" advisory — the highest grade of warning — and told Americans in China to consider departing using commercial means.""Travellers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice,"" the advisory said.British Airways has suspended all flights to and from mainland China, while other carriers including Finnair, Vietnam Airlines, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, Korean Air and Singapore-based Jetstar Asia have slashed services.Italy's aviation authority said all flights between China and Italy were suspended until further notice after the country reported its first two cases of the virus.Air India and South Korean budget carrier Seoul Air have also halted all flights to the country, and Indonesia's Lion Air plans to do the same.While the Federal Government's Smart Traveller website has advised Australians to reconsider their need to travel to China, flights are still readily available to and from mainland China.However, Qantas is offering full refunds to passengers who bought tickets to China on or before January 24.ABC/Reuters","Air Transport Industry, China, Disease Control, Diseases and Disorders, Health, Singapore, Solomon Islands, United States, World Politics, ",2020-01-31T23:03:44+00:00

Beijing considers Taiwan a rogue breakaway province — and claims it in its entirety — while the Government of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen advocates for the island's independence.  The South Pacific has been a traditional diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, but following its most recent losses, Taipei now only has Palau, Nauru, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands as allies. Globally, this leaves Taiwan with total of 15 states that recognise the Asian territory's independence, which includes the Vatican, and a number of small states in the Pacific, Caribbean, and Latin America. On Saturday, the Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, signed an agreement with Solomon Islands' Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele to officially established diplomatic ties at a government guest house in Beijing. ""Right now there are only very few countries that have not established diplomatic relations with China,"" Mr Wang told reporters after the signing as Mr Manele stood by his side.""We believe that in those countries there will be more and more people with vision who will step forward and their voice for justice and in line with the trend of history will be heard.""Solomon Islands and Kiribati's respective decisions to break with Taipei have dealt fresh blows to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January. Since Ms Tsai's election, China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan by flying regular bomber patrols around the island. Repeatedly, Taiwan has accused Beijing of offering easy cash, loans and goods in return for recognition — a claim the Chinese Government denies — but this week China said both Kiribati and the Solomon Islands would have ""unprecedented development opportunities"" if they sided with them. In July, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare told the Australian National University's Little Red Podcast that Taiwan was ""completely useless to us"" economically and politically. He went on to say that Beijing could help the island nation ""establish a military force"". Winning over Solomon Islands and Kiribati also strengthens China's influence in the Pacific, where Washington and Canberra have grown increasingly worried about Beijing's increasing clout. Australia's former High Commissioner to the Solomon Islands, James Batley, told ABC's The World program that Honiara's decision was unsurprising and grounded in ""access to resources"". ""Politics in Solomon Islands is essentially about access to resources, and the control of resources, and I think that's ultimately what has motivated this decision,"" he said. The Pacific island nation of Kiribati acted in its best national interest when it severed ties with Taiwan and re-established diplomatic relations with China, the office of Kiribati's President said on Saturday.The office of Kiribati's President Taneti Maamau said in a statement that the re-establishment of diplomatic relations came ""following a long internal review and assessment of our international relations in accordance with the best national interest for our country and people.""Taiwan said on Friday that China lured Kiribati with economic investment. Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Beijing was trying to ""suppress and reduce Taiwan's international presence"".Pacific analyst Tess Newtown-Cain, an adjunct associate professor at Griffith University's Asia Institute, concurred with Mr Wu's sentiment, and told The World that Beijing's efforts were ""very much about compressing the small amount of international space that Taiwan already exercises"". ""Obviously it's very significant in light of the upcoming elections in Taiwan in January,"" she added. Both Kiribati, with a population of around 110,000, and the Solomon Islands lie in strategic waters that have been dominated by the United States and its allies following the Second World War.Aid requested by Kiribati from Beijing includes loans and a Boeing 737 aircraft, said a senior official in Taiwan with direct knowledge of the matter who sought anonymity.ABC/Reuters","China, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, International Aid and Trade, Kiribati, National Security, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Taiwan, Territorial Disputes, World Politics, ",2019-09-21T13:34:32+00:00

Rietveld was initially sentenced to four years and two months but the magistrate reduced this to a three-year sentence, taking into account time already spent in custody, as well as his public service, age and health.Ella Kauhue, president of the National Council of Women, said the sentence was too lenient and a ""slap in the face"".""Such a decision has discouraged a lot of people, especially women,"" Ms Kahue said.

The Solomons Government, which did not immediately respond to questions on Wednesday, has previously said it was a private sector deal and was not privy to the commercial arrangements.Solomons opposition lawmaker Peter Kenilorea said the Gold Ridge agreement was opaque and its terms needed to be better explained.The size of the contract has perplexed mining analysts, given past private operators have struggled to make the mine profitable.Independent Australian-based mining analyst Peter Strachan said the agreement was ""way over the top"" for a relatively low-grade gold project with modest reserves.""There has to be some back story on this,"" said Mr Strachan, who has visited the Guadalcanal mine site.The troubled Gold Ridge mine last operated in 2014, before severe floods halted production.At its peak it was the source of 30 per cent of GDP in the Solomons, which is largely reliant on timber exports. Solomons GDP was at $1.4 billion last year, according to World Bank data, making it one of the world's smallest economies.The project owners have not released an anticipated date the project will restart.Walton Naezon, chairman of the Gold Ridge landowner group, said  the Gold Ridge deal was a commercial arrangement with no political input.He said the project's two other equity owners, Wanguo and AXF Resources, were raising $275 million to pay China Rail to bring the mine back into production.""The balance is the second phase to be approved, which includes things like underground work,"" Mr Naezon said, referring to the remainder of the $825 million contract.""China Rail will bring their own machines. They will employ 70 per cent local labour and the rest will be their own staff.""Reuters","Australia, Business, Economics and Finance, China, Government and Politics, Mining and Metals Industry, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Taiwan, United States, World Politics, ",2019-10-30T05:21:11+00:00

248,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-17/china-bankrolls-solomon-islands-stadium-ahead-of-pacific-summit/11612524,"China has agreed to bankroll a multi-million-dollar stadium in Solomon Islands after the Pacific nation's diplomatic switch to the Asian superpower from Taiwan. The news comes as China plans to send one of its most senior Communist Party officials, Vice-Premier Hu Chunhua, to a summit in the Pacific next week. That visit comes on the heels of what experts say is a diplomatic coup for China — with both Solomon Islands and Kiribati cutting ties with Taiwan last month in a switch to Beijing. Due to the ""one China"" policy, the Chinese Government severs diplomatic ties with nations that recognise Taiwan. Upon his return from a trip to China this week, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare confirmed China would provide a $74 million grant to build a new stadium for 2023 Pacific Games in the capital Honiara.Taiwan had previously committed to funding the sports complex, but the political about-face put the 12,000-seat stadium — and the games themselves — in doubt. Mr Sogavare stressed the funding was a ""grant"" — not a ""loan"" — in a bid to validate the switch to China and quell unease about the diplomatic decision.Pacific neighbour Papua New Guinea has also committed about $17 million to infrastructure for the sporting event, with Indonesia volunteering to fund the football facility and the United Arab Emirates tipped to fund the aquatic centre. Meanwhile, China's Economic Daily yesterday spruiked the upcoming China-Pacific Island Countries Economic Development Co-operation Forum next week.It's the third summit of its kind and will be held in the Samoan capital of Apia, with newly minted Chinese allies Kiribati and Solomon Islands expected to attend. Mr Hu, who typically oversees tourism and is among China's top-25 officials, is expected to deliver a keynote address at the summit on October 20 and 21. In an interview with an unnamed spokesperson from China's Commerce Ministry, the Economic Daily wrote that the relationship between Pacific island and China was ""at its best in history"". It described the forum as ""timely"" and ""a good opportunity to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the Pacific"". The same article described the diplomatic switch was as a ""breakthrough"" after ""years of intensive cultivation"".""Over the years, China has provided selfless help to the island countries within its capabilities and has built a large number of complete sets of projects such as roads, bridges, ports and sports facilities for the island countries,"" the article read. ""China has also helped the people of island countries to improve their livelihood and shake off poverty and become rich.""Australia has ""observer status"" at the upcoming summit in Samoa and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) deputy secretary Ewen McDonald, head of DFAT's office of the Pacific, is expected to attend. The Australian Government has launched the Pacific ""step up"" amid China's rising influence in the region, with $2 billion slated for infrastructure financing.Lowy Institute Pacific program director Jonathan Pryke told the Samoa Observer the upcoming summit was an ""affirmation that the West will have to remain vigilant"". But Ryan Manuel, an academic specialising in China at the University of Hong Kong, said Mr Hu's Pacific visit was less about Australia's relations in the region and more of a victory lap. ""A stadium in return for switching diplomatic recognition and irritating the heck out of the Taiwanese is pretty cheap for China,"" Dr Manuel said. ""Hu Chunhua is applauding the 'wisdom of the Pacific islands' — in the Chinese mind — of switching away from Taiwan to China.""The wind is well and truly in their sails.""Dr Manuel added that ""just because China looms large to us, doesn't mean we loom large to China,"" adding that China's deep pockets meant signing off on millions would be a simple transaction — though that amount would make a huge impact for Pacific islands.Lv Guixia, a professor of Pacific international relations from Liaocheng University, said she expected new infrastructure projects to be announced at the forum in line with the Belt and Road initiative.""China and the Pacific island countries are well suited with each other,"" Dr Lv said, adding that China valued the Pacific's strategic location and natural resources, while many Pacific countries needed funds to fuel development. She said while Australia regarded the Pacific as part of its backyard, relations with its island nations had not been on equal footing.Dr Lv used a Chinese idiom, in which a bird is frighted at the mere sight of an archer's bow, to describe Australia's reaction to China's moves on the Pacific.

""Now I will begin exploring ways to cut off ties with #SolomonIslands including potentially ending financial assistance & restricting access to US dollars and banking,"" he wrote. The office of Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare did not immediately respond to questions.Solomon Islands is the sixth country Taiwan will lose as a diplomatic ally since Ms Tsai came to office in 2016 — following Burkina Faso, the Dominican Republic, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama and El Salvador.Ms Tsai, who's facing an uphill battle in January's vote, has been criticised over her handling of Beijing, which suspects her of pushing for Taiwan's formal independenceIn a strongly-worded statement, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Mr Sogavare and his cabinet made the decision based on a ""highly biased"" report from a government taskforce which had been charged with assessing the diplomatic relationship.""The Government of the Republic of China [Taiwan] finds this decision extremely regrettable and strongly condemns it,"" the statement said.""Prime Minister Sogavare has not only broken his own public promise, but also disregarded the fruits of the 36 years of cooperation between Taiwan and Solomon Islands.""The statement went on to allege China attempted to ""buy off"" officials in Solomon Islands.""[China] has once again resorted to dollar diplomacy and false promises of large amounts of foreign assistance to buy off a small number of politicians, so as to ensure that the Government of Solomon Islands adopted a resolution to terminate relations with Taiwan.""James Batley, a former Australian high commissioner to Solomon Islands, told the ABC's The World program the decision was widely expected.""I don't think any of Solomon Islands' neighbours, and that includes Australia, will really be surprised by this decision,"" he said.""Politics in Solomon Islands is essentially about access to resources, and the control of resources, and I think that's ultimately what has motivated this decision."" Solomons MP Peter Shanel Agovaka told a parliamentary committee earlier this month that after four decades of independence and a long-term alliance with Taiwan, it was time to make a change.""We cannot sit for the next 40 years with our friends Taiwan. It is time that we make new friends — it's time that we should move on with our life,"" Mr Agovaka said, according to a recording obtained by Reuters.""Our new relationship will deal with a One China policy; a One China policy that recognises only Beijing as the official government administration,"" he said.News of the end of diplomatic ties between Solomon Islands and Taiwan comes after a series of blunt assessments of the relationship from Mr Sogavare in recent months.""To be honest, when it comes to economics and politics, Taiwan is completely useless to us,"" Mr Sogavare said in an interview with the Australian National University's Little Red Podcast in July.Beijing could assist the Solomon Islands to ""establish a military force"", he said, something that Taipei was incapable of doing.""In terms of economics and geopolitics, we cannot flex our muscles. So they [Taiwan's Government] are completely useless to us in that sense.""The Pacific remains one of Taiwan's last bastions of diplomatic support, with five nations in the region — Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Tuvalu and Palau — recognising Taipei rather than Beijing.Taiwan donates large amounts of aid to these countries, and works hard to cultivate relationships with their political leaders. But China has been intent on prising off Taiwan's remaining allies, offering loans and other development funds.In addition to perceived financial benefits, many Pacific Island countries feel a relationship with China gives them diplomatic leverage with traditional partners like Australia, given the current geopolitical climate.Chinese officials had been actively courting Solomon Islands' politicians to get rid of Taiwan and sign up to Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, just like its Pacific Island neighbours Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu.Mr Batley said he did not think other countries in the Pacific would necessarily follow suit, however winning over Solomon Islands was a ""big prize"" for China.ABC/Reuters","Asia, China, Foreign Affairs, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Taiwan, World Politics, ",2019-09-16T13:49:26+00:00

But Australia's peacekeeping mission to my home country in 2003 was almost given a very different moniker: SIRAM. This might not mean much to an English speaker, but the moment I saw it, I cringed. I was thinking to myself that for the sake of all involved and for the success of the mission, I must not allow this name — which had already been printed on banners and posters — to reach the shores of Solomon Islands.In 2003, Solomon Islands was on the brink of collapse following five years of ethnic tensions, which saw violence break out between militants on the islands of Guadalcanal and Malaita.The prime minister of Solomon Islands requested international aid, and RAMSI was launched in response — a $2.8 billion Australian-led Pacific Islands Forum operation that lasted 14 years. My reporting on the violence was risky, and it led me to flee my home. I came to Australia in late 2000 where I worked casually with the ABC's Radio Australia, broadcasting to the Pacific. I speak multiple Solomon Islands languages including Pijin, Nggae — my mother tongue — and six other languages.My linguistic experience was one of the reasons I got a call from the Australian Defence Force (ADF) School of Languages.They were looking for someone to help them put together a brief on the causes and effects of the ethnic tensions in Solomon Islands.I went up to Townsville and briefed hundreds of troops, for hours at a time, prior to their deployment. During a lunch break, I was asked to go and look over the logos and posters brought by some senior officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the Defence Department. The first thing I noticed was the name of the Australia-led regional intervention. It was then called SIRAM, the acronym for Solomon Islands Regional Assistance Mission.They wanted to know my opinion. I told the officials that I had strong reservations — to say the least — about sticking with the acronym SIRAM. They looked at each other, and one of them asked, 'why?' I told them that in the Are'are language, which is spoken in one of the largest regions of Malaita Province, as well as a region of Marau on the eastern tip of Guadalcanal, it is a swear word. It's rude and very offensive, I told them, trying to be delicate — but I was adamant the term should be avoided. But, they asked, what does the word mean?I told them that ""sira"" was the ""C"" word. And when you add the ""M"", it becomes the possessive form of the noun, meaning ""your c***"". The look on the officials' faces was a mixture of horror and disbelief — and then, relief. Imagine the initial intervention forces arriving in Honiara, unfurling banners and logos with this expletive as the name of their mission. The whole thing would have been a disaster before it even started. I thought — and I'm sure they were thinking it too — that we had narrowly escaped a potential diplomatic incident and backlash.After it all sunk in, they asked me if I had any suggestion as to what we could call the mission instead. ""What about RAMSI?"" I said. Instead of Solomon Islands Regional Assistance Mission, it became the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands.They agreed, thanked me and left. That was just over a week before deployment on July 24, 2003, and changes had to be made to the logo. On June 30, 2017, RAMSI wrapped up. Through the years I have followed and reported on RAMSI's progress — its challenges and achievements — as a journalist working for the ABC, which this week marked 80 years of international broadcasting.I can't forget that the nation was well on the way to becoming a failed state prior to the intervention some 16 years ago. It was in a state of anarchy with no proper rule of law; it was largely dysfunctional and had corrupted institutions of government, a collapsed economy and people living in fear and insecurity. If you compare the situation then to now, without a shred of doubt RAMSI has been a great success.That's because the government of Solomon Islands worked closely with RAMSI, spurred on by the strong desire among the people of the Pacific nation to restore peace and normalcy.RAMSI saved my country and I am proud to have helped in a small way. Hopefully we have learned from our mistakes and will never need this sort of outside intervention again.A Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesman said the name SIRAM was changed to RAMSI to ""ensure the best chance for success for the mission"".""RAMSI is a prime example of the value and strength of Pacific cooperation,"" the spokesman said","Australia, Community and Society, Defence Forces, Foreign Affairs, Language, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Unrest, Conflict and War, World Politics, ",2019-12-20T18:58:26+00:00
252,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-18/solomon-islands-cuts-ties-with-taiwan-in-favour-of-china/11524118,"Beijing has praised Solomon Islands for severing diplomatic ties with Taiwan earlier this week, saying the decision will bring ""unprecedented opportunities for development"" for the Pacific nation.Some $US500 million ($730 million) has reportedly been promised in financial aid by Beijing, far surpassing the financial support offered by Taiwan — meanwhile, Solomon Islands promised to terminate their relationship with Taiwan before China's National Day on October 1.""China highly commends the decision of the Solomon Islands' government to recognise the one-China principle and sever the so-called 'diplomatic ties' with the Taiwan authorities,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said.""We support the Solomon Islands in making such an important decision as a sovereign and independent country.""We're convinced that the establishment and development of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, the world's second-largest economy with more than 1.4 billion people and a bright future, will surely bring unprecedented development opportunities for the Solomon Islands.""On Monday, after months of discussions and weeks of investigation, the Solomon Islands voted to recognise China after 36 years of being aligned with Taiwan.In response, Taiwan immediately terminated relations, closed its embassy and flew its staff out of the pacific island nation.It's the sixth country to make the switch since 2016 and it leaves Taiwan with just 16 diplomatic allies — recent others being Dominican Republic and Panama.Australia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the ABC that it respected Solomon Islands' autonomy in the decision while adding that it does not take a position on other countries' diplomatic stances.In an exclusive interview with the ABC, the United States' Ambassador to Solomon Islands said it was ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision to ""abandon Taiwan"" while raising concerns that tensions between Taiwan and mainland China could disturb the status quo.""It's served us well, it's served the world well, in development and in peace in the region, so we hope that China doesn't disturb that peace,"" US Ambassador Catherine Ebert-Gray said, while adding that the US would be ""keeping an eye"" on the security situation in the region along with other ""concerned countries"".A planned meeting between US Vice President Mike Pence and Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare of Solomon Islands has also reportedly been canned, while Solomon Islands released a brief statements thanking Taiwan for years of friendship.""All of us have learned we need to be more engaged to help the Pacific through this period,"" Ms Ebert-Gray told the ABC.While the details of the final financial package offered to Solomon Islands by China haven't been officially released, there are reports China has promised $US500 million in ""financial aid"".Taiwanese media recently reported that a special task force who travelled to Beijing last month to meet Foreign Minister Wang Yi promised to complete ""the diplomatic procedure … before October 1"" in exchange for $US500 million in aid, while Beijing state media this week quoted Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu flagging the same figure during an unsuccessful resignation announcement.The October 1 deadline was said to be forwarded by an ""inter-party group"" in the Solomons which advised the Prime Minister to establish diplomatic relations as soon as possible ahead of China's hugely anticipated 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs slammed Beijing this week for resorting to ""dollar diplomacy and false promises"" of large amounts of money to buy off politicians, as Beijing's Foreign Ministry dismissed the accusation during a press briefing saying that ""certain principles cannot be bought with money, neither can trust.""""The remarks by certain individuals in Taiwan fully reveal how they've presumed others' behaviour by their own pattern',"" a spokeswoman said.While several Chinese and Taiwan media outlets cited the $US500 million aid money, Pacific experts say that figure has not been confirmed.The Lowy's Pacific Islands Program director Jonathan Pryke told the ABC neither Solomon Islands nor China have officially confirmed what kind of a package has been agreed on.""But one thing for sure is that Solomon Islands would not be doing this without some significant incentive, and I would not be surprised if there was a significant package attached to it,"" he said.""$US500 million is a lot of money for Solomon Islands, and I don't think it will all happen at once … if that were the amount it would be spread over some amount of time.""I'd imagine quite a lot of it will be packaged into loans — that's China's typical way of providing foreign aid and development assistance throughout the Pacific and the rest of the world.""However, the financial aid that China has promised will likely eclipse what Taiwan has provided in aid to Solomon Islands.According to data from the Lowy Institute, Taiwan spent about $US105 million in Solomon Islands between 2011 and 2017, compared to $US1.15 billion provided by Australia.Mr Pryke said he expected China would be providing support to Solomon Islands' Constituency Development Funds, which are direct payments to individual MPs.""That was a major way in which Taiwan supported Solomon Islands through their foreign aid program,"" he said.""I think at a minimum, Solomon Islands' MPs would be expecting that this support would continue because it's quite a lucrative measure of support.""Solomon Islands is the sixth country to cut ties with Taiwan since 2016, leaving Taiwan with formal relations with just 16 countries worldwide including five in the Pacific — the recent severing of Taiwan ties has raised rebate of a domino effect in the region.""Even if China buys all 16 countries with money, it doesn't matter,"" Chui Liang Chiou, a former adviser to the Taiwan president's office, told the ABC.""To some extent, Taiwan's relations with the United States, Japan and Australia are probably even closer than China's relations with these countries, except there is no political diplomatic relations.""Aid is an important resource for the Pacific Islands region, but public information is often lacking. The Lowy Institute Pacific Aid Map is designed to enhance aid effectiveness.He added many Taiwanese may even be happy about the break because it was a huge cost to maintain relations with Solomon Islands and those resources can now be focussed on domestic issues like security and social welfare.National Taiwan University political scientist Shimin Chen said while there was no denying or competing with Beijing's great political and economic influence in the world, snatching up all Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies could backfire.""If Taiwan's diplomatic relations reach single digits or even zero, it represents that the international community does not recognise Republic of China, and the result may not be what Beijing wants,"" he told the ABC.""Taiwan may give up the 'Republic of China' name and the Constitution of the Republic of China, and then what will happen? A 'Republic of Taiwan' or some other name? Probably not what Beijing wants to get.""Regional analyst and defence expert Jian Zhang told the ABC China's growing influence in the region could be a concern considering the continuous enhancement of China's military strength and the growth of its long-range missile launch capability.""Strategically, China will regard the South Pacific as a more important region,"" he said.Mr Zhang noted that the first country Mr Morrison visited was Solomon Islands, ""which reflects the potential worries about the establishment of diplomatic relations between Solomon Islands and China"".""Solomon Islands still established diplomatic relations with China even though both Australia and the United States have strengthened their influence on the South Pacific island countries.""So, this is an obvious diplomatic setback and even a failure for Australia and the United States.""The ABC contacted China and Taiwan's ministries of foreign affairs for comment, but they did not respond by publication time.Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has also been contacted for a response.","Asia, China, Foreign Affairs, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Taiwan, World Politics, ",2019-09-18T09:56:17+00:00

We're very humble and thankful for that,"" she said.Ms Howell said teams had sacrificed a lot to be involved in the competition and were honoured to be there.""It's really expensive to travel and back home, as a developing country, you don't have access to a good amount of money,"" she explained.""Most of us are students [and] some of them have sacrificed so much time and effort.""They have pulled out money out of their own pockets to be here and that's because they love hockey and they really want to grow in our game and sport.""Hockey Fives is a short format game of the sport, played by a team of five on a smaller field.It was created by the International Hockey Federation to give players from developing countries — who may not have a full-sized field or enough players — the opportunity to compete in major tournaments.""They only have to bring nine players not 18 [and] even with that, largely they can only afford to go to one hockey tournament a year,"" Oceania Hockey Cup secretary Bob Claxton said.Mr Claxton said the introduction of Hockey Fives had helped more countries take up the sport and compete in higher level tournaments.""They [the Solomon Islands] have now got 2,000-plus players where two or three years ago hockey was very very small,"" he said.The Australian and New Zealand men's and women's teams are also competing at the Oceania Hockey Cup in Rockhampton where they are fighting for a direct qualification to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.Ms Howells said watching the level of skill on the field between those players was motivating her and her team.""They're like role models to us; we have no words for how amazing it was watching them,"" she said.""If we work hard and we try to improve and get better we can be just as good as them, so it's really motivating and inspiring.""Ms Howells said she would love to see tougher competition in her country but it was difficult to attract players due to a lack of facilities and equipment.

It is time that we make new friends — it's time that we should move on with our life,"" Mr Agovaka said, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by Reuters.""Our new relationship will deal with a One China policy; a One China policy that recognises only Beijing as the official government administration,"" he said. Mr Agovaka is a senior minister and leader of a government team convened recently to speak directly with Beijing.However, he is not a part of the Government task force in charge of reporting on the issue of whether the nation should formally decide to switch to Beijing.The task force is dominated by MPs who support a diplomatic change, two political sources with direct knowledge of the issue told Reuters.China and Taiwan have fought a tug-of-war for diplomatic recognition in the South Pacific for decades, with some island nations switching allegiances for financial gain.The Solomons — the largest of the Pacific's Taiwan-aligned states — has recognised Taiwan since 1983. The South Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, with the region making up a third of its total alliances. But its alliances have dissipated in recent years, with El Salvador, Burkina Faso, and the Dominican Republic all switching over to China last year.Taiwan said it is watching developments in the Solomons.""Relationship with Solomon Islands currently is stable, but we are closely monitoring the situation and development,"" Joanne Ou, a spokeswoman for Taiwan's foreign ministry, said. Commenting during a regular daily news conference in Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China was willing to have relations with all countries on the basis of the ""one China"" principle. The Solomon Islands Government has been assessing its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan since new Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare took control after a general election in April. He has begun looking for ways to improve the country's economic prospects, which currently relies on timber exports to generate income.China is offering to bankroll a development fund for the Solomons to help with a transition away from Taiwan, which currently provides an annual $12.5 million contribution to the island nation.But 16 Solomons MPs have cited potential ""compromised freedoms"" as a reason against the switch in an open letter last month, while an observer at the task force hearings told Reuters there would be push-back against a switch. Presently it remains unclear if there are options to block the Government's mooted move. ""The government is trying to make a relationship with China now, but to formalise it we need to wait for the report,"" the observer said.The Lowy Institute said in a report last month that Canberra and Washington are concerned about the Solomons switching recognition to Beijing.""A switch by any one [of the states that recognise Taiwan] may stimulate others"" to abandon Taipei, the institute said.

256,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-01/china-on-the-table-in-scott-morrisons-trip-to-solomon-islands/11162326,"There's an old saying in Honiara, Solomon Islands' capital: ""You can tell a drunk-driver from a mile away … they drive straight"".Kukum Highway, the capital's main road, was once so littered with potholes — so the saying goes — that local police just targeted cars driving straight over them, rather than carefully around.      But that old joke doesn't have the same ring to it these days.When Prime Minister Scott Morrison is driven down Kukum Highway after touching down in Honiara on Sunday — for what is the first visit of an Australian prime minister since Kevin Rudd in 2008 — he'll feel only a few incidental bumps.The Kukum Highway just got a makeover — and a couple of brand-spanking new bridges to boot.        But this project is a little different from most sparkling new infrastructure in the Pacific.  The Kukum Highway upgrade was funded and built by Japan.In fact, along the way into town Mr Morrison will drive past specialist wings at the local hospital funded by Taiwan.  He'll pass the multipurpose indoor stadium which New Zealand is planning to upgrade.  And he'll look over the famous Iron Bottom Sound, the site where the new Australian-funded and politically potent $137 million Sydney to Honiara subsea internet cable is set to land.One big political powerhouse in the region is missing from the list: China. Solomon Islands is one of six Pacific Island countries — and by far the biggest — that holds diplomatic links with Taiwan, not its big brother and neighbour to the west.And it is a fact is not lost on Beijing. Chinese officials have been actively courting Solomon Islands' politicians to get rid of Taiwan and sign up to Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative, just like its Pacific Island neighbours Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu. The Chinese Ambassador for Fiji Qian Bo even told journalists in Suva this month Solomon Islands can be turned for the better ""overnight"" if that were to happen.        So it is no surprise that this potent geo-political situation has framed Mr Morrison's visit, with some commentators pitching it as a lobbying effort to convince newly crowned Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare to stick with Taiwan.Mr Sogavare, now in his fourth separate stint as Prime Minister after being controversially re-elected last month, has said publicly he is reviewing the Taiwanese relationship.It creates a minefield of ""what ifs"" for the region, as Chinese influence grows.                 But in reality, Mr Morrison's visit means more — much more.   ""It's not all about China,"" Lowy Institute Pacific Islands program director Jonathan Pryke told the ABC this week.""Obviously the geo-political situation frames an element of this visit. ""But is incredibly significant and, in fact, historic, that the first overseas trip by an Australian Prime Minister post-election is to the Pacific.  ""It's not a tokenistic effort. It's more than that.""Mr Pryke said, in reality, Mr Morrison would have likely visited Papua New Guinea on the way to London for D-Day commemorations before travelling to Singapore and the G20 summit in Osaka.  But the political turmoil that had engulfed PNG this week most likely halted those plans.  In a statement this week, Mr Morrison said the Pacific was ""front and centre"" of Australia's strategic outlook and the trip would show the Pacific Step-Up program — announced in 2017 — ""in action"".   He will be accompanied by Alex Hawke, newly-minted Minister for International Development and the Pacific. On the ground in Honiara, finding someone aware of ""Step Up"" would be a tough ask.  Locals who spoke to the ABC said Mr Morrison's impending visit only created a minor ripple, particularly as it was framed around the China-Taiwan conflict.Other more politically savvy locals questioned his climate change policies in a country where islands are, quite literally, disappearing from the map.     Some said they hoped the visit would convince local politicians to stop ""dancing with the dragon"" and focus instead on lobbying Australia to continue its support of development issues such as health, youth unemployment and governance.       But Australia's relationship with Solomon Islands, both historically and today, extends well beyond today's Pacific tug-of-war with China.  Next month marks two years since the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) left the country after its $2.8 billion, 14-year mission to restore peace after the civil conflict known as ""the tensions"" kicked off in 1998. Australia is by far the biggest aid donor to the country, pumping in an estimated $198.3 million in 2018-19.That includes funding for almost 100 skills-based volunteers in areas such as health, law and education through the Australian Volunteers International program — a program I was lucky enough to be a part of in Honiara in 2017.   Australia's role in RAMSI is a legacy that is remembered by all Solomon Islanders, and will be into the future. So much so there are many now-teenage boys — and even some girls — named Ramsi in tribute to the peacekeeping force.The April riots in the capital following the country's general elections did contribute to some diplomatic nervousness locally. But the local police's response — and peace since the April event — was seen as a signal of its maturity. The country is a critical partner for Australia in the region, and one that is facing many development challenges ahead.It is why Mr Morrison's trip, as Mr Pryke has suggested, means more than just ""China"".According to Mr Pryke, the best thing Scott Morrison could do during his meeting with Mr Sogavare is sit and listen.""And I hope that's what he does,"" he said.""This is a part of the world where we want to be a leader, to lead positively and genuinely.""Here's hoping there's no diplomatic potholes on the road ahead.

Mr Morrison met his Solomon Islands counterpart Manasseh Sogavare in Honiara this morning on his first trip overseas since winning the election. Solomon Islands is one of six Pacific nations which recognise Taiwan, and the United States has signalled it would like Australia to use its influence in the region to make sure none of them switch allegiance to Beijing. Last month, a senior US state department official visiting Canberra accused China of destabilising the Pacific by trying to poach Taiwan's remaining allies.  There has been feverish speculation in Honiara about whether Mr Morrison would press Mr Sogavare on the topic.Mr Morrison did not say if they discussed the topic but told journalists that Australia would not exert any pressure on Solomon Islands over China. ""Decisions on those issues are entirely the province of the Government of Solomon Islands,"" he said. ""They are an independent sovereign country who will make decisions in their national interests.""It is not our place to provide advice or guidance on those decisions.""Mr Morrison also sought to distance Australia from the broader regional contest between the United States and China, and denied that the Coalition's Pacific step-up was driven by strategic anxiety. ""[The US] have their interests in the region, as do others,"" he said.""Our relationship with the Solomon Islands, our relationship with the Pacific transcends all of that.""There is a great risk and a great danger in an analysis that only can see the world through such a binary prism. I certainly don't. Australia certainly doesn't.""He sought to subtly assert Australia's autonomy from the US in the Pacific, saying ""Indo Pacific states"" like Australia had to ""maintain a very keen focus on their perspectives and insights into the world.""Mr Morrison also praised a recent speech by Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who pleaded with the US and China not to force smaller states to ""pick sides"" as they competed with one another.Mr Morrison has made the Pacific step-up a centrepiece of his foreign policy, and declared yesterday he was sending a ""clear message"" by making Solomon Islands his first overseas destination since regaining power. Mr Sogavare opened his meeting with Mr Morrison by declaring that Australia was one of his nation's oldest and deepest friends. ""This is a peaceful corner of the world and I think it's in our joint interest to continue to protect the freedom and peace that we continue to enjoy in this country,"" he said. The Solomon Islands Prime Minister also lavished praise on Australia, saying it had ""lifted this country up from what would have a been a disaster"" by staging the RAMSI intervention in the wake of the 2003 riots. Mr Morrison made a brace of promises on this visit, including a pledge to redirect $250 million from the foreign aid budget to infrastructure projects in Solomon Islands. But some politicians in Solomon Islands are still pressing Australia to do more to fight climate change. Former Solomon Islands prime minister Rick Hou and prominent MP Peter Kenilorea both said yesterday that Australia needed to show greater ambition in the fight against climate change by cutting carbon emissions. Today Mr Morrison was repeatedly asked what he believed was the greatest threat to the Pacific.The question was a clear reference to the Boe Declaration signed by Pacific Islands last year, which says that climate change is the preeminent security threat to the region.Mr Morrison responded by arguing that civil stability was the greatest security concern for Solomon Islands, before simply saying that Australia's views on security were laid out in the Defence White Paper.

He was arrested on June 24.The alleged offences happened between 2010-2012 when Mr Rietveld was the head of the Supporting Work in Ministry (SWIM) — part of the Christian Reformed Churches of Australia — on the outskirts of Honiara.The alleged victims were sponsored by the mission.Police said investigations began when complaints were made following Mr Rietveld's departure in 2012. ""Following thorough and comprehensive investigations and negotiations and extensive inquiries we carried though our law colleagues in Australia, it was eventually negotiated that the man return to Honiara on June 23 this year,"" Police Commissioner Mathew Varley said.Mr Rietveld's trial has been set for February 2020. He is currently on bail and has been barred from travelling to eastern Honiara where SWIM is located.The case has shocked locals, with Mr Rietveld, who once wrote a regular column on Christianity in the national newspaper, the Solomon Star, well known in the community. Yet Solomon Islands social workers have highlighted the need for greater awareness about services for young children affected by sexual violence.Anika Kingmele, the chair of Family Support Centre, a Solomon Islands non-government organisation helping those affected by domestic and family violence, said while there were systems in place to support children affected by sexual violence, raising awareness was hard given ""cultural norms"".She added the Government needed to play a stronger role in providing support to young children who may be victims of sexual violence.","Child Abuse, Crime Prevention, International Law, Law, Crime and Justice, Pacific, Sexual Offences, Solomon Islands, ",2019-08-14T05:44:46+00:00

The High Court ordered the contest for the position should be postponed, but Governor-General Sir Frank Kabui used constitutional powers to press ahead with the vote.Mr Wale and about 15 supporters responded by walking out.In the end only 35 ballots were cast, with all but one of them in favour of Mr Sogavare.Not long after that protests broke out in parts of Honiara, with a small group of young men marching to Parliament House and calling for Mr Sogavare to step down.Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) Commissioner Matthew Varley said in a video statement posted to Facebook he had ordered ""a large number"" of roadblocks and checkpoints to be put in place across the city.Mr Varley said he had directed police, including the riot squad, to ""take stern and swift action"" against anyone found to be participating in ""illegal activities"".Commissioner Varley also appealed for people to accept the election outcome, and vowed that police would step up patrols of Honiara overnight to guard against unrest. ""I urge all law-abiding citizens to stay at home tonight and stay off the streets. Please stay home with your families tonight and allow the police to maintain law and order in our capital city,"" he said.Videos posted to social media showed large crowds of young men walking through the streets near China Town while yelling slogans and throwing objects. Large numbers of police turned them back from the area, which was the site of violent riots back in 2006.Meanwhile, police have reportedly used tear gas to disperse crowds in Kukum, in Honiara's west.The Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation also reported that rioters had trashed the Pacific Casino Hotel, posting pictures which showed smashed windows, as well as computers and other equipment strewn all over the ground.Police said numerous vehicles were also damaged.One Australian Government source told the ABC officials from DFAT were closely monitoring events in Honiara.Australia played a major supporting role in ensuring the election went smoothly when voters went to the poll earlier this month.The election was the first since the Australian-led 14-year-long security mission known as Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) came to an end in 2017.The operation brought stability to the country after years of ethnic violence, and Australian officials are hoping the current unrest in Honiara subsides quickly. Mr Sogavare is a familiar face who is used to the mercurial uncertainties of Solomon Island politics.He has already won the top job three times before in 2000, 2006 and 2014, and has been ousted from the position twice.In 2017 MPs used a vote of no confidence to remove Mr Sogavare after he tried to push through new rules to fight corruption.Mr Sogavare's experience is not unusual in the Solomon Islands. Governing coalitions in the country are notoriously fragile, and it is rare for a PM to ever serve a full term.Australian National University researcher Terence Wood said Mr Sogavare's victory demonstrated his political resilience and agility.""Solomon Islands politics is very fluid, and as an experienced power player he's been able to overcome setbacks"" Mr Wood said.Mr Sogavare used his first speech to say God had delivered him victory and promise to get down to work quickly.""The Government will go straight into allocating our various portfolios and get straight into the business of running the affairs of the state,"" he said.","Government and Politics, Politics and Government, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2019-04-24T06:18:13+00:00
263,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-22/solomon-islands-ministers-warn-against-switch-to-beijing/11438528,"A cohort of 16 Solomon Islands MPs have issued a strong warning against the Pacific nation moving its diplomatic relations from Taiwan to Beijing, voicing concern over the ""compromised freedoms"" a political allegiance to China could usher in.The parliamentarians' open letter was published on Tuesday on the Facebook page of the Solomons Business Magazine. It comes as a special taskforce — set up by Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare to investigate the pros and cons of ditching its 36-year relationship with Taiwan — travelled to Beijing this week on a ""fact-finding mission"".The taskforce has also visited Papua New Guinea and other Pacific nations over the past few months to see firsthand the impact of Chinese aid and development assistance.The Solomon Islands is among 17 countries that still maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan and not Beijing, but after coming into power earlier this year, Mr Sogavare said he was open to the idea of making the switch, setting up the bipartisan taskforce helmed by Minister John Moffat Fugui in late June.But in the open letter, some of the country's most senior cabinet ministers such as Foreign Minister Jeremaiah Manele and the former prime minister Rick Hou said they would not back a pivot to Beijing and what they call its ""Marxist"" ideologies. ""We state very clearly that we will not support any policy to change Solomon Islands diplomatic ties from Taiwan to the People's Republic of China (PRC),"" the letter said. ""We believe the long-term interests of our country — in terms of our development aspirations, as well as respect for democratic principles, human rights, rule of law, human dignity, and mutual respect — lie with Taiwan, not the PRC.""The ministers also expressed concern over Solomon Islands being caught in a crossfire from the current trade war between China and the US.""We are aware some people are easily lured by the current glitters of [the] PRC's economic power.""We note that 'not all that glitters is gold!'""""We are aware of important lessons from many countries — including in our region — who are locked in a serious debt trap as a result of their giving in to China's lures. We are aware of examples of governments which have compromised their religious freedoms, surrendered their land rights, compromised the rule of law, and even their people's cultural heritage, as a result of succumbing to the infiltrations of these ideologies in their societies,"" it said.But Solomon Islands Opposition Leader Matthew Wale lashed out at the ministers' letter, accusing them of ""insincere politics"".""It is clear... that the Prime Minister has been pro-Taiwan from right the beginning,"" he said.Sharing the concerns the ministers listed in their letter, Ruth Liloqula from the corruption watchdog Transparency International Solomon Islands pointed to the ""problems"" other Pacific nations that had strong diplomatic ties with China were having, such as the ""erosion of democratic principles"".""Nothing is done in a transparent manner...We know that only a few people will benefit and these are mostly going to be members of parliament as well as their spin doctors,"" she said.The letter also noted that Taiwan was one of the Solomon Islands' most trustworthy allies and a ""genuine friend"", referring to the Taiwanese embassy remained in the capital Honiara through the so-called tensions and ethnic violence of the late 1990s — the only foreign embassy to do so.One of the main planks of Taiwan's aid to the Solomon Islands comes in the form of constituency development funds — money given to individual MPs to use as they see fit.Anti-corruption groups have criticised the payments, calling them slush funds that are used to garner electoral support and not promote development.As the head of the taskforce, Mr Moffat Furgui previously said the issue was not as simple as China versus Taiwan and that there could be a middle ground found.However, according to Pacific expert Tess Newton Caine, who has worked for the United Nations and World Bank in the region, the Solomon Islands ""can't have its cake and eat it too"".She said that if Solomon Islands were to seek change, it would significantly affect the current, ""extensive"" developments assistance Taiwan provided, which was ""very prominent in the spaces of agriculture and health"".""I've heard Taiwanese officials say… that [the aid] would be withdrawn overnight,"" she said.The MPs behind the open letter want the taskforce's review broadened to look at all of the country's diplomatic relations.China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to state-to-state ties, and one that will eventually be part of the PRC again.However many Taiwanese want a separate nation, and the dispute has left a constant threat of violence hanging in the air.Last month China announced fresh restrictions on individual tourism to Taiwan to put pressure on the island.The Solomon Islands is among 17 nations to recognise Taiwan —  just half the number that did in the 1990s. Since 2016, China has poached five of Taiwan's diplomatic allies.Adam Ni, a China researcher at Macquarie University said poaching a diplomatic ally such as Solomon Islands from Taiwan would be a win for Beijing's wider foreign policy and its cross-straight relations with Taiwan.""We've been seeing Beijing really put the pressure on Taiwan on a number of different fronts, using economic leverages such as the the banning of independent travellers to Taiwan and messages of the potential consequences if Taiwan continues to resist talks of 'reunification' with China,"" Mr Ni said.""It's akin to Taiwan living in a room and the room is getting smaller and smaller, harder to breathe and harder to live the way they've been living, with the confines getting tighter and tighter.""Should it switch its diplomatic allegiance, the Solomons — currently Taiwan's biggest ally in the Pacific — would be a prized ally for Beijing as it ramps up its influence in the Pacific.China has been steadily growing its footprint in the region, with governments there sinking into billions of dollars of debt as they sign on to projects linked to Chinese President Xi Jinping's infamous Belt and Road initiative.Dr Newton Caine said there were strong indications that pressure was mounting for Mr Sogavare to take advantage of the infrastructure support that initiative could bring to the Solomons.Earlier this week, Beijing suggested Australia reflect on how it engages its Pacific neighbours after Fiji's Prime Minister accused Scott Morrison of being ""insulting and condescending"" at last week's Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) in Tuvalu.In June, Mr Morrison pressed ahead with the Australian Government's ambitious Pacific step up, reshaping Australia's aid program in Solomon Islands by pledging $250 million for infrastructure during a lightning quick visit to Honiara.The US, meanwhile, has urged Pacific nations with ties to Taipei to maintain the status quo.But if it came down to a bidding war, experts said it would be difficult for many nations to compete with the economic might of China.""It's a question of not if, but when.""","Asia, China, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, Solomon Islands, Taiwan, World Politics, ",2019-08-22T07:10:23+00:00

Police reported election day was a calm and peaceful one, with the electoral commission expected to make their first observations at 7:00pm.A number of voters who the ABC spoke to said they felt reassured by the security presence and did not expect any trouble today.""I'm happy, today I was swimming in my river, I saw the helicopter flying round,"" George Vari said.""Our area has experienced trouble before, but I'm not panicked about it.""Pressley John said he did not believe there would be any disruptions.""For me, I don't think anything will happen in town, I think we have safety in town, we wont have any problems,"" he said.Election official Jude Devesi, who oversees voting in the capital, said there were more than 40,000 registered voters across the city's three constituencies, and he expected a high turnout.""Despite the movement of people going back to their home province to vote in their home constituencies, we have seen a number of people moving from rural areas to the constituency. We expect the numbers to be still quite large.""It is the nation's first poll since the Australian-led, 14-year security mission known as RAMSI —the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands — ended in 2017, a mission that helped bring peace and stability to the country after years of ethnic tensions and killings.Australia remains Solomon Islands' biggest aid donor, dishing up $187 million this financial year, and alongside New Zealand is providing 200 defence force personnel, several helicopters, and navy ships to provide support during voting.Personnel have spent the last few days delivering ballot boxes to remote communities.The country's Police Commissioner Matthew Varley said he was confident voting would be safe, but he warned against anyone attempting to disrupt the process.""I've heard reports that some candidates may blockade access to polling stations in the country in some locations,"" he said.""Whether that's true I can't tell you, the police will be paying close attention to that and we will be dealing with it swiftly.""Authorities are attempting to crack down on questionable campaigning — the night before the poll is known as ""Devil's Night"" in Solomon Islands.Candidates and their agents have quite openly in the past given out cash and other gifts like food as they try to shore up last-minute votes.""Sadly vote buying on Devil's Night has now become a common aspect of elections in the country that people speak openly about it without remorse,"" anti-corruption group Transparency Solomon Islands said in a statement last week.Commissioner Varley said the point of the Australian and New Zealand presence on the ground was to ensure that vote buying did not occur.""My question is 'how much is your vote worth, how much is your voice worth?'"" he said.""Because this is what a person's vote is — the right to choose a leader. If we're going to sell our vote for $200 or a bag of rice ... I think we can do better than that.""The poll takes place amid a Pacific geopolitical struggle between China and the US and its allies — including Australia — and there's another diplomatic tug of war at play too.With a population of approximately 600,000 people, Solomon Islands is Taiwan's largest ally in the Pacific, but China's growing influence in the region and the looming election has put its relationship in the spotlight — China considers Taiwan to be a rogue breakaway province.But Taipei has been a close friend to Solomon Islands, providing substantial aid assistance, including about $30 million in funds that are paid directly to members of Parliament for the sole purpose of developing their rural constituencies.Still, there have been rumblings that Honiara could switch its allegiance to Beijing after the election, particularly given the nation has strong economic ties with China, which is Solomon Islands' largest export market.Those rumours have been denied by leading political parties that the ABC has spoken to, but a review is on the cards for the party of caretaker Prime Minister Rick Hou.","Government and Politics, Pacific, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2019-04-02T22:59:06+00:00

""This is to reaffirm our commitment to the Pacific Step Up program, to our Pacific family,"" he said. The new Solomon Islands infrastructure fund will be spent over 10 years, and is on top of the $2 billion Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific.It's designed for smaller infrastructure projects that Solomon Islands might not want to fund by borrowing from the Facility.Mr Morrison's visit also comes while Solomon Islands is embroiled in a fierce domestic debate over its allegiance with Taiwan.Solomon Islands is one of a dwindling band of countries that recognises Taipei instead of Beijing.Some lawmakers have been pressing Mr Sogavare to abandon Taiwan and establish diplomatic relations with China instead.But Mr Sogavare's predecessor as Prime Minister, Rick Hou, has warned against Solomon Islands making the switch.""It is in the long-term interests of Solomon Islands to maintain the status quo,"" said Mr Hou.""Where China has invested in some of these countries the investment actually is not an investment which is free, you end up with these countries with a whole lot of debt.""The US has made it clear that it would like Australia to urge Solomon Islands to retain the status quo, but Scott Morrison is expected to tread carefully on the subject when he meets Mr Sogavare.Aid is an important resource for the Pacific Islands region, but public information is often lacking. The Lowy Institute Pacific Aid Map is designed to enhance aid effectiveness.Australian anxiety about China's strategic ambitions was also on display at the Shangri-La dialogue in Singapore on the weekend.When asked about the prospect of a Chinese military base in the Pacific, the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Frances Adamson, echoed warnings made by former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.""Any foreign base in our region would not be welcome,"" she said.""It would have an obvious negative impact on Australia's strategic situation.""But Ms Adamson insisted that Australia ""does not see [the Pacific] through the narrow lens of strategic competition"" and was focussed on dealing with tackling infrastructure and development challenges in the region.Mr Hou said he thought the Pacific Step Up was driven by both anxiety about China's rise as well as Canberra's genuine determination to tackle development changes in the Pacific.""It's probably both. The Chinese influence in the region is really huge, and it is growing,"" he said.""Australia does need to be more engaged with its immediate neighbours and Solomon Islands is a really important partner in these engagements."" Mr Hou also said that Pacific leaders remained dissatisfied with Australia's policies on climate change, and wanted Australia to be ""better engaged"" with the environmental challenges it poses.","Asia, Australia, China, Construction and Real Estate Industry, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Taiwan, Urban Development and Planning, World Politics, ",2019-06-02T14:28:52+00:00

Only 25 women are contesting this year's poll.Voting will largely take place on just the one day, and on remote islands, making for a logistical challenge.The estimated population in Honiara is about 100,000, but it's expected to be severely depleted over the next week.The city developed as the Solomons' capital after World War II, and workers were brought in from other provinces at that time, but even though subsequent generations may have lived there from birth, many still don't regard Honiara as home.Former city councillor Jim Sevesi is among the voters making the trip to his village — in Rennell and Bellona province — to vote.""I need to have some connectivity with my land,"" he said.""Once you get stranded somewhere, you need to go back to your roots.""Another voter, Janet, is heading home to support the local member who she said had helped the people.""We have houses, [he has] helped old people, people have engines, main roads, trucks, he's the one who helped [the] people.

I've just come into the post, this is my 12th week, but at this stage we cannot do anything, unless there's an amendment to the act or the regulation, to include pre-polling for health workers,"" Ms O'Neil said.To add to the general confusion the country's electoral commission has warned election candidates not to charter ships themselves and expect their passengers to vote for them, because such a practice has been outlawed.But as is often the case with the drama of a Solomon Islands election, the law is not clear on whether third parties or friends can hire ships on candidates' behalf. Final election results won't be known for several weeks, as ballot boxes are transferred back from remote polling stations to the closest provincial centre.But while voters in Solomon Islands wait for the official announcement, winning candidates will be lobbying and building coalitions to form the next Government.","Elections, Government and Politics, Pacific, Solomon Islands, ",2019-04-01T19:17:46+00:00

This Wednesday marks the small Pacific Island nation's first poll since the Australian-led, 14-year security mission known as RAMSI —Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands — ended in 2017, which helped bring peace and stability to the country after years of ethnic tensions and killings.The mission cost Australia around $2.6 billion of taxpayers money, which has been described by experts as a ""costly and disproportionate investment"".Australia remains Solomon Islands' biggest aid donor, dishing up $187 million this financial year, and providing some 200 defence force personnel for the upcoming election.However, the poll takes place amid a Pacific geopolitical struggle between China and US and its allies — including Australia — and there's another diplomatic tug of war at play too.With a population of approximately 600,000 people, Solomon Islands is Taiwan's largest ally in the Pacific, but China's growing influence in the region and the looming election has put its relationship in the spotlight — China considers Taiwan to be a rogue breakaway province.But Taipei has been a close friend to Solomon Islands, providing substantial aid assistance, including around $30 million in funds that are paid directly to members of Parliament for the sole purpose of developing their rural constituencies. Still, there have been rumblings that Honiara could switch its allegiance to Beijing after the election, particularly the nation has strong economic ties with China, which is Solomon Islands' largest export market.Those rumours have been denied by leading political parties that the ABC has spoken to, but a review is on the cards for the party of caretaker Prime Minister Rick Hou.""In order to satisfy everyone, we said that we'd have a review of that particular relationship with Taiwan [but] that doesn't mean we'll break our relationship with Taiwan,"" President of the Democratic Alliance Party, John Usuramo, told Pacific Beat.But he admitted that it is something of an open secret that there's been lobbying behind the scenes for a switch to China. ""We know that a number of political parties have had dialogue with certain individuals that have come here to Solomon Islands."" The ABC has recently reported that Beijing had also been pressing for the region's peak body, the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), to formally embrace the One China Policy.Six of PIF's members, including Solomon Islands, continue to recognise Taiwan.Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen recently carried out her own lobbying over the last week, with a visit to Palau, Nauru and the Marshall Islands, which are three of the six Pacific nations which continue to recognise Taiwan. The political landscape in Solomon Islands is a crowded one: 15 political parties are contesting the election with 333 candidates vying for the country's 50 parliamentary seats — only 25 women are contesting this year's poll.Voting will largely take place on just the one day, which, with voters on remote islands, is a logistical challenge.Australia is supplying four defence helicopters to assist with that challenge.It's been somewhat of a carnival atmosphere, with a colourful and loud campaign period as would-be politicians try to woo voters with promises.There have been some reports of vote buying, which election expert Terence Wood from ANU's Development Policy Centre said is to be expected ahead of a Solomon Islands' election.""There's no reason to think this will be different in 2019 … and although vote buying is illegal, laws only serve as deterrents if they're enforced,"" he wrote.""Many strong candidates bought votes in the 2014 elections, but only two MPs lost their seats because of it — hardly a deterrent"".But authorities are attempting to crack down on questionable campaigning — the night before the poll is known as ""Devil's Night"" in Solomon Islands.Candidates and their agents have quite openly in the past given out cash and other gifts like food as they try to shore up last-minute votes.""Sadly vote buying on Devil's Night has now become a common aspect of elections in the country that people speak openly about it without remorse,"" the anti-corruption group, Transparency Solomon Islands, said in a statement.Tougher electoral laws are in place this year and for the first time authorities will be implementing a 24-hour ban on campaigning as a way to counter votes being bought. Over 1,600 police officers are being deployed for election security in the police force's largest operation to date. ""The urban legend of Devil's Night needs to be watched closely and we've got our eyes and ears out as well,"" Solomon Islands Police Commissioner Matthew Varley told the ABC.""The important message is that the police are here to uphold the law.""Electoral officials are also talking with Facebook about how to ensure electoral laws are not violated with campaign material on social media. Corruption has been rife in Solomon Islands, but the previous government hails among its biggest achievements the passing of anti-corruption laws, which will enable it to set up independent commission against corruption.This is something both Australia and Solomon Islands' largest neighbour, Papua New Guinea, have so far failed to do.There's also been a recent police crackdown, with two parliamentarians arrested and charged in late 2018 for the misuse of public funds, including allegations one used constituency money for a private Christmas party. Both men will be contesting the elections, after prosecutors discharged their case against one politician while the other still has a case before the courts.Final election results won't be known for several weeks, as ballot boxes are transferred back from remote polling stations to the closest provincial centre.But while voters in Solomon Islands wait for the official announcement, winning candidates will be lobbying and building coalitions to form the next Government.While there are political parties in Solomon Islands, politics is often a game of personality rather than policy.""Out of all the nine elections since independence, the [serving] prime minister [has only been re-elected] once,"" Mr Wood said.There have also been outbreaks of violence in recent years. In 2014, gunshots were fired at a boat carrying one group of MPs from an island resort, where they'd been taken in an effort to stop them defecting before a parliamentary vote to choose the new prime minister.Riots broke out in 2006 after the election of Snyder Rini as prime minister — he then resigned just eight days later ahead of a no confidence vote.But most close observers, like James Batley, a former Australian high commissioner to Solomon Islands, are confident this year's poll and the announcement of the results should be peaceful.""I think it's well prepared. There's been a few hitches along the way but it's a complicated logistical exercise,"" Mr Batley said.Mr Batley is leading a team of election observers from the Australian National University. ""It does seem to me that everything is pretty much in place.""","Elections, Government and Politics, Pacific, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2019-03-30T19:08:26+00:00

It also participated that June in the Battle of Midway, one of three US aircraft carriers in that decisive encounter.The Hornet suffered severe damage from Japanese dive-bombers and torpedo planes during the Battle of Santa Cruz Island in October 1942, and US ships then unsuccessfully attempted to sink it because it was beyond saving.The Hornet finally went down when two Japanese destroyers fired torpedoes the next night.Most of the crew of 2,170 men had abandoned the ship by the time it sank, but 140 were killed, according to historians.The Vulcan project has located about 20 historically significant vessels to date.Mr Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates, died in October 2018 from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.Vulcan's director of subsea operations, Rob Kraft, paid homage to their founder's legacy.""Paul Allen has said many times that it's important to preserve our past and honour these sailors and these soldiers that gave so much to their country,"" he said.""We're kind of doing the same thing here: we're preserving our past, we're uncovering history and we're trying to educate.""Director of Naval History and Heritage Command, Sam Cox, said the Hornet, though badly damaged by enemy action, would not go down easily. ""We had to sink her ourselves, so our own destroyers fired multiple torpedoes,"" he said.""A lot of them didn't work but the Hornet still refused to go down, so the destroyers fired about 400 five-inch shells [into the ship].""Still she wouldn't go down. By that time there [was] a very powerful Japanese surface force approaching.""The Japanese find the Hornet still afloat after sundown on 26th of October and they contemplate trying to tow it back to Japan.

It is proper AFL rules but with just nine on the field at any point in time.""In Geneva the game is played on a smaller rugby field, using rugby goals for one set of goals along with some homemade point posts.""I think the skill level is surprisingly high,"" Ms Dellar said.""What's really nice about it is that there is such a mix of age ranges. In the Geneva team we have people in their 50s and teenagers and everything in between.""You have some players who are slightly more skilled, slightly more fit, but the standard and the spirit in which we play means that people of all skill levels can get involved.""It's quite a small field so there's a lot of sharing the ball around.""While the Geneva team is made up of almost all Australian expats, there is a player from Canada who spent his teenage years playing the game in Ontario and British Columbia.Many of the Winterthur players are former rugby players who have been taught Australian Rules by an Australian/Swiss dual national who developed a love the game while living in Australia as a child.Swiss teacher Ulrike Senti, 24, fell in love with Australian Rules when she studied abroad in Tasmania a few years ago.She wanted to continue playing once she returned to Europe and after a long search, she discovered the Winterthur Lions team.Ms Senti is now the head of women's development for AFL Switzerland.""It's a really challenging game but that's what I love about it,"" she said.""No-one is perfect at the beginning, you just need to practice and it needs different skills which is why I really like it.""You not only have to run fast but you have to get to know the ball's bounce. Handballing is also a big challenge for people from Europe because were not used to a bouncing ball.""Ms Senti said having Australian teammates playing in the Swiss league reminded her of life in Tasmania.""It is awesome to have Aussies in terms of footy and also in terms of my language,"" she said.""I'm still practicing talking to them and getting to know Australian culture even better.""I already fell in love with Australia when I was in Tasmania so that's why I really enjoy my job.""According to the AFL there are 4,487 participants playing in Europe and 1,165 of those are female.More than 180,000 people play outside of Australia and 44 per cent of those players are women.The countries with the biggest female participation are Papua New Guinea, South Africa and the South Pacific Nations.The Australian Football International Cup has been held in Melbourne every three years since 2002 and features a men's and women's competition.An all-female Australian Rules tournament, the Gallia Cup, was held in France on March 9 and saw teams from Germany, England and France and the Netherlands take part.Ms Senti was part of a group of Swiss women who combined forces with some German players to field a side in the Cup.They ended up winning the tournament.""It was the first all-women's competition that we have seen,"" Ms Dellar said.""In the past couple of years the women's element has been growing rapidly.""I certainly think AFL seems to be giving some European women the opportunity to get involved in sport where they might not have otherwise had that opportunity because you don't really see much of it around to be honest."" Both Ms Dellar and Ms Senti hope to see an all-women's competition established in Switzerland.""The mixed comp is great at the moment, but the dream would be to have individual women's teams from different cities that can play against each other,"" Ms Dellar said.""Hopefully this tournament in Paris has generated some momentum and certainly one of the next exciting things on the horizon is the Euro Cup.""The Euro Cup is an annual nine-a-side tournament in which national sides face-off to contest for the title of champions of Europe. The 2019 event will be held in Norrtalje, Sweden.""The Swiss men's team played last year and for the first time we will be sending a women's team,"" Ms Dellar said.""We will see how that goes in terms of generating a bit of publicity for AFL in Switzerland, particularly for the women.""","Australian National University, Australian Rules Football, Canada, Canberra, England, Fiji, France, Germany, Nauru, Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Perth, Samoa, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sport, Sport Event, Sports Organisations, Sweden, Switzerland, Tonga, Vanuatu, Winter Sports, ",2019-03-19T19:13:38+00:00

272,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-06/pacific-workers-worse-off-backpacker-visa-extension/10469660,"There are fears the Federal Government's plan to increase the number of backpackers working on Australian farms will severely disadvantage workers from the Pacific.On Monday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced an expansion of the working holiday visa (for backpackers) and the Seasonal Worker Programme (for Pacific workers) to help meet labour shortages on farms.The move comes as New Zealand announced on Tuesday it would expand its seasonal workers scheme to 12,850 workers annually, compared to the nearly 8,500 that came to Australia last year.Pacific countries — like Tonga, Vanuatu, Fiji and the Solomon Islands — rely on temporary labour schemes in Australia and New Zealand to provide much needed employment and wages for their people.In the run-up to the next election, Mr Morrison has extended the time seasonal workers can stay in Australia by three months — bringing it up to nine months.Backpackers will be able to work in Australia for three years if they do extra farming work.The changes are seen as way of satisfying calls for a new agricultural visa and have been welcomed by the National Farmers Federation, which said farmers are facing a ""chronic labour shortage"".But Pacific Islands and labour mobility experts say the changes to the visa schemes could lower employer demand for Pacific workers.The expanded visa program for backpackers is opposed by Professor Stephen Howes, the director of the Development Policy Centre at Australian National University.""The biggest source of labour on Australian farms when it comes to picking fruit and vegetables is actually backpackers,"" he said.""Trying to get more backpackers onto farms would definitely hit Pacific Island countries.""In the Solomon Islands, subsistence farming, forestry, fishing, mining, manufacturing and tourism are the major industries.Freda Sikwae, 33, is from Kakabona village, just outside of Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands.Last month she returned from her first season grading fruit at the Nutrano Produce Group's citrus and blueberry farm in Gin Gin, Queensland.The mother of four said she could earn anywhere from $700 to $1,000 a week at the farm in busy periods, much more than the pittance she could earn at home.""In order for me to help my kids I have to go and work so I have a better living than in the Solomons,"" she said.""Build a good house, start a small business like I did now. I start a small canteen and a bottle shop."" The Government has also introduced a new scheme for semi and low-skilled workers, the Pacific Labour Scheme.It will allow people to be employed in industries including tourism, aged care, farming, and hospitality in rural and regional areas.But Professor Howes said ""rich"" backpackers are essentially competing with people from the Pacific for farm work.He said for every 250 seasonal workers on Australian farms, there are 1,000 backpackers.Compare that to New Zealand, which takes in more Pacific workers, with around 3,000 seasonal workers for every 1,000 backpackers.The Government could still introduce a farming visa in the future. ""The NFF is pleased to have the Prime Minister's support for a dedicated Agricultural Visa and we will continue to work with the Parliament to see the initiative become a reality,"" NFF president Fiona Simson said.Dr Alisi Holani, the deputy chief executive of Tonga's Ministry of Commerce, told the ABC she wants to see Australia and New Zealand protect jobs for Pacific workers as a matter of policy.""Because of the still very high demand for labour mobility from the Pacific, any new visa programs that are introduced could actually threaten that need from the Pacific for an increased number of workers.""It would actually be detrimental for the Pacific.""So there is a need for Australia and New Zealand to take into account their role in safeguarding the development impact.""Delegates at last month's Pacific Labour Mobility Annual Meeting in Honiara also raised their concerns about the farm visa plan and extended visas for backpackers.A draft outcomes document expressed concern about the agricultural visa proposal, but the sentence was dropped after opposition from Australia.In the end, Pacific nations called on Australia and New Zealand ""to continue to give preference to workers from the Pacific"".While brushing off questions from the ABC about a possible farm visa, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Rick Hou is hoping Pacific Islands can double or triple the number of seasonal workers they send to both countries.""The National Party is pushing the (Australian) Government to do something and I know the National Party is farmers,"" he said.""Farmers cry for more and more workers.""He said 70 per cent of the country's population is younger than 34 but there are not enough jobs for young people.""The current issue we have in Solomon Islands is there is very high unemployment among our youths,"" Mr Hou said. ""Now in order to address youth unemployment, this is how important labour mobility is to me.""Back on the ground in Kakabona, recruiter Godfrey Teamana said Australia's seasonal workers scheme has been ""life changing"" for the villagers.He recruits and trains workers in the Solomon Islands for the Nutrano Produce Group.""It's really a big impact on the village level,"" he said.""It's really changed their lives of the workers from nothing to somebody today.""","Australia, Business, Economics and Finance, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Industrial Relations, Solomon Islands, ",2018-11-06T08:48:48+00:00

One of its founders, Marion Healy, said the Cup ""empowered the next generation about who they are"" and where they came from.And the stories of that are, at times, undoubtedly troubling.Starting in the 1860s, tens of thousands of Pacific Islanders from places including Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands came to Australia to work in indentured labour on plantations in Queensland.Leading expert, Emeritus Professor Clive Moore from the University of Queensland, said while there was evidence that most of the 62,000 people sent to Australia came willingly, and signed contracts to work on the plantations, a small portion was lured or taken forcibly onto the boats — a practice known as blackbirding.""We generally think in the first several years, maybe the first 10 years, from any island, there was a fair degree of illegality and total misunderstanding by the Islanders of what they were getting themselves into,"" he said.When they got here, the working conditions were sometimes dreadful. People were discriminated against and treated like second-class citizens. And about one in 10 died from sickness.""It's the closest Australia ever came to working people in conditions that were very similar to slavery,"" Emeritus Professor Moore said.It is a history that broader Australia is only hearing about now. This is also the case for some of those in the locker room at Browne Park.

Inside each Voyager vessel, the gold-plated and copper-etched records sit in aluminium cases, with 27 musical items, 55 greetings in different languages, and a collection of sounds that include a kiss, a dog barking, a whale song, and brain waves.The capsule also includes a polygraph needle and etched instructions for how a possible alien might play the music.Dr Glen Nagle from the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex, which receives data from the probes, told the ABC the record was ""a little time capsule"".""[It was] a message in a bottle that we were going to throw out into a giant cosmic ocean of the universe, to basically say 'this is who created this spacecraft, this is who we are, this is our place in the universe, and if you're there, learn about us, and maybe come and see us if you're curious like us'.""The songs include famous tracks like Chuck Berry's Johnny B Goode, and all-but-unknown traditional music from places like Milingimbi in Australia's Arnhem Land and villages in Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands.NASA lists one of the songs as ""panpipes, collected by the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Service"", but the ABC has spoken to family members of the original panpipe group who confirmed the musicians were from the small village of Oroha, in the island province of Malaita.There is no current data for how many people speak the Oroha language, but estimates in the past decade have put that number at only a few hundred people — and the particular style of music on the recording belongs just to them.There were eight men playing the pipes for the recording and Sam Matanai, the nephew of one of the men, Isaac Houmawai, said the song was traditionally reserved for special occasions like feasts.""We are very, very happy that our music, part of us, is in space,"" Mr Matanai told the ABC shortly after Voyager 2 had gone interstellar.The song was recorded by William Bennett, a Solomon Islander who helped found the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Service after fighting in World War II.Mr Matanai said it was understood a copy made its way onto the Golden Record after being taken back to the UK by a visiting journalist.The original recording now sits in the archive of what is now the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation, and current workers at the newsroom told the ABC they were happy to know it was there.While Mr Matanai said there was pride in knowing his family's song was now floating just outside the solar system, there was even more pride in knowing his culture would live on in his village.""We can pass this to other generations in [the] future, because we learned this very well, and we can dance this very well, we can blow this very well. This panpipe was ours, blown by our ancestors.""The 27 songs came from all over the world, including from the Nyaura clan, from the Papua New Guinean village of Kandingei in what is now East Sepik Province.As with the song from Solomon Islands, the detail from NASA is scant, only referencing the song as ""men's house song, recorded by Robert MacLennan"".""The recording that was chosen was performed by two different men on long flutes that are distinctive of the area, associated with men's initiation and men's houses,"" acting director of the Institute of Papua New Guinea studies in Port Moresby, Dr Don Niles, told the ABC.Men's houses are less common in the modern era, but are men-only spaces used for initiation, ceremonies and discussion.Dr Niles was a friend of Robert MacLennan, an Australian doctor who spent years in PNG before he died in 2013 — and according to Dr Niles, Dr MacLennan made hundreds of recordings of traditional music during his life.""He very much fell in love with the place, with the music,"" Dr Niles said.Dr Niles said Dr MacLennan was ""always willing to share"" the recordings with other people, but that the full story of how the music left PNG and made it onto the Golden Record was one Dr Niles was always ""put off hearing"" as he was waiting for the right moment.""Unfortunately that never happened, as Bob died a few years ago,"" he said.Since leaving Earth in 1977, the Voyager probes have collected a world of data and information about life in our solar system and beyond.And in 2017, the record was made commercially available for the first time in decades, and even won a Grammy music award that year.But Dr Niles said the record was much more than ""just about Nyaura clan, about East Sepik Province, about Papua New Guinea"".""This is something that represents the earth, and its creations,"" he said.","Arts, Culture and Entertainment, Astronomy (Space), Community and Society, History, Indigenous Music, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Science and Technology, Solomon Islands, Space Exploration, Spacecraft, United States, ",2018-12-30T19:09:55+00:00

The latest was a 14-year-old boy, who was attacked while diving for fish with his friends in August, while a six-year-old was killed in late May as he swam in a creek.""It's the largest species of crocodile in the world … they are responsible for a number of attacks throughout their range and Solomon Islands is no different,"" Matthew Brien, acting manager for northern wildlife operations at the Queensland Department of Environment and Science, told Pacific Beat. ""Over the last 10 years, there appears to be a large number of attacks on people, so it is really important to manage this species.""A specialised police crocodile control unit was set up last year to hunt down reptiles causing trouble for local communities.Its officers are the only ones allowed to shoot the crocodiles, but they are based in the capital Honiara and respond to incidents across the country once communities request help.It is widely believed the country's crocodile population began to grow when a ban on harvesting and exporting their skins came into effect 30 years ago.The ban was put in place after crocodile numbers dropped due to overharvesting and the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) placed the crocodile on its endangered list for Solomon Islands.Since then there have been no accurate figures on the number of crocodiles in the Solomons, which is why the Government has now ordered a national crocodile survey to be carried out, as it looks to make a decision on possibly lifting that ban.Dr Brien, who studied crocodile behaviour as part of his PhD, has been in Solomon Islands to provide advice on the survey.""It's very challenging to do standard boat surveys in places like the Solomons that have so many remote islands, so their approach to this issue is very innovative, and I believe they've got some very good data that should help inform upcoming management programs and anything else the Government decides to do,"" Dr Brien said.Members of the public have been calling for the ban on crocodile harvesting and trade to be lifted, suggesting such a measure would help control the population.The prospect of generating economic activity from crocodiles is an attractive one, as it would provide much-needed jobs and income for the Pacific nation of 600,000 people — and a return to the skin trade is one possibility the Government is considering.But Australian John Lever, who pioneered crocodile farming in neighbouring Papua New Guinea in the 1970s, said crocodile tourism would be a better option for Solomon Islands.""In the Solomons where you have a limited population of crocodiles, the best future for them is not the skin industry but rather for the tourism industry, same as in PNG and Australia [where] crocodiles are used as a public education facility,"" he said.""Everybody would like to see big crocodiles, so being able to go out and catch crocodiles and put them in a facility where people can see these large crocodiles and see the feeding [would be worthwhile].""The other thing people really like to see are baby crocodiles. If you get to stage where you get captive breeders actually breeding, then an exciting time for all is to see the babies hatching out of eggs.""Once completed next month, the Solomon Islands' Government intends to use the survey results to develop a crocodile management plan.It will also petition for saltwater crocodiles to be removed from the endangered species list.","Animal Attacks, Animals, Crocodile, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Tourism and Leisure Industry, ",2018-09-20T05:27:20+00:00

I think that's what politics is all about,"" she said.In 2014, a private Vanuatu company completed the country's first submarine internet cable linking the capital Port Vila to the international fibre optic network via Fiji, and construction has begun on a second cable that will link to the Solomon Islands.Vanuatu's Infrastructure Minister Jotham Napat said last week that in light of Australia's investment in the Solomon Islands cable, Vanuatu should get a similar deal.""The support that the Australian Government is providing to the Solomons Government, they have to do the same for Vanuatu,"" Mr Napat said.Australian taxpayers will foot most of the bill for the 4,000-kilometre Solomon Islands cable, which will also connect Papua New Guinea to high-speed internet, paid for with funds from the Australian Government's $1.3 billion aid commitment to the Pacific announced in May.","Asia, Australia, China, Community and Society, Defence and National Security, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, Pacific, Security Intelligence, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2018-06-27T05:21:51+00:00

""My Government is prepared to go as far as putting the companies on a black list internationally if they do not take on their responsibilities,"" he said at a media conference yesterday.Mr Hou, who faces an election on April 3, has sought Australia's assistance to clean up the oil spill, which he described as causing ""irreversible damage"", after acknowledging his country's resources were inadequate for the task.""The ecological footprint of the whole bay is already devastated with much of it unlikely to recover,"" he said.""The impact on the marine life and the coral is already massive with much of it irreversible.""The bulk carrier MV Solomon Trader ran aground on a reef near the remote island of Rennell in the south of the Solomon Islands over a month ago while attempting to load bauxite from a nearby mine in poor weather.A Solomon Islands bid for an insurance payout from the ship's owners is likely to be delayed, with the country not party to a key maritime treaty that allows payouts directly from insurance companies.Professor Craig Forrest from the marine and shipping law unit at the University of Queensland said because the Solomon Islands was not a signatory of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of Ships, its options were very limited.""The Solomon Islands cannot go directly to the insurer, so the only entity they can look to is the ship's owner,"" he told the ABC.Mr Hou said tax concessions to the miner meant the Government had earned next to nothing in tax. He also said that while authorities were struggling to contain the oil spill and salvage the wrecked vessel, the company, with the support of local chiefs, was continuing to mine and ship bauxite out of the country.""It is my government's view that exporting our resources for virtually no economic [return] is immoral and unacceptable,"" he said.Indonesian company Bintan Mining, which chartered the ship, has previously said it has done all it can to assist recovery efforts. The ship's insurer, Korea Protection and Indemnity Club, and owner, King Trader Ltd, both issued a statement this week apologising for the spill.""Although matters of liability are yet to be determined, the vessel's protection indemnity insurer and the owner have expressed deep remorse,"" the companies said in a statement.Footage taken this week shows little progress has been made in stopping the flow of oil since the ship ran aground.International lawyer and Solomon Islands fisheries expert Transform Aqorau said the scale of the disaster was unprecedented in the island's history.""It's the worst environmental man-made disaster and we have never experienced something like this,"" he told the ABC.A DFAT official told reporters Australian support was on the way, with two Australian vessels scheduled to arrive on Sunday to help with the clean-up.","Environment, Environmental Health, Environmental Impact, Mining Environmental Issues, Solomon Islands, ",2019-03-08T03:33:00+00:00

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop argues Pacific nations shouldn't be left in a position where they only have China to turn to for capital.With one breath, there's fierce debate in Federal Parliament about curbing foreign influence in Australia. But the next moment, Canberra is seeking to ensure its own influence, reputation and clout in the Pacific isn't diminished. Vanuatu's Prime Minister Charlot Salwai will get the full pomp and ceremony welcome to Parliament House this morning, a week-and-a-half after his Solomon Islands counterpart Rick Houenipwela received the same treatment.While in town, Mr Houenipwela signed a deal with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull for a 4,000-kilometre, high-speed, undersea internet cable between Honiara and Sydney — a project Australian taxpayers will foot most of the bill for. The cash from the foreign aid budget was thrown at the cable once Australia's intelligence agencies caught wind that Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei was not only sniffing around the project, but already had an in-principle deal with the Solomons. Concerns about the security risk Huawei presents are well documented around the world. Mr Salwai is likely to ask Mr Turnbull to chip in for a similar project to his country, which is marginally closer to Australia. It will provide another opportunity for Canberra to try to ward off seemingly attractive offers from Beijing.""China follows a development path that is completely different from that of traditional major powers,"" China's ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye told a business forum in Parliament House last week, defending his nation from reports it was leaving small Pacific countries laden with debt.""China never interferes in the internal affairs of other countries.""That's not the way Canberra views it. Despite arguing our relationship with Beijing is strong and robust, there has been strain in recent months.There is tension even if the relationship isn't broken, as China's appetite for influence across the globe becomes insatiable.It's a conundrum for Australia's Government — the might of the world's second-largest economy and its aggressive state-driven expansionist policies make competing for diplomatic territory difficult, but Australia doesn't want to cede to China as the dominant power in its own backyard.

Ian Thorpe, an ambassador for the Games and one of our greatest sportsmen, told me he thinks Invictus gets back the purity of sport.Thorpe says that for some people sport is about winning, but for others it is just about getting there.He reckons that is how sport can deliver something for everyone. You do not have to be Thorpie in the pool to enjoy it.That is writ large by Aussie competitor and former Army medic Stewart Sherman.Stewart is competing in archery and wheelchair tennis but for him, the idea of representing Australia in sport is hilarious — ""Sucked in PE teacher!"" — he sputters out with a giant wry grin.And there is a whole lot of that wonderful ironic humour here at the Games, juxtaposed against a work history that most of us find hard to fathom.Stewart says his job as a medic ""only got going when things got really bad"". It is hard to watch him describe serving in Afghanistan and picking up a small child's foot in a blue thong, just a foot, knowing that he has three small children of his own.Stewart is one of the many competitors at these Games with injuries you cannot see.And here, unlike at a Paralympic Games, you may see people like Stewart competing in a wheelchair.The other inclusive element of Invictus is that people who become ill or injured during the course of their service — not necessarily on a battlefield — are on the teams too. Men and women compete together in the team sports. And many competitors are competing in multiple disciplines.But whether they are taking on one event or six, every competitor I have spoken to here says they are competing for other people as well as themselves.Rob Saunders, who secured gold for Australia in the sailing, told me his medal is for all the people who have helped him. For his family, for his mates and for the volunteers who helped train our sailing team.The team includes people like Davin ""Bear"" Bretherton, who up until about four months ago had never sailed a boat in his life.Bear took out silver in the Hansa division and is fairly happy with that, and now has the wheelchair rugby ahead of him.He served 14 years in the Australian Army, which included a deployment to Somalia.He is here to celebrate how far he has come, with the support of his family, since the day he tried to kill himself in his garage.Talk to other competitors from the 18 nations here for the Games and so many of them also say that Invictus is about respect for yourself.Some say that being part of the Games brings you back to life, gives you a moment to be back with your military family, and helps you realise you can have a life outside it.And from what I have seen so far, the Invictus Games celebrate love. Love of your country, love of your fellow man, the love of family and friends.And besides, it is a chance to give a whole bunch of people a giant international hug from all of us Down Under.

Its general manager Craig Gibsone fears for future.""We're under attack, we're fighting for survival, the attack is just so severe,"" Mr Gibsone said.""At the moment, I won't say that we're losing but we're certainly not winning … it just seems to be getting worse."" With exports of palm oil and copra worth at least $50 million a year, there are fears processed foods will replace its nutrition.With the discovery that the beetle has now reached the southern hemisphere's largest plantation in the Russell Islands, the country's Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Taskforce has ramped up its community campaign.As part of the solution, a workshop in Honiara this week tackled the sensitive task of convincing the community that villagers need to change the way they manage their coconut trees.""That's the big issue at the moment: to try and persuade village farmers to change habits of a lifetime,"" taskforce head Bob Macfarlane said.""In the past, they could let a palm die and fall down and rot and it didn't matter … you didn't have to do anything at all … that must change now.""Every palm that dies must either be used in some way, for charcoal, for timber, for veneering or whatever.""Rhinoceros beetle larvae breed and feed on dead palm trees, which is why GPPOL is attacking the problem at its conception.GPPOL employs 1,500 people on the Guadalcanal plains, who mostly live onsite with their families. In order to tackle the intruder, however, the company has taken on 100 workers to search out larvae in their rotting habitats and destroy them — a dozen crates full is a good day's work.""I've heard figures of loss of 50 per cent of crop in the years following a major attack … and that's if we can control it … if we don't get control of [the situation], I fear we might lose oil palm altogether,"" Mr Gibsone said.The silver bullet, though, is a biological control like the virus that saved the coconuts plantations of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga 60 years ago, when another variety of rhinoceros beetle destroyed more than half of them.Sadly, the Solomon Islands' coconut rhinoceros beetle is resistant to the virus that worked in Fiji so the search is on for its own biological control.""You have to match the DNA of the strain of beetle that we have with DNA from the country of origin,"" Mr Macfarlane said.""There's no certainty yet but we believe it comes from the Philippines or Indonesia or Vietnam and we have to do a DNA match and then try and identify what is keeping it under control in those countries and then import that.""Can Solomon Islands live with the rhinoceros beetle or will it be forever changed? ""[It's] a big question,"" Mr Macfarlane said.""If we can get the right disease … the right parasite, predator, population suppressing organism, whatever you want to call it … into the country and we get the population down and people do change their behaviour in that they're cleaning up the breeding sites, then yes, we can get back to something like what it was before, but there are a lot of ifs and buts along the way.""Mr Gibsone has explained that the stakes are much higher than the future of his company.""It's a great crop for tropical countries, especially developing tropical countries and we employ a lot of people here … we support a lot of local people who have their own oil palm, and we have plans for expansion because it is a good growing region [with] great yields, but first we have to get on top of this beetle,"" he said.","Agricultural Crops, Biology, Invertebrates - Insects and Arachnids, Pacific, Solomon Islands, ",2018-03-10T19:18:42+00:00

And I think because there is a high degree of public concern about accountability of the aid program, we're calling on the Government to make it more transparent,"" he said.A deal on how the project will be funded is expected to be announced in coming weeks, however the Government has already confirmed it will fund the majority of the project, and will do so out of its overseas aid program.DFAT said Vocus was awarded the scoping study contract on account of its ""extensive, recent experience with similar infrastructure projects"", and that the company was ""assessed as being best placed to explore potential cable solutions"".It said the tender process was carried out in accordance with the procurement rules and transparency requirements.Vocus has recently installed submarine cable infrastructure between Darwin and Port Hedland. Another project linking Perth, Jakarta and Singapore is scheduled for completion in July.The ABC understands Vocus did not have the capacity to complete submarine cable builds at the time the donations were made.""This donation was made prior to the Vocus acquisition of Nextgen Networks, the entity within Vocus group responsible for this project,"" the company said in a statement.The company said the political donations were made by its former board and management team.Its management team has gone through major changes in recent months, with former CEO Geoff Horth stepping down in late February by ""mutual agreement"" after two years in the top job.Shortly before his departure, Mr Horth told the ABC that Vocus was well-placed to deliver the scoping study on behalf of the Australian Government.""I think what we can demonstrate is as an organisation, we're a listed Australian company that has a great reputation and strong credentials in designing and building these types of systems,"" he said.The scoping study was completed and handed to the government at the end of March.The project's next phase is expected to begin in the second half of this year, with the cable due to be completed by the end of 2019.

''The Fairtrade minimum price gives us a good price to sustain our operation when prices collapse or drop. And the Fairtrade premium, which we use for empowering our community through community development projects,"" Mr Kinne saidIn the 11 years since Eastern Highland growers formed a Fairtrade cooperative, their remote, subsistence communities have strengthened ties between each other, built schools, homes for teachers, improved roads and coffee drying techniques and accessed safer water by running a pipe upstream.""We come from a very remote district where there's little government presence,"" Mr Kinne said.He said if teachers could not be attracted to the remote communities, future generations could not learn.""We have prioritised education, so we build good classrooms for our children and houses for teachers,'' he said.Fairtrade Australia New Zealand CEO Molly Harriss Olson said Fairtrade gave producers a minimum price to ensure a sustainable livelihood and empowered them to take control of their lives.""In the Fairtrade world these producers become strong small entrepreneurial businesses in their poor communities and they can help the rest of their community strengthen their futures,"" Ms Harriss Olson said.Montville Coffee's Sean McGowan said Fairtrade ensured standards and obligations were met.""I guess one of the things that always concerned me when a product is uncertified is that there are no assurances, there's always a risk that these particular environments might not have environmental standards which are transparently and authentically audited. ""Child labour laws might not be in place, or matters such as the marginalisation of women aren't being addressed.""With Fairtrade you have standards and obligations which the growers must adhere to, which gives us tremendous confidence with that third party certification, that the product we're bringing to our customers is of the highest standard.""We want to rehumanise the food chain and our purpose is to do that through coffee,"" Mr McGowan said.Coffee is just one of more than 2,500 Fairtrade certified products supplied by 1.65 million farmers and workers globally.The delegation also visited the Tweed Valley in northern New South Wales to inspect a cane farm and  seed-plot and to tour the local sugar mill in Condong.Pravin Singh, is president of the Lautoka Cane Producers Association which represents about 5,400 of the nearly 17,000 farmers in Fiji, all of whom are Fairtrade certified.He cited the size of farm land as one of the challenges for cane growers in Fiji.""We have an average of 8-10 hectares per farmer, which is really not a big land,"" he said.""Maybe 80 per cent at the moment is manually harvested, but we have been brought in mechanical harvesting and now have 39-40 harvesters.""Mr Singh said other challenges facing the Fijian cane industry were climate change and the shortage of labour.""The sugar cane farmers are ageing and the younger generation doesn't want to come to work in farming, because of prices probably,"" he said.Fiji expects to harvest 2.1 million to 2.2 million tonnes of cane this year with the majority of that exported.""We used to export to Tate & Lyle [a London based sugar refiner] who was our major buyer, but due to the collapse of sugar cane scenarios and the world market we're looking for other markets,"" he said.Ms Harriss Olson said Fairtrade Australia New Zealand was also helping farmers to find new export opportunities.","Agricultural Crops, Beverages, Brisbane, Business, Economics and Finance, Fiji, Food and Beverage Processing Industry, Industry, International Aid and Trade, Lifestyle and Leisure, Maroochydore, Montville, Papua New Guinea, Rural, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Sugar, Tea Coffee, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trade, ",2017-08-25T05:33:04+00:00

288,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-01/malaria-sweeping-asia-but-tafenoquine-offers-hope/9923622,"Disease outbreaks such as Ebola are genuinely terrifying. We normally associate them with the exotic and the unknown — UN emergency workers tramping through African dust in biohazard suits, fighting a rearguard action against a mysterious foe. However, just 150 kilometres north of Australia a more familiar outbreak is unfolding. An ancient parasite is spreading faster than at any time this century.In Papua New Guinea, malaria is resurging with a vengeance. There were an estimated 1.4 million malaria cases in the country in 2016, which amounts to a 400 per cent increase, according to the World Health Organisation; 3000 people died.Close to 60 per cent of malaria cases in PNG are among children under 15 years and too many don't survive the onslaught.A little further north, malaria is morphing into new and dangerous strains. In the Greater Mekong Subregion, malaria parasites are developing resistance to the main medicine, artemisinin combination therapy. In parts of Cambodia, 60 per cent of malaria treatments are impaired; in parts of Vietnam, the rate is 30 per cent and rapidly increasing. There are very few ""combination drugs"" left to treat malaria in the region and time is running out. Soon, malaria may become untreatable.If drug-resistant malaria spreads across Myanmar into India and Africa the global death toll would be immense.Thankfully, medicine and science provide new hope.A breakthrough medicine, tafenoquine, is currently being reviewed by Australia's therapeutic goods administration.This medicine provides a radical cure for recurring malaria, moving from the current 12 dose course to a single tablet. Relapsing malaria accounts for half the Asia Pacific's malaria burden, so draining this reservoir of infection is an important step towards malaria elimination. Its likely approval would be particularly useful in the Pacific. The Commonwealth recently announced a significant investment in medicine approval systems across the Asia Pacific. By sharing its technical expertise, Australia can help make Tafenoquine available where it is needed. This will lead to faster uptake of drugs like tafenoquine.Rapid diagnostic testing is the other side of the innovation equation, allowing a potential case to be diagnosed in under 15 minutes. Australia is helping to make these available, but we can and should accelerate progress.In wealthy, developed Australia, it is comforting to think we are immune to such outbreaks. However, in a globally connected world, this might be a foolhardy assumption. Just last September, for example, a four-year-old girl died of cerebral malaria in northern Italy.Every year we don't eliminate malaria is another year of unfulfilled human and economic potential. Malaria's effect on education, training and productivity in our own region is an economic deadweight on our collective prosperity. Eliminating malaria from the Asia Pacific by 2030 will provide savings in health care costs, lost wages and productivity of about US$90 billion. A study of Latin America and the United States found the average yearly income of those born after malaria eradication campaigns increased about 25 per cent, on a like for like basis. It is in all our interests to maintain progress towards malaria elimination. Australia's commitment to fight the world's deadliest animal, the mosquito, is also political. In 2014, Australia led 18 governments to commit to eliminate malaria by 2030. Since then, domestic financing among those nations has increased 40 per cent. This is an overlooked benefit of smart aid. When wealthy nations show leadership, it galvanises others.More recently, Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop bolstered Australia's commitment to end malaria by joining the End Malaria Council in London. Again, this was galvanizing and led PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to accelerate their efforts to end malaria by 2030. As global funding sources will gradually phase out of the region, Australia's leadership is especially important. In the first week of July, Melbourne will host the Malaria World Congress. As we tackle this millennia-old disease we must harden our scientific, financial and political will to end malaria for good.Dr Benjamin Rolfe is chief executive of the Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance.","Australia, Cambodia, Community and Society, Diseases and Disorders, Health, Malaria, Medical Research, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Science and Technology, Solomon Islands, Vietnam, ",2018-06-30T19:00:00+00:00

Or is it coming from other parts of the aid program?"" Professor Howes said.""While those are legitimate questions, it's also the case that this is potentially a very high return project, and a lot of time the aid program in the Pacific struggles to find high return projects.""I think you can make a case this is potentially a good use of aid funding, but it is really going to depend on the structure put around it"".PNG and the Solomon Islands are expected to own the infrastructure and will share the revenue generated.Last year PNG received $546 million in Australian aid, while Solomon Islands got $142 million.Jonathon Pryke, director at the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, said if the cable was financed by aid money from the bilateral aid programs of PNG and Solomon Islands, it would be highly disruptive.""If we take the assumption that it's around $130 to $150 million, split maybe half and half between Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, that's the equivalent of 50 per cent of our bilateral aid spend in Solomon Islands, and it's the equivalent of about 10 per cent of our aid spend in Papua New Guinea,"" he said.""The aid dollar is already stretched and allocated across a whole number of sectors and so that is a substantial amount of money, and considering we expect the project to be completed by November 2019, it's not like we can stretch it out over five or 10 years to reduce the burden on these countries.""The majority of that funding has been spent on what the Australian Government calls ""effective governance"", which pays for programs focused on electoral reform, combatting corruption and improving access to justice.Significantly less is spent on infrastructure in both countries; making up about a fifth of both country's Australian aid budgets.But ACFID's Mr Purcell predicts that will change in coming budgets.""I think we can speculate we're going to see more of this kind of infrastructure aid in the future in response to the much reported concerns about China's presence in the Pacific and its use of its aid program and concessional loans for hard infrastructure,"" he said.","Australia, Budget, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2018-05-05T18:50:40+00:00

The people of the Solomons have not forgotten.I met Mr Warner in Cambodia in 1992, when he was attached to the Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh. Then foreign minister Gareth Evan had been a key figure in developing the United Nations plan for the demobilisation of four rival armies and the preparation for democratic elections.Mr Warner was playing a part in making that Herculean task work. He was a young diplomat then but can lay claim to a role in one of the most successful UN missions in history. He rose to be the head of the Department of Defence before being appointed the director-general of Australian Secret Intelligence Service.That agency operates off-shore to gather intelligence to protect Australia's interests and keep its people safe. Its agents also engage in the ""disruption"" of operations that threaten Australia. There are many threats to Australia in the region but when one of our defence chiefs was recently asked what kept him awake at night he answered in two words: ""The Philippines.""Mr Warner's visit to the presidential palace speaks volumes about the Government's level of concern about the rise of Islamic State in the southern Philippines. In July, Attorney-General George Brandis met with regional counterparts to discuss terrorist fighters returning from foreign wars. In the final communique, ministers from six countries expressed ""grave concern"" at the growth of radicalism and violent extremism and also noted the ""rapidly evolving"" threats facing the region.To confront those threats Australia needs the cooperation of all the region's leaders, even those many find objectionable. That's part of Mr Warner's job.But in the age of permanent moral outrage the spy chief is now being condemned on the evidence of a single photograph.The picture shows him fist pumping alongside Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte. This apparently means he is giving full throated support to the President's brutal policies. Anyone who knows Mr Warner can attest that this is absurd.A quick browse of the President's website shows he often encourages those who visit the palace raise their fists with him.And if briefly humouring Mr Duterte is the price of encouraging his cooperation with Australia in the fight against Islamic State then it is a small one to pay. If only keeping the peace meant just dealing with the honourable.Many images are burned in my mind from that visit to war ravaged Cambodia in 1992, particularly children who had lost their limbs to mines. But one moment lingers. It was when an Australian official pointed out two men having lunch in a Phnom Penh restaurant.""That guy is from the CIA,"" he whispered. ""And the other one is a Khmer Rouge leader.""Making peace in Cambodia meant enlisting the devil. George Orwell is credited with saying: ""We sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm.""The soft spoken, urbane Mr Warner could hardly be described as a rough man. But he is standing watch. And we should be glad he is.

tomorrow, as the country eyes a lasting peace after ethnic violence that left it on the brink of collapse.The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) saw Australia, New Zealand and 13 other Pacific countries send help to stabilise the island nation, at the request of its government.Australia spent an estimated $2.8 billion on the 14-year mission, contributing 7,200 soldiers and 1,700 Australian Federal Police officers to the effort.But as the mission draws to a close, there are concerns over whether the current peace will endure — and in the words of the country's Prime Minister, Solomon Islands has arrived at a crossroads in its history.The ethnic violence in Solomon Islands between 1998 and 2003 — which locals refer to as ""the tensions"" — saw fighting between militants from Guadalcanal island and the nearby island of Malaita.— Solomon Islands Truth and Reconciliation Commission Militants in Guadalcanal began targeting migrants from Malaita, who had travelled to Guadalcanal to seek employment in the capital Honiara, and had over the years created multiple settlements on the island.The militants resented the growing influence settlers commanded over the island, as well as the settlers' presence on their lands.The resulting violence saw thousands of Malaitan settlers flee back to their home island or to the relative safety of the capital.A Malaitan militant force was set up in response, further entrenching unrest across the country, and the police force began to take sides in the violence.After years of worsening conflict and fruitless peace efforts, Solomon Islands found itself on the verge of becoming a failed state.In 2003 the Solomon Islands government made a formal request for assistance to its regional neighbours, and RAMSI was born.Australian soldiers and federal police quickly restored law and order and confiscated thousands of guns.But it was not an easy mission — two Australians died, one was shot in the back.""On the side of law and order [RAMSI] was clearly very successful,"" said James Batley, a former special coordinator of RAMSI and Australian High Commissioner to Solomon Islands.""And dramatically so early on, when the militant groups disarmed and their weapons were destroyed.""Mr Batley spoke to the ABC from Honiara, where he is participating in the end-of-mission celebrations.""It's really very striking just how warm the messages we are hearing here in Honiara are,"" he saidAustralia's Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove and representatives from other participating Pacific countries were also given a warm, traditional welcome to the capital.Justice Minister Michael Keenan attended the ceremonies and said Australia was duty-bound to lead a regional intervention.""Australia could not afford to have a failed state on our doorstep,"" he said.""We are essentially the superpower in the Pacific, and it's very important that we play our role.""Beyond just ending the conflict, RAMSI had a broad mandate.The mission also involved repairing national institutions, restoring government finances and the aiding the operation of the public service.The police force also needed renewal after its participation in the conflict, and was rearmed on a limited basis earlier this year for the first time since the violence ended.44 unarmed Australian Federal Police (AFP) officers will also remain in the country after the withdrawal to serve as trainers.But the mission was not without its critics — one of the most strident among them being the current Solomon Islands Prime Minister, Manasseh Sogavare.While Mr Sogavare had previously accused the mission of undermining his country's sovereignty, and had even threatened to terminate the effort, he has changed his views in recent times.Speaking in Parliament earlier this week, he praised RAMSI for fully achieving its mandate.""It faced a lot of challenges, but of course none of which deterred the mission from pursuing and achieving the objectives it set out to achieve,"" he said.""Law and order has been restored, [the] machinery of government is functioning again.""Opposition leader Jeremiah Manele said there was anxiety in some parts of the country over what would happen after the withdrawal.Acknowledging these concerns, Mr Sogavare described Solomon Islands as being at a crossroads, but said the country's second chance at peace was an exciting challenge.""We must learn to live together in harmony,"" he said.""We must learn, Mr Speaker, to see our differences as a point of strength.""Not everyone is convinced that lessons have been properly learnt following the unrest.""The Solomon Islands Government did not make use of the opportunity when RAMSI [was] here to solve the underlying causes,"" Guadalcanal Premier Anthony Veke said.Mr Veke said land rights on Guadalcanal, a major grievance of the militants there, have not seen any progress.He said the Government could have used the stability provided by RAMSI to make inroads.""If the Government wants to see Solomon Islands stability … they have to be able to address these land issues in Guadalcanal.""Mr Batley is aware of these arguments.""There's no doubt that there's a bit of nervousness around,"" he said.""Some thoughtful Solomon Islanders are asking the question: 'Did we sufficiently make use of the opportunity that RAMSI provided to really address the really deep issues?'""There is a bit of national debate around, but I think overwhelmingly the feeling is that the time is right.""Mr Veke was also positive about the prospect of an enduring peace in Solomon Islands.""I'm confident that the country's future is bright and in good hands,"" he said.""Especially with the new Commissioner of Police … and also with the more than 40 AFP who will be remaining.""I think they can still continue to provide an environment in which the common can actually address those issues.""","Australia, New Zealand, Pacific,

We understand the reality of those who might object.""But the Government is ensuring that thorough consultation is being carried out and we are listening to the various stakeholders, particularly those that are located in the area of the mine site.""The chairman of the landowner company, Walton Naezon, said local landholders did not oppose the Government's push to reopen the mine.But he told Pacific Beat it would take time.""We're trying to restructure and rehabilitate an old mine which has gone, run down almost 100 per cent,"" he said.""We are going to look at all the aspects of environment issues [and] we are going to make sure that our foreign partners are listening to us.""We want to do everything right according to law.

They love to play, and they come together whenever there is a futsal competition.""The ethnic violence in Solomon Islands between 1998 and 2003, which locals call ""the tensions"", was a violent conflict between militants from Guadalcanal island and settlers from the nearby island of Malaita.The settlers came to Guadalcanal seeking opportunities in Honiara, but this led to resentment from locals.The Solomon Islands Truth and Reconciliation Commission estimates around 200 people were killed during the tensions, although the total number of those killed is not known.These deaths stemmed from fighting between militants, as well as from injuries sustained during torture, beatings and abductions.Several thousand Malaitans living on Guadalcanal fled their homes during the violence, and many children were caught up in the chaos.New South Wales-based Pastor Brian Codrington helped introduce futsal to the country back in 2002, before the players that just toured Australia were even born.He first travelled to the country during the tensions period and had gone to deliver shoeboxes of gifts for Christmas with the aid group Samaritans Purse, but a conversation with the then-mayor of Honiara provided inspiration.""I said well it's one thing to hand out little aid boxes over Christmas, but what else can we do long-term ... Through the answer to that question really came the need to do something for the pikinini, the young kids of the Solomon Islands,"" Mr Codrington said.""[They] had really — as the mayor of Honiara would describe it — no hope for the future because they'd seen the effects of a civil war."" He said back then, he found kids who had lost all hope in their country -- but there was one thing they had a passion for.""The Solomon Islanders' passion is outdoor football,  and so because of their passion for the outdoor game and the minimal number of fields they have available, small court soccer lent itself so easily to the Solomons way of life,"" he said.With no organised sport for children, Mr Codrington made it his mission to help where he could, and they have been sending teams to compete in the Australian competition since 2003.""We would see so many kids in the absence of balls kicking around paper bags, kicking around anything they could find under a coconut tree,"" he said.""The nucleus of the current Kurukuru team [the Solomon Islands national team] has come out of those boys and the boys that followed in quick succession after them.""The national team defied the odds at last year's Futsal World Cup in Columbia, and despite finishing at the bottom of their group, they still went home as champions.For the side's captain Elliot Ragomo, it was an emotional experience.""I tell you, before we play today, one school in my country is not going to school. The whole school stop, they stop to watch us play,"" he said in a teary speech after the tournament.""You don't understand how Solomons people love us, they are crazy when we play,"" Ragomo said.Mr Bate'e said he has seen first hand the change futsal is bringing to the communities he works with.""In the communities where I was brought up, there's big criminal activities, but now we introduce the game of futsal and it brings the community together and it reduces the crime rate,"" he said.Mr Codrington and his team have also developed a program called SALT — Sports and Leadership Training — that is developing new leaders, training coaches, referees and administrators. There's now a local league that has had a local sponsor come on board, because it's seen the value of the futsal in assisting community development.""We're seeking to make the difference physically, relationally, emotionally and spiritually, and to have organisations that are standing beside us in that and providing resources is wonderful,"" he said.","Australia, Human Interest, NSW, Pacific, Soccer, Solomon Islands, Sport, Sydney, World Politics, ",2017-01-13T18:57:02+00:00

It's not been a long time since we were going through the civil unrest and that's what worries me.""In the 13 years since the tensions, many of the old police officers have been replaced by new recruits.Those recruits have been trained by foreign police, and officers now have other weapons, like batons and OC (pepper) spray, with which to subdue crowds and criminals.The RSPIF have also been given a new armoury, with a range of protective mechanisms and processes, in which to store their new weapons.Superintendent Stanley Riolo said it was far better than the previous armoury, which was raided during the civil unrest.""Compared to what we had in the past, I think this is the most secure equipment that we have,"" he said.The firearms will not be issued until the Solomon Islands Cabinet decides police are ready.But it is likely to happen before Australian officers leave the islands in the middle of next year, ending the long RAMSI mission.","Australia, Crime, Law, Crime and Justice, Pacific, Police, Solomon Islands, Unrest, Conflict and War, ",2016-09-24T01:41:50+00:00

310,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2016-10-12/how-migrant-workers-are-critical-to-agriculture/7922368,"More than 900,000 immigrants on permanent and temporary visas enter Australia each year. Most live and work in Australian capital cities, and immigrants are more urbanised than the average Australian today.However, in the past decade or so, new visa pathways have opened up to attract new immigrant workers and their families to the Australian bush. Increased chances of selection attracts permanent skilled immigrants to accept employment in regional and rural towns.At the same time, increasing numbers of temporary migrants on working holiday, student and skilled 457 visas are attracted to the bush. A new program for Pacific Seasonal Workers has also been introduced.With that, immigrant workers add substantially to productivity in the agricultural industry, a new report reveals.For policymakers, the attraction of getting migrants to rural areas is that it helps reduce labour shortages — particularly during seasonal harvesting peaks — and counteracts the trend of population movement away from the bush to the metropolis.Immigrants, including refugees, play a critical role in the Australian agricultural industry. Some of these immigrants become entrepreneurs, opening up a business. Skilled immigrants in the agricultural sector were also much more likely to have set up their own business (15 per cent) than those in other industries (9.6 per cent).When set against the Australian average rate of entrepreneurship (those in the workforce who are self-employed or employers) of 10 per cent, this propensity for immigrant entrepreneurship in the Australian agricultural sector is very encouraging, since entrepreneurs drive employment and productivity growth in the industry.457 visa skilled workers find employers in the bush eager to sponsor their immigration application, particularly in professional and technical occupations. Working holiday makers fill critical jobs during harvesting and picking seasons.Seasonal workers from the Pacific are eager to supplement the income of their families back home via remittances. They also get to learn new skills.Immigrant farmers fill the growing intergenerational gap in farm succession and bring with them new technologies and innovations to Australian farming.For example, Zimbabwean immigrant Nicky Mann and her husband introduced hydroponic rose-growing at their NSW Central Coast operation. Vietnamese and Chinese market gardeners have introduced many new vegetables to expand Australians' food horizons.Australia takes in about half of all working holiday makers who enter OECD countries. They can work and travel around Australia from job to job. The carrot is a 12-month extension to their visa if they work more than 88 days in the bush. The agriculture, forestry and fishing industries receive the greatest benefit from this arrangement.Working holiday makers come from more than 20 countries. The UK, South Korea, Ireland, Germany, Taiwan and France provide the largest numbers. Fieldwork with Korean working holiday makers found the majority arrived with the intention of working in the agricultural industry.Most reported that the best thing about their experience was that they had good relations with the non-Koreans they worked with in Australia, learned new skills, had to opportunity to improve their English, and received good wages.The Pacific seasonal workers program allows workers from East Timor, Nauru, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu to work in low-skilled jobs for up to seven months in a 12-month period. Most work in the horticultural industry.The annual intake has grown from around 400 in 2010-11. It is now an uncapped, demand-driven immigration stream that has expanded to jobs in the broader agriculture industry — including the accommodation sector.Many permanent and temporary immigrants in the bush, particularly those who work in the agricultural industry, report receiving a warm welcome. This undermines existing stereotypes.Many skilled permanent immigrants report strong local connections through sporting, community, school and religious social activities in their regional, rural and remote towns.Those who work in the agricultural industry report a higher level of social engagement — with the exception of sporting activities — than do other immigrants.However, working holidaymakers had more than three times the rate of finalised Fair Work Ombudsman complaints compared to all other workers in 2013-14. This suggests a high incidence of exploitative work arrangements.The research also noted numerous examples over time of exploitation of temporary migrants on temporary student, skilled work, working holiday or Pacific Seasonal worker visas. Examples of co-ethnic exploitation are also common.The research does not clarify the extent to which temporary migrants working in agriculture experience exploitation. However, experiences of migrant worker exploitation do jeopardise future migrant flows into agricultural jobs.International migration decisions are often based on the experiences of friends and family around the world. This means that unscrupulous employers can undermine the benefits of migrant employment programs for the majority of Australian employers who provide appropriate pay and work conditions.Jock Collins is the Professor of Social Economics at UTS Business School.Originally published in The Conversation.","Agricultural Policy, Australia, China, Community and Society, Farm Labour, Federal Government, Immigration, Kiribati, Nauru, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Vegetables, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, ",2016-10-11T20:12:34+00:00

But government funding cuts saw Asian services turned off in January 2015. And now the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has decided to cut the remaining services to residents of remote parts of the Pacific, Papua New Guinea and parts of northern Australia by ceasing its shortwave radio services to the Pacific from the end of January 2017.The ABC has argued the shortwave transmissions, which can travel thousands of kilometres and be picked up by low-cost transmitters run on batteries or solar power, are outdated. Michael Mason, ABC's director of radio said:While shortwave technology has served audiences well for many decades, it is now nearly a century old and serves a very limited audience. The ABC is seeking efficiencies and will instead service this audience through modern technology.The problem is, of course, that in remote places in the Pacific, particularly in Melanesian nations such as Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands, there is no access to an FM signal, limited internet and, where internet is available, it is expensive.Advances in technology such as low-earth orbit satellites, which provide high speed global internet services, show promise. But, as yet, the receiving technology is expensive and the receivers aren't available in rural and remote area.The ABC has said it will replace international shortwave services with digital services including a web stream, in-country FM transmitters, an Australia Plus expats app and partner websites and apps such as TuneIn radio and vTurner.There was no mention of the use of updates to shortwave technologies, such as Digital Radio Mondiale, which is being used by Radio New Zealand, or using shortwave for digital data transmission, which can't be censored or jammed.The move away from shortwave to FM transmissions and digital and mobile services has been accelerated despite the fact that FM frequencies can easily be shut down by disaffected political leaders, as happened in Fiji in 2009 on the order of then self-appointed prime minister Frank Bainimarama.It was a matter of national pride at the time for the ABC to be providing independent information for Fijians via shortwave, with then managing director of the corporation, Mark Scott, highlighting a text message sent from inside Fiji to the ABC, which read: ""We are trying to listen to you online but are having difficulty. Please keep broadcasting. You are all we have""Shortwave radio has played a valuable role in getting information to communities in the middle of civil disturbance, such as in East Timor in the lead up to independence.In Burma, it was internal leaders who sought the shortwave services. In 2009, Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi called on Australia to provide shortwave broadcasts. At the time the ABC's director of international, Murray Green, said the move reflected the ABC's ongoing commitment to serving people in those parts of Asia and the Pacific who live without press freedom. Even before this announcement was made, the price of shortwave radios was increased in Burma's Sittwe market.It isn't just a matter of providing information to censored countries. Shortwave also provides a reliable source of information, particularly during natural disasters.Shortwave provides vital warnings of tsunamis to outlying island nations. It was a lasting communication method after the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, and was vital in the response to 2015's Cyclone Pam, which devastated Vanuatu.Shortwave transmissions go over mountains and seas, have a longer range, and don't fall over and twist in storms like FM radio towers. The Pacific Freedom Forum, a regional media freedom and ethics monitoring and advocacy NGO, said in a statement:It's clear that no thought was given to the link between disaster communications and this service, or even the fact that FM is largely unreliable in bad weather and only available in urban areas.Shortwave is seen as a vital part of keeping communities safe. As an ABC correspondent wrote on their Facebook page, and as technology reporter Peter Marks mentioned on air, after Cyclone Pam:We expected the worst. Death, injury, hunger. But when we arrived, the Dillons Bay village chief ... told me they knew the cyclone was approaching, so they sheltered in the two solid buildings in the village. Most houses were flattened but not a single injury. I asked him how he knew the cyclone was approaching. He said, 'ABC Radio'.The cuts to the shortwave services at the ABC are just the latest in a long line of budget savings to its international services.While other cuts to the broadcaster garnered many headlines, the ABC has cut the shortwave, and also quietly closed its Vietnamese, Khmer and Burmese language services on December 2, 2016. The French-language service to the French Pacific is due to end in February 2017.Thankfully for Pacific nations, while Australia is dialling back its shortwave services, New Zealand's RNZ International is maintaining Pacific-wide shortwave transmission. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has also announced a major boost to its international broadcasts, including producing shortwave radio programmes for North Korea. The BBC is fearful of the rise of state-backed broadcasters such as China's CCTV, Qatar's Al Jazeera, and Russia's RT.The Pacific appears to be a specific concern for China, with Australia's Lowy Institute tracking the extent of China's aid program in the Pacific at more than 200 projects worth $US1.4 billion since 2006 and the state owned Xinhua News Agency actively covering the Asia Pacific.In light of this, the BBC clearly recognises a need to boost its international broadcasting, using shortwave to beat censors in autocratic regimes.It is a great shame for the Pacific that Australia no longer agrees.Alexandra Wake is a senior lecturer in Journalism at RMIT and a former ABC and Radio Australia broadcaster.Originally published in The Conversation.","Asia, Australia, Broadcasting, China, Myanmar, NT, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Radio Broadcasting, Rural, Rural Media, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, ",2016-12-09T06:29:48+00:00

316,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-07/rising-sea-levels-blamed-for-wiping-out-five-islands/7392986,"At least five reef islands in the remote Solomon Islands have been lost completely to sea level rise and coastal erosion, and a further six islands have been severely eroded.Sea level rise, erosion and coastal flooding are some of the greatest challenges facing humanity from climate change.The islands lost to the sea range in size from one to five hectares and supported dense tropical vegetation that was at least 300 years old. Nuatambu Island — home to 25 families — has lost more than half of its habitable area, with 11 houses washed into the sea since 2011.This is the first scientific evidence, published in Environmental Research Letters, that confirms the numerous anecdotal accounts from across the Pacific of the dramatic impacts of climate change on coastlines and people.Previous studies examining the risk of coastal inundation in the Pacific region have found islands can actually keep pace with sea level rise and sometimes even expand.However, these studies have been conducted in areas of the Pacific with rates of sea level rise of 3-5 millimetres per year — broadly in line with the global average of 3 millimetres per year.For the past 20 years, the Solomon Islands have been a hotspot for sea level rise.Its seas have risen at almost three-times the global average — about 7-10 millimetres per year since 1993. This higher local rate is partly the result of natural climate variability.These higher rates were in line with what is expected across much of the Pacific in the second half of this century as a result of human-induced sea level rise. Many areas will experience long-term rates of sea level rise similar to that already experienced in Solomon Islands, but the very lowest emission scenarios.Natural variations and geological movements will be superimposed on these higher rates of global average sea level rise, resulting in periods when local rates of rise will be substantially larger than that recently observed in Solomon Islands. The current conditions in Solomon Islands are an insight into the future impacts of accelerated sea level rise.The coastlines of 33 reef islands were studied using aerial and satellite imagery from 1947 to 2015. This information was integrated with local traditional knowledge, radiocarbon dating of trees, sea level records, and wave models.Wave energy appears to play an important role in the dramatic coastal erosion observed in Solomon Islands. Islands exposed to higher wave energy in addition to sea level rise experienced greatly accelerated loss compared with more sheltered islands.Twelve islands we studied in a low wave energy area of Solomon Islands experienced little noticeable change in shorelines despite being exposed to similar sea level rise. But of the 21 islands exposed to higher wave energy, five completely disappeared and a further six islands eroded substantially.These rapid changes to shorelines observed in Solomon Islands have led to the relocation of several coastal communities that have inhabited these areas for generations. These are not planned relocations led by governments or supported by international climate funds, but are ad hoc relocations using their own limited resources.The customary land tenure (native title) system in Solomon Islands has provided a safety net for these displaced communities. In fact, in some cases entire communities have left coastal villages that were established in the early 1900s by missionaries, and retraced their ancestral movements to resettle old inland village sites used by their forefathers.In other cases, relocations have been more ad hoc, with individual families resettling small inland hamlets over which they have customary ownership.In these cases, communities of 100-200 people have fragmented into handfuls of tiny family hamlets. Sirilo Sutaroti, the 94-year-old chief of the Paurata tribe, recently abandoned his village.""The sea has started to come inland, it forced us to move up to the hilltop and rebuild our village there away from the sea,"" he said.In addition to these village relocations, Taro, the capital of Choiseul Province, is set to become the first provincial capital in the world to relocate residents and services in response to the impact of sea level rise.Interactions between sea level rise, waves and the large range of responses observed in Solomon Islands — from total island loss to relative stability — shows the importance of integrating local assessments with traditional knowledge when planning for sea level rise and climate change.Linking this rich knowledge and inherent resilience in the people with technical assessments and climate funding is critical to guiding adaptation efforts.Solomon Islands National Disaster Council chair Melchior Mataki this ""ultimately called for support from development partners and international financial mechanisms""""This support should include nationally driven scientific studies to inform adaptation planning to address the impacts of climate change in Solomon Islands,"" he said.Last month the Solomon Islands government joined 11 other small Pacific Island nations in signing the Paris climate agreement in New York. There was a sense of optimism it would signify a turning point in global efforts.However, it remains to be seen how the hundreds of billions of dollars promised through global funding models such as the Green Climate Fund can support those most at need in remote communities, like those in Solomon Islands.Simon Albert is a senior research fellow a the University of Queensland School of Civil Engineering, Alistair Grinham is senior research fellow at the University of Queensland, Badin Gibbes is a senior lecturer at the University of Queensland School of Civil Engineering, Javier Leon is a lecturer at the University of the Sunshine Coast, John Church is a CSIRO fellow.This article was first published on The Conversation","Climate Change, Erosion, Oceans and Reefs, Pacific, Sippy Downs, Solomon Islands, University of Queensland, World Politics, ",2016-05-07T00:31:38+00:00

Guadalcanal, Dan Etherington had no idea what would follow.He was visiting Sumate, a typical coastal village in the Solomon Islands, where his work studying the economics of coconuts has started to have a profound impact.As the boat touched sand, a blast from a conch shell broke the silence and four men wielding spears and axes came running menacingly towards Dr Etherington, his son Richard and grandson Chelsea Mosely.It was a traditional warrior's challenge and welcome, a ceremony reserved for the highest honour and a mark of the respect accorded to the 79-year-old Stanford University-educated economist and his family.Dr Etherington has been visiting the Solomon Islands since 1981 when he was an academic and researcher at the Australian National University in Canberra, where he made coconuts his life's work.""As a cash crop, it has been so abused and as an economist I was concerned that you're getting nothing for it,"" he said.""As one of the producers said: 'God is raining money down on us and we don't know it, we don't recognise it.'""It is a money tree but they were not actually getting value for the work that they did.""In the first half of the 20th century, the Solomon Islands was a major producer of copra, the base ingredient used to refine coconut oil for soap production and for cooking oil, but war in the Pacific and health concerns about saturated fat saw the industry severely decline.Copra is part processed at village level, where the coconut flesh is cut from the nut and dried on a rudimentary stove for refining overseas.It is still a mainstay of the Solomon Island's largely subsistence economy, but it is one of the most volatile commodity markets in the world and producers often work for little return.Dr Etherington said copra production was a form of slavery.It's hot, hard, dirty work and the finished product is a poor quality oil that must be cleaned and deodorised after it is refined.About 10 years ago he developed a system called Direct Micro Expelling (DME) for producing virgin coconut oil at village level.It earns at least five times more income than copra and retains the coconut flesh or meal after the oil is cold pressed.""They're producing a beautiful oil and they have a residual meal they can use themselves for cooking, but they can feed their livestock, their chickens and pigs and that's another asset, another thing that helps raise the living standards of the village,"" he said.In the DME system, the coconut flesh is ground and dried and then pressed with a simple low-tech device which Dr Etherington invented after experimenting with a caulking gun.""What we've come up with is the fastest method of producing oil, from the time you open the coconut, till the time you get oil can be in under one hour,"" Dr Etherington said.His company Kokonut Pacific has installed about 40 DME systems in the Solomon Islands and says there is potential to supply up to 300 in the next few years.According to Kokonut Pacific's Solomon Islands manager Bob Pollard, the biggest barrier was cost.The DME systems are worth $23,000, which is a fortune in a country where 85 per cent of the population still live from their own gardens and what they catch in the sea.""That's a problem — banks aren't able to lend to people in villages, they don't have security, financial records, so this is a major obstacle our industry faces, the financial entry barrier,"" Mr Pollard said.The Australian Government has been working with Westpac and the ANZ to roll out mobile phone banking technology in the Solomon Islands — particularly to rural women.""In the last year alone that's enabled 10,000 rural women to open bank accounts for the first time,"" Australia's High Commissioner Andrew Byrne said.""We're also working with the World Bank rural development program, which is giving people alternative sources of livelihood so they can raise a bit of capital, they can do things like start savings clubs and start to do things that we would consider normal basic financial services for the first time.""Commissioner Byrne said investor confidence was returning to the Solomon Islands after ethnic tribal unrest crippled the economy at the beginning of this century.The regional peacekeeping operation has been downscaled to training and advice for local police.A virgin coconut oil industry could deliver important social and economic benefits for the Solomon Islands, according to Mr Byrne.""Potentially it's a really positive thing if this technology can give young rural people a source of livelihood that they wouldn't otherwise have in their village,"" he said.""It reduces the incentive to drift into places like Honiara where often they're unemployed, they're hanging around unable to find employment here and become frustrated and turn to things like alcohol and crime, so potentially it has a really positive social impact right across the country.""Dr Etherington recently visited Honiara to open a coconut technology training centre, which is wholly funded by Kokonut Pacific's profits.The company is run as a social enterprise and has sold its DME technology in a dozen other countries.""We've only got five shareholders and they get enormous rewards out of the success of what we're doing, rather than look for dividends, you get better dividends elsewhere but we've been very profitable and it's those profits which enable us to grow,"" Dr Etherington said.The company has been riding a surge of popularity for coconut oil products, which has challenged the advice of national dietary guides in countries like Australia and the United States, which continue to recommend limited consumption because of links between saturated fat and heart disease.","Business,

The chief secretary to government, Manasupe Zurenuoc, made the promise after receiving even more reports on the drought affecting Mt Wilhelm, Chimbu province, and the frost disaster in Tambul-Neblyer in Western Highlands province.""I've never seen anything like it here in the highlands,"" said Blossum Gilmour, assistant country director of CARE International in PNG.""But we know the same thing happened during the last devastating El Nino experience in 1997.""PNG is especially vulnerable given that around 80 per cent of food consumed in the country is grown in this region.""Officials in Solomon Islands are calling for water rationing as drought conditions prevail there, especially in the northern provinces.In Western Province and its capital Gizo, people are queuing until the early hours of the morning to get water.The premier of Western Province, George Solingi Lilo, said if the conditions continue for more than a month, ""all services in Gizo will have to come to a halt.""""Schools would looking to the possibility of suspension for a while because even water for cooking is a problem, drinking water is a problem, people are even rationing mineral water in shops,"" he told Pacific Beat.Mr Lilo said water infrastructure and aging pipes that sees the loss of up to 60 per cent of its flows is a major contributor to the city's problems.He has called upon the national government to bring long-promised infrastructure renewal back into the frame, as its delisting as a priority has seen an escalation of the drought's effects.Local media said a meeting had taken place between the Western provincial government and disaster stakeholders to address the situation this week.The dry, cold conditions affecting hundreds of thousands of people in large areas of PNG and Solomon Islands will continue throughout this year's El Nino event, said the director of PNG's National Weather Service, Sam Mahia.""There will be impacts in the rural areas where 85 per cent of Papua New Guinea's population resides,"" he said.Mr Mahia said that even with three months warning of an emerging El Nino pattern and drought, the event has already been a disaster and has put to rest any suggestion that this year's warnings were a repeat of last year's false alarm.The deputy director of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Centre in Washington DC, Mike Halpert, said this year's event could even be one of the large impact events that roll around every 15 years or so.""What we can say with confidence is that we have a strengthening El Nino, it's going to continue for the next couple of months,"" he said.The full forecast released by NOAA's Climate Prediction Centre last week called this year's event ""significant and staggering"".The effects could rival the 1997 event which saw devastating weather crises strike countries across the globe including mudslides and droughts in Indonesia, fires across Australia, flooding across the US, and was blamed for virus break outs throughout Africa.","Agricultural Crops, Drought, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Weather, ",2015-08-19T05:18:07+00:00

Three years ago, after cultivating a few seeds from a single yam, Graham Daniels embarked on a new farming endeavour in the Tanolui community of Vanuatu's Shefa province. It proved so successful he is now harvesting three times a year, selling out of stock at the local market and sharing his expertise with others. Pauliane Bafil, a project coordinator with the UN Development Program (UNDP), is working with Mr Daniels and other farmers on a new knowledge-exchange scheme being rolled out in Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Fiji.Ms Bafil said the creation of knowledge hubs allowed individual farmers who had advanced knowledge, farming methods and resilient plant varieties that others might not have access to, to collaborate with each other.The networks brought these farmers together to share their successes and failures, encouraging them to share information, planting materials and to work together to trial sustainable or climate-resilient farming systems.Moortaza Jiwanji, the Pacific risk resilience program manager with the UNDP's Pacific Centre, said sharing knowledge strengthened the resilience of farming communities because they were experimenting with more techniques like mixing crops. ""If they're only growing one crop variety, they're very vulnerable. Whereas if you have a variety of crops, you enhance resilience for those communities,"" he said.""Another area is where people are actually sharing the [seedlings], so it's not just an exchange of information and techniques.""Mr Jiwanji said farmers saw the knowledge hubs as an opportunity and source of confidence.""Beforehand I think they were really struggling, but this is now an opportunity, a sign of hope for communities to actually come out of that by pooling together."" Mr Jiwanji said the challenges of climate change meant this sort of regional cooperation was more important than ever before.""We've all seen the headlines after Tropical Cyclone Pam that hit Vanuatu in March ...  The stories about how communities, particularly remote communities, really didn't have anything to eat in the aftermath of the disaster — particularly green leaf produce,"" he said.""That's a pattern we're seeing with extreme weather events. Now with climate change and more slow-onset events, like extended periods of drought and dry periods, it's reducing farming communities' ability to grow crops."" With growing support from local government and national agriculture ministries, there is speculation the hubs will develop new commercial and export ventures for the region. ""Right now a lot of the focus on subsistence farming and this is still very early days,"" Mr Jiwanji said.""Certainly, these are much more organised approaches and I think there's huge prospects for farming communities to connect better with government [and] also the private sector.""They could become a source for feeding the supply chain.""There are already four knowledge hubs in Vanuatu and eight in Solomon Islands.

That's why the consultation process must be done in all our provinces.""A key issue raised at the consultation was that some of the police involved in the deadly ethnic tensions are still in the force, a situation Mr Vavanga hopes will be firmly addressed.It follows statements by representatives of Isabel province, during consultations there, that they only trust the foreign intervention forces RAMSI and the PPF, due to leave Solomon Islands in mid-2017.Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) assistant commissioner Gabriel Manelusi said most of the police officers involved in the violence had retired, and the community needs to learn to trust their own force.""It was a totally different force altogether,"" Mr Manelusi said of the police before and during the tensions.""Seventy to 80 per cent of the RSIPF force has been recruited after the tensions.""The importance here is that the people of Solomon Islands should know well that the RSIPF is owned by them, they should have trust in their own force.""They should understand that Solomon Islands is a sovereign nation, and it has been very important that RAMSI has come in for the past 12 years and provided capacity training at the highest standard.""Under the re-armament project, firearms will be limited to only three, high-threat environment units within the RSIPF: the Police Response Team, Close Personal Protection Unit and airport police.The units will only be issued firearms after they meet RSIPF endorsed standards based on those of the Australian Federal Police.Mr Vavanga said a permanent police presence on the border with Papua New Guinea's Bougainville is also a necessity.""There are also guns spilling across into our country, that's why the border must be protected,"" he said.Mr Manelusi said there are safeguards in place.""Actually there has been a bilateral arrangement on that issue and we try to integrate together,"" he said of RSIPF's cooperation with Papua New Guinean police.Another issue raised by the Guadalcanal premier was a claim that guns have been hidden from a decade-long attempt to completely remove them from the community.Mr Manelusi said his force continually appeals to the community to inform them of weapons, but few are reported.""That is a problem. They [the community] raise a lot of issues but they they don't come to warn the police, to address this issue,"" he said.""It is therefore important that the community has to work closely in partnership with the police, that is the focus of the new commissioner and his crime prevention strategy.""The assistant commissioner said the consultations, being stage one of the re-armament process, were just the beginning.""If we see the community has the trust with the RSIPF, and the government says okay, we'll move to stage two,"" he said.""It depends entirely on the mindset of the people, and if the people of Solomon Islands are really eager to understand the sovereignty of their nation, that is the way forward.""","Crime, Law, Crime and Justice, Pacific, Police, Solomon Islands, Unrest, Conflict and War, ",2015-06-04T04:32:00+00:00

This creates a sound barrier underwater that drives the mainly spinner and spotted dolphins towards shore where they are killed.Researchers said while the hunt did not pose a threat to the species, it did have the potential to wipe out small and isolated dolphin communities.""We've learned over the years that many populations of dolphins are highly subdivided,"" co-author Scott Baker, from Oregon State University, told Pacific Beat.They'd like to continue the tradition into the future and that might not be possible if they're overexploiting local populations.""That is, they're localised around islands forming small communities. It's the loss of those communities that is the threat here.""Dr Baker said village leaders in South Malaita were receptive to ideas that would protect the resource. ""They'd like to continue the tradition into the future and that might not be possible if they're overexploiting local populations,"" he said.Dive hunting was first documented in the Solomon Islands during the early 20th century, the report states. But it remains unclear when and where the hunt was initiated or introduced into the culture.Oral history from Fanalei village suggests it might have stopped with the arrival of Christianity around the middle of the 19th century.But, according to the study, it was revived in 1948, and by the mid-1960s several thousand dolphins were being killed every year. In 2010, a US-based conservation group attempted to stop the dolphin cull by offering villagers cash in exchange for foregoing the annual hunt.The Earth Island Institute was prepared to hand over $US200,000 — over several years — to two villages in South Malaita: Fanalei and neighbouring Walande.It was hoped the money would be used as capital to develop sustainable industries and create jobs.But instead the cash created tension.""What happened was the funds never made it to the villagers,"" Mark Berman, an associate director at Earth Island Institute, said.The conservation group maintains the money was transferred to the bank accounts of village representatives in the capital Honiara but that it was not passed on to those in the Malaita community where the hunting takes place.""Most of it [the money] just basically vanished,"" Mr Berman said.Most of it [the money] just basically vanished.At the time there were deep divisions between the village and Honiara-based representatives.By 2013, the hunt resumed after villagers claimed the green group had failed to deliver on its promises.""The fact that they claim we're the ones who were the bad guys to renege is totally bogus and is wrong,"" Mr Berman said. ""They're the ones who created the mess themselves.""Mr Berman said in hindsight it was naive to think cash incentives would be effective.""Cash was not the answer,"" he said.""But we went back to them and made one more offer to do 'in-kind donations' [equipment for water treatment, housing construction and small business].

The match between New Caledonia and Samoa was played at high speed, in hot conditions, and to my eyes revealed that women's soccer has gone to another level in the Pacific.New Caledonia is the regional powerhouse, the silver medallist from four years ago, and in Christelle Wahnawe they have the best player in the region.Mele Soakai ... She's only 15, and she's scored a goal in senior international football.

We're here for a reason, to win a medal,"" she said.""We have good development in Samoa, but we need the involvement of the overseas players to take that next step.""Leota and her fellow expats in the Samoan team are very proud to be involved.""It's a privilege for us to be able to represent our little nation, Samoa, and showing the local players there is more to football than just playing other Pacific teams.""But the Samoan policy is not for everyone, with Tonga's coach Lui Muavesi pointedly remarking ""that most of their players are New Zealanders"" when referring to the Tongans' defeat by their Pacific rivals earlier in the tournament.

It had hoped membership would give it greater diplomatic recognition and focus more attention on human rights abuses committed by the Indonesian military and police. But the leaders of the five members of the MSG decided at their summit in Honiara to give the movement observer status instead. We might not be a full member of the MSG, but a door has opened to us. We will sit across a table from Indonesia as equal.The MSG's members are Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia's independence movement FLNKS (Front de Liberation Nationale Kanak et Socialiste).The group was formed in 1986 to support the decolonisation process and help regional liberation groups, but has since evolved into a regional body discussing trade and security issues.The West Papuan representatives at the MSG summit had an opportunity to put their views on their new status in the final plenary session.ULMWP secretary-general Octavianus Mote put a positive spin on the development, saying the diplomatic recognition would help them to focus international attention on human rights abuses in the province.""For 53 years we have endured the most severe human rights violations — torture, killing, disappearance, rape, arbitrary arrest and detention — that the lives of at least 500,000 people have been taken, women, children and men,"" he said.""That is why today is so important to us.""We might not be a full member of the MSG, but a door has opened to us. We will sit across a table from Indonesia as equal.""However, Indonesia's membership of the MSG was upgraded from observer status to associate membership, giving it a greater say in Melanesian politics than the West Papua grouping.Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama, who had already put his view that Indonesia should be granted membership before the summit, said his vote was guided by ""a number of overriding principles in approaching the West Papuan issue"".""The first and foremost of this is that Indonesian sovereignty over West Papua cannot be questioned,"" he said.""The province is an integral part of Indonesia, so when we deal with West Papua and its people, MSG has no choice but to deal with Indonesia, and in a positive and constructive manner.""He also said his decision was made in light of what he thought would help the West Papuans most.Indonesia's official representation on the MSG will be the governors of Indonesia's five Melanesian provinces, known externally as West Papua.Indonesian president Joko Widodo's move in May to remove reporting restrictions in Papua was seen as a sign that Jakarta was easing its tight grip on the mineral-rich province, where poorly armed fighters have for years fought a low-level insurgency against the central government.Mr Widodo has taken a keen interest in Papua, pledging to improve livelihoods in the heavily-militarised area which lags behind other parts of Indonesia in terms of development.Jakarta took control of Papua, which forms half of the island of New Guinea, in 1963 from former colonial power the Netherlands.A Papua New Guinea politician who has been very vocal in support of the West Papuan cause said the inclusion of both the United Liberation Movement for West Papua and the governors in the Melanesian Spearhead Group was a clever move.Gary Juffa, governor of PNG's Oro province, said he did not trust Indonesia's motives, and believed West Papua was a free nation under Indonesian occupation.But he told Radio Australia's Pacific Beat program that all parties now being part of the MSG might encourage positive dialogue.""It gives ULMP a little bit of what they want,"" Mr Juffa said.""It's a foot in the doorway, so they aren't shut out, and that's good.""It also recognises and accommodates Indonesia as a sovereign nation, as it is recognised by the rest of the world.""Even though the manner in which they have acquired West Papua was illegal, they are still recognised as a sovereign state and West Papua is a territory of theirs.""Mr Juffa said there was always a need for dialogue and the MSG is a platform on which to have it.Another strong West Papua supporter, Fiji's influential Methodist Church, believes the inclusion of both the ULMWP and Indonesia could turn out to be a positive one.Reverend James Bhagwan, secretary for communication and overseas missions for the Methodist Church, said while there were clearly problems with the decision, it may lead to political progress for the West Papuans.Mr Bhagwan said the church had long been concerned about human rights abuses in West Papua, and it remained a key concern.""Will what has happened alleviate that, or bring those human rights violations to a close?"" he said.""Or open the door for MSG members to go in with a peace keeping force or some sort of support to assist the West Papuans, who are suffering.""","Colonialism, Forms of Government, Government and Politics, Indonesia, Pacific, Papua, Solomon Islands, Unrest, Conflict and War, ",2015-06-27T02:21:52+00:00

""So, the short term recovery efforts are well in hand, but the longer term recovery efforts - including restoring their economy which has been so badly battered by the impact of this cyclone - will be the centre of discussions.""International help has poured into Vanuatu in the 11 days since Cyclone Pam devastated the archipelago.The United Nations said it had raised around $10 million, as well as bilateral support form neighbouring countries.On Tuesday it launched an urgent appeal for nearly $30 million more to provide life-saving assistance, including food, water, health care and shelter to people in all of the affected areas, covering 22 of Vanuatu's 80 islands.Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Birch is leading the Australian Defence Force recovery team in Vanuatu. He told ABC's The World the ADF team is facing challenges getting to some of the more remote islands, but military assets in the archipelago were getting help to many who had been isolated.""The Defence Force is gladly committing resources to help one of our closest neighbours,"" Lieutenant Colonel Birch said.""We're moving food stores, humanitarian assistance products such as hygiene kits and medical stores.""But also we've got some elements of army engineers here and they're really good at assisting to clean up roads and to open roads for access to some of these areas.""They're doing some assessments on buildings to make sure they're safe, particularly things like schools so that we can return life to a bit of normalcy.""In a happy tale of survival, or sheer luck, seven men caught up in bad weather caused by Cyclone Pam have washed up in Solomon Islands after 13 days adrift.The men from Papua New Guinea said they had been transporting cargo for the Ministry of Agriculture between the islands of Misima and Woodlark in PNG's eastern Milne Bay Province when their small boat ran out of petrol.They did not have a GPS or even any life jackets on board, surviving on raw sweet potato and rain water.The fibreglass outboard motorboat drifted more than 500 kilometres before washing up on Rendova Island, in the Western Province of Solomon Islands.The acting head of PNG's High Commission in Honiara, Tommy Angau, told Radio Australia's Pacific Beat a representative of Papua New Guinea's defence force had spoken with them.""They are all in good condition after they were rescued,"" he said.""We are preparing for them to be flown to Honiara.""Then on Saturday, they will be flown to Port Moresby and then to Misima.""Vanuatu's two communications companies, Telecom Vanuatu and Digicel, said they had now restored 80 per cent of the country's network.Simon Fraser, the chief executive of Digicel Vanuatu, said its national network was restored in just five days.He told Pacific Beat it was not an easy task but the company expected to bring up several more towers in the next couple of days.""It's critical that people are able to communicate with their friends and families after something like the cyclone, so right now we're very pleased with what we've been able to do to date,"" he said.Mr Fraser said not much could be done in the face of a category five cyclone to prevent damage.""We've built considerable resilience into our network prior to the cyclone,"" he said.""But when the cyclone hit, it can take out full cell sites.""We've had, for instance, one of our powers in Erromango completely destroyed, actually knocked to the ground, and that was a 50-metre steel tower built very, very strongly.""So we're starting to work on what additional resilience we can build into our network.""Meanwhile, the UN's children's fund said schools have officially reopened, but 80 per cent of school buildings were damaged in the storm.However, it warned children, especially those in the hardest-to reach islands, were in serious danger.UNICEF's Pacific Representative Karen Allen said in a statement there was a ""significant risk of disease"" due to the acute water shortages, limited medical care and poor sanitation.","Cyclones, Defence and National Security, Disaster Relief, Disasters and Accidents, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, ",2015-03-25T00:59:12+00:00

They wanted to know what was happening in the outside world.""They reported that they had about a week's supply of fresh water left [and] their food stocks had been damaged and were running low.""CARE Australia's Tom Perry said the destruction was widespread.""The impression they got from their initial observations was that the damage is significantly worse than Port Vila,"" he said.He said the hospital was functioning but did not have a roof.Air Taxi Vanuatu pilot Simon Turner described the situation in Tanna as ""dire"".""The bush has been completely decimated, what used to be lush green bush now looks like a bushfire has raged through it and it is now just brown,"" Mr Turner said.""There has been wide-scale destruction of houses, gardens, crops, water contamination.""I imagine there is a little bit of desperation, but they will be doing what they can, huddling where there is shelter and in the churches, schools, any buildings that are still standing, still have their roofs.""Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said reconnaissance by Australia's military ""confirmed significant damage in the southern islands"".""Particularly Tanna island, where it appears that more than 80 per cent of houses and buildings have been partially or completely destroyed,"" she said.""Not only buildings flattened, but palm plantations, trees. It's quite a devastating sight.""Ms Bishop announced the Federal Government would send an additional team of 54 search and rescue personnel to assist in the clean-up.Health Minister Sussan Ley said protecting the health of the population following the disaster was a critical part of the response and recovery effort.She said 20 Australian medical staff — including doctors, nurses, and paramedics — would leave for Vanuatu today.The group, from the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre in Darwin, will work out of the car park of the Port Vila Hospital where they will treat 40 patients a day.""They'll be working out of tents, whilst they're good tents, they're still tents,"" the centre's director of disaster Matthew Harper said.""It will be hot, it will be humid, it will be difficult living conditions.""We're not 100 per cent sure where we'll be sleeping.""Mr Natuman said while initial assessors had been able to enter the eastern and western parts of the island chain, northern and southern areas were still largely inaccessible.""It'll be at least a week or two. Right now we are sending teams to do ground assessments to see how many people are homeless,"" he told reporters at Port Vila airport, where he welcomed home Mr Lonsdale from Japan.Speaking to media with tears in his eyes, Mr Lonsdale expressed his sorrow to the victims of the storm but noted their resilience in the wake of the disaster.When asked about climate change, Mr Londsale said he had noted weather changes in the Pacific nation.Benjamin Shing, from Mr Lonsdale's office, said survivors would quickly run out of food.""The first week we are relying on the fact that the food crops and the gardens are still edible and they can be used for the first week, but after the first week we'll need to get some rations on the ground,"" he told the ABC.Food security is likely to be a continual problem and we need to start thinking now about how children will stay well fed.With crops wiped out, Mr Shing feared the worst for a country that largely relies on subsistence farming, warning ""there might be a lot of fatalities"".The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a situation report ""there are 24 confirmed fatalities"" across Vanuatu so far and some 30 injured. But that figure was later revised down by the UN to 11.Mr Perry said at least five of the dead were from Tanna.Local woman Sale Chilia said residents living in Mele, a village two kilometres south of Port Vila, were starting to worry about where they could find their next meal.""We only have the leftovers now,"" she said.In Port Vila, access to water and electricity was partially restored after the storm brought down an estimated 80 per cent of power lines and damaged most homes.Some stores began reopening, but entire neighbourhoods remained without power as locals struggled to rebuild their homes.In the capital, leaves and branches lined the streets while residents began clearing metal roof sheeting from the roads around their houses and used machetes to hack through fallen trees.Personal belongings, household items, mattresses and clothes were spread out on the ground and hung on washing lines as people dried them out.The cyclone sounded like a big plane flying very low.Samuel Toara, 25, thought he was going to die when the storm barrelled ashore.He sheltered in the pitch black with two other young men as the tempest roared past his home.""It was very hard,"" he said. ""The cyclone sounded like a big plane flying very low.""As heavy rain pounded his house, made of corrugated metal and timber, part of the roof blew off.""The rain and wind was like white smoke and it flooded up to my knee,"" he said.""But I told the boys, don't worry about the water. As long as we survive.""The UN said there were at least 3,300 people sheltering in 37 evacuation centres around the country.UNICEF estimated that 60,000 children have been affected by the cyclone and virtually all schools were closed.But Save the Children said it was trying to get about 45,000 Vanuatu children back into classrooms.""We'll begin working with schools and the government of Vanuatu and other agencies to start rebuilding schools so that children can get back to class as soon as possible,"" spokesman Evan Shuurman said.""We'll be training teachers to provide specialised psycho-social support to children to help them recover from the distress.""AFP/ABC","Australia, Cyclones, Disaster Relief, Disasters and Accidents, Emergency Incidents, Emergency Planning, Kiribati, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, ",2015-03-17T14:33:36+00:00

In addition to the two dozen confirmed dead, more than 30 people have been injured according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).The latest fatalities included a teenage boy and his mother killed by flying debris and two women who were killed when they were crushed by the wall of a church they were sheltering in.Director of the prime minister's office, Benjamin Shing, said aerial assessments of parts of Shefa province showed salt water had swept across the populated area.Flights over Vanuatu's southern island of Tanna also confirmed widespread destruction of houses and crops, with aid agencies saying conditions are among the most challenging they have ever faced.""There will be extensive injuries if the people didn't go to higher ground and there might be a lot of fatalities,"" Mr Shing said.He said up to 70 per cent of the country's population may have been displaced by Cyclone Pam and many parts of the island chain remained cut off from phone lines.Vanuatu's population of more than a quarter of a million had been living in 69,000 households.Donations can be made to the Australian Red Cross Tropical Cyclone Pam Appeal on their website""And out of the 69,000, we are saying that 70 per cent is displaced,"" Mr Shing said.He said there may be enough food for a few more days and then people would be dependent on aid to survive.Vanuatu's prime minister Joe Natuman said communication infrastructure had been badly affected and there was still no communication services across the country.""Communication providers are doing their best to install telephone links throughout the country and they have done that yesterday and today and they assured me today that they will probably install communication by this week,"" he said.The country's biggest mobile phone company Digicel said it had restored its network in the capital.While thousands await aid, Australians who were in the cyclone-struck nation made the journey home.Three flights carrying hundreds of tourists and Australians who worked in Vanuatu landed in Brisbane last night.Charlene Spiteri, who described Cyclone Pam like being at the gates of hell, thanked the Government for bringing her and others home so quickly.""I'm very proud to be Australian today because they did so well to get us out,"" she said.""I'm glad to be home with family and to let people know that we're fine.""But Ms Spiteri said she felt for those who call Vanuatu home.""It's really sad for those people,"" she said.""They are so friendly and they were worried about the tourists.""All schools in Vanuatu have been destroyed or damaged by Tropical Cyclone Pam, the United Nations said.The United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF) said it would set up safe spaces for children to continue with their basic education but said around 17,000 children under the age of five were at risk of poor health and malnutrition after the disaster.""Children unable to attend school are vulnerable. Children need psychosocial support following the cyclone and its aftermath,"" UNICEF said in a statement.UNICEF said it was also working with Vanuatu's government on water and sanitation and had begun distributing supplies to affected areas.We've had aerial surveillance... all we can tell is what we suspected, that everything's destroyed, but we don't know what's happening with the people right nowAid organisation CARE estimated 85 per cent of all houses in Port Vila were destroyed.It said the main water tanks in the capital Port Vila were empty and the city's power supply had been damaged.UNICEF said health centres, including the main hospital, had been damaged and patients had been moved to a new outpatient area.Red Cross Vanuatu chief executive Jacqueline de Gaillarde said shops were already low on supplies because people had stockpiled food before the storm but those supplies were then lost when homes were destroyed.It said its technicians would now focus on the other main population centres like the rest of Efate island, Tanna and Santo.Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office said Pam would have long-term effects on the livelihoods of the large number of local farmers, and have a major impact on the nation's food security.""Most of these people depend mainly on subsistence farming, so they lost most of their crops and some of them especially in rural areas ... might lose income,"" operations manager Peter Korisa told the ABC. ""So the priority is how they can resume back to their normal life and how they can sustain their life and maintain food security in those communities.""Authorities in Vanuatu are still struggling to establish contact with outer islands that bore the brunt of Pam's winds.The southern island of Tanna, about 200 kilometres south of Port Vila, with its 29,000 inhabitants took the full force of the storm.Initial reports from aid groups said it had been devastated, along with the main town on the southern island of Erromango, with at least two people reported dead.Aurelia Balpe, head of the Pacific office of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said it appeared Tanna had suffered widespread damage.She said a local Red Cross volunteer had been ""traumatised"" by the cyclone's intensity.""He sounded like he was in shock and we couldn't get very much information from him, just that there was devastation,"" Ms Balpe said.Save the Children's Vanuatu director Tom Skirrow said that aid agencies were preparing supplies but it would likely be three days before airfields in remote islands were cleared.""We've had aerial surveillance ... all we can tell is what we suspected, that everything's destroyed, but we don't know what's happening with the people right now,"" Mr Skirrow said.Relief flights have begun arriving in the battered Port Vila with rice, bottled water and medical kits given to more than 1500 people.But workers on the ground said there was no way to distribute desperately needed supplies across the archipelago.""Things in Port Vila are improving, people are returning to the market and getting on with the job of starting the clean-up,"" said Tom Perry, from CARE Australia.""But the key thing is we still have no contact with other provinces.

364,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-16/solomon-islands-landowners-challenge-logging-approval-kolombanga/6091994,"A logging company majority-owned by Solomon Islands' forestry minister is facing a legal challenge from landowners keen to protect the cloud forest on Kolombangara Island.The ground-breaking case has been in and out of the courts for five years and is due for its next appearance soon.It has been a long and tortuous road for the landowners who first brought legal action in 2010 to prevent Success Company Ltd logging cloud forest on the slopes of Kolombangara's imposing volcanic mountain.Kolombangara is home to around 6,000 people who live mostly in villages scattered around the coast of the island's single jungle-clad cone. The cloud forest is a special kind of rainforest which grows above 400 metres.The rare Western Province ecosystem is a source of food and water and contains cultural sites as well as species found nowhere else in the world.Success Company Ltd is 60 per cent owned by Heinz Horst Bodo Dettke, who was re-appointed the country's forestry and research minister after elections in November.In 2009, the company started logging in the cloud forest in an area called Lot 1. The legal action began in 2010 after members of the Kolombangara Island Biodiversity and Conservation Association (KIBCA) discovered the firm had failed to prepare an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and had not obtained a Development Consent from the government or the required permission for logging above 400 metres. Kolombangara Forests Products Limited (KFPL), another company active on the island, holds a lease including land up to the rim of the island's 1770-metre peak, but it plants and cuts plantations. After obtaining Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification in 1998, KFPL agreed to restrict its activities to below 400 metres.KIBCA, which is largely funded as a part of KFPL's social and environmental commitments program, took its complaint to the High Court, where Success argued the association lacked standing to make a claim because it was a group representing landowners and not a landowner itself.In August 2010, Justice David Chetwynd rejected the company's argument and granted an injunction stopping the chainsaws that were felling trees in Lot 1.This was the first injunction of its kind granted in Solomon Islands and the decision to recognise KIBCA set a significant precedent. ""This was important because it paves the way for other landowners and environmental groups to challenge decisions that are contrary to environmental laws,"" said Stephanie Price, an Australian lawyer who worked on the case.Solomon Islands has a long history of local communities complaining of unfavourable and unsustainable agreements with logging companies.In August 2010, Mr Dettke was elected to parliament and appointed as the minister for forestry, a position he held for just a few months before being sacked and allocated another portfolio.The following month, then-commissioner for forests Reeves Moveni granted approval for Success's logging on Kolombangara above 400 metres.The case went back to the High Court in November, with Justice Chetwynd extending his injunction against logging, but only pending the granting of all the proper approvals. Success was granted a development consent in March 2011 by Joe Horokou, the director of the environment and conservation division of the ministry of environment, completing the approval process.But the Kolombangara Biodiversity and Conservation Association was told nothing of this.In June 2011, KIBCA welcomed then-prime minister Danny Phillip to Kolombangara, celebrating his decision to dedicate all of the 20,000 hectares above 400 metres as a ""special area for conservation"". The declaration, however, lacked any legal clout.When KIBCA found out about the approvals in July 2011, it filed an appeal to the Environmental Advisory Committee against the director's decision to grant the development consent. That appeal is still waiting for the attention of the Environmental Advisory Committee, which has drifted apart and does not hold meetings.In November 2011, KIBCA took new legal action challenging the government decision-making process, by applying to the High Court for the quashing of the approval for logging over 400 metres and the development consent. This is the case that is scheduled for hearing in April. If the court cases were fast and the companies were punished for not following the law then the system would work. But that's not how it is.Success has given an undertaking in court that it will not continue logging on Lot 1 until the case is heard.In August 2012, the attorney-general, representing Mr Moveni and Mr Horokou, filed a defence rejecting KIBCA's claim.The grinding pace of the legal process is frustrating the Kolombangara Island Biodiversity and Conservation Association.""If the court cases were fast and the companies were punished for not following the law then the system would work. But that's not how it is,"" KIBCA coordinator Ferguson Vaghi said.""The good thing [about the legal action] ... is that it has slowed down the logging activities and it has given us time to work on more permanent solutions.""Martha Manaka, senior legal officer with the Solomon Islands government's Landowners' Advocacy and Legal Support Unit (LALSU), says that pursuing the case through the courts is important because it ""sets a precedent"" in how companies deal with gaining consent for logging and other activities. LALSU and KIBCA are hoping for a favourable outcome but they know winning the court case does not guarantee long term protection. ""Even if the case succeeds and the High Court declares that the existing Development Consent and 400 metres approval are invalid, the director of environment and the commissioner of forests could just grant those consents again,"" Ms Price said.KIBCA's new plan of action is to get the area above 400 metres designated as a national park under the Protected Areas Act 2010, which would make it illegal for the director and commissioner to grant approvals for logging.This is a difficult process because it requires all of the landowners to give consent, and there are some Kolombangara people who, with few income-earning opportunities, see ""locking up forests"" as akin to giving them away for no return.""It's a local mentality that can be overcome by doing what we are doing,"" Mr Vaghi said. ""We are used to depending on the forest for almost everything, so if we are going to stop people from making money from the forest we have to find incentives and offer alternatives.""Mr Vaghi suggests other ways of monetising the forest, such as eco-tourism, agro-forestry, honey production and other sustainable industries. KIBCA is also challenging this mentality by awarding scholarships covering the cost of secondary schooling, in exchange for approvals from parents who feel they are being forced to choose between protecting the forest and educating their children.Attempts were made to contact Mr Dettke for comment but he did not respond.Dr Kayt Davies is a senior lecturer in Journalism at Edith Cowan University.

So close to the surface is the deposit, little will grow on the land.""One of the reasons we can bring this to market so quickly ... is because this deposit lies closely to the surface,"" he explained.""The deposit also sits right on the shoreline and that shore encompasses a deep water harbour. Those three aspects combined mean that we can move this to market very quickly.""Not everyone is overjoyed about the development, but opponents are unwilling to appear on camera.They worry about soil run-off during the heavy tropical rains and question whether locals really understand the impact of removing the top layer of their land given the fragile ecosystem.Axiom, however, prides itself on its relationship with the local communities. It has gifted a 20 per cent stake in the company to the two main landowner groups.Mount, a former Sydney stockbroker who took control of Axiom after the Sumitomo legal action looked likely to send it to the wall, has a deep personal connection to the island nation and will live there permanently once development begins. It is a commitment that has been welcomed by locals.""The opportunities for them are not just in equity,"" he said.""We're obviously going to be employing a lot of the locals. We have a policy of employing the local landowner groups and villagers before we go abroad to the market.""There are good reasons for getting local landowners on side. A short drive from the nation's capital, Honiara, sits the Gold Ridge mine which has had a chequered history.Until recently, this operation accounted for 20 per cent of the country's GDP. Now it lies dormant.In April, the Melbourne-based St Barbara evacuated its expatriate workers without notice, on the premise that the island's worst floods in living memory created a security threat.Locals, however, believe the mine was in no danger, given its elevation, and point to the plunging gold price as the real reason.With the wet season approaching, locals fear the tailings dam may spill over, threatening to contaminate local waters with arsenic and cyanide.Dick Douglas from the Gold Ridge Community and Landowners Council said the community is scouting around for interested parties to take over from St Barbara.""If there is an interested Chinese company or any other companies would like to have an interest in the operation at Gold Ridge, then we can have an open door to discuss and have dialogues with any investors,"" he said.The Gold Ridge situation, and the long dormant Panguna copper mine on nearby Bougainville, have created a blue print for Axiom on how not to conduct business.First tested in the 1950s, Axiom secured the lease four years ago. It currently is engaged in baseline studies before beginning development and hopes to be shipping ore in 12 months.Sumitomo had planned to build a processing facility on the site, an undertaking Axiom has shunned, preferring the earlier cash flow to the more capital intensive option of on-site processing.It may be celebration time at Taho Village, but Axiom and its local partners have one final legal hurdle.""Sumitomo have lodged an appeal in the Court of Appeal, which is the highest court in this land,"" Mount explained.""We will deal with that when that comes about and we expect that to come about in February next year. But we're pushing on with this project and we're very confident of defending our rights in the Court of Appeal.""","Australia, Company News, Japan, Mining and Metals Industry, Solomon Islands, ",2014-12-03T06:02:51+00:00

The incident happened near Auki, in the eastern part of the island of Malaita. Police chased the official who dropped the ballot box before escaping into the jungle. A police spokesman said they were investigating whether one of the candidates had ordered the theft. In a separate incident, a supporter of a candidate in the south part of Malaita sustained minor injures when rivals threw stones.

We've got to deliver this intelligence.""I got on the radio and tried to contact Milne Bay.""The proof was not just that Mr Geddes' message was picked up by Australian radio operators.It was heard by the Japanese themselves, who recorded the intercept in their own military archives.Rear Admiral Morison's account was published in 1949 and was immediately picked up by newspapers around the world, including in Australia.""If I printed in tomorrow's newspaper that you were responsible for the deaths of 1,023 sailors, how would you feel?"" Mr Geddes asked.""We were angry and couldn't believe that this could be. We just couldn't believe it.""Australian historians later discounted Rear Admiral Morison's claims, but the false version stands uncorrected in the US.""It was the American people who were fooled,"" said Mr Geddes, who is now in his 90s and has been fighting for 65 years for the record to be corrected.""Now, why would I settle on something here in Australia when the victim was in America, and the American public, they're not aware of what the truth was.""If I printed in tomorrow's newspaper that you were responsible for the deaths of 1,023 sailors, how would you feel?Canberra-based historian Dr Chris Clark, who worked with Commodore Bruce Loxton to write a book about the naval disaster, said Rear Admiral Morison's account was unsourced and wrong.""I don't know where Morison got his information from,"" Dr Clark said.""It's a pretty hard falsehood to tell against the RAAF pilots, or the RAAF crew, and to put it in print, in a form that really lasts a long time, and it's very hard to retract once it's in print.""Mr Geddes even wrote to US president Barack Obama in an attempt to clear the name of the Hudson crew.7.30's original story set in train a series of events that have now led to Mr Geddes receiving a letter from US Navy historians, thanking him for his war service and criticising the account of Rear Admiral Morison.The letter is thanks to the efforts of his former RAAF colleague, Air Marshal David Evans.Air Marshal Evans flew with Mr Geddes in the 1960s and rose to become the RAAF's chief of the air staff.But the first he knew of the Hudson scandal was when he watched 7.30's report.""I was astounded, I rang him up straight away: 'why didn't you get in touch with me before?'""""He said, 'you don't like to burden'.""I said, 'you damn fool'.""The former chief of the RAAF began his own campaign.Thanks to his connections, there has been action within the US Navy.Mr Geddes received a letter from the Naval History and Heritage Command, within the US Department of the Navy.I wanted to be able to assure him that there's a lot of history out there that provides a very different take and interpretation of events regarding the Hudson and sightings.It contains these vital lines: ""A new generation of naval historians is questioning previous works, such as that of Rear Admiral Samuel Eliot Morison, often written too close to the end of a recently completed campaign ... RADM Morison's criticism, in particular, was unwarranted.""The letter is from Greg Martin, the assistant director of the US Naval History and Heritage Command, in Washington.""I wanted to be able to assure him that there's a lot of history out there that provides a very different take and interpretation of events regarding the Hudson and sightings,"" Mr Martin told 7.30.Mr Geddes said he was satisfied with the carefully-worded letter, which proves he was right all along, and stands as a validation of his crew-mates.The last survivor of the Hudson crew has just one regret.""Unfortunately, the wrong thing happened to Morison.

Since the global financial crisis the appetite of bankers for taking unnecessary chances has significantly reduced.To overcome this, countries wanting to offer movable asset loans are passing legislation to set up ""secured transaction"" registers.Any asset pledged against a loan must be listed on the register and cannot be used against another bank loan or sold to anyone else without the bank's permission.But banks also need to change the way they work with their customers and get much more hands-on.In Vietnam, one young single mother using her cashew crops as collateral grew from a small farmer to the CEO of a company with three processing plants.At her warehouse the nervous bank had one lock on the door while she had the other.Those with access to movable asset loans are still the lucky ones.In the Pacific only six nations have set up ""secured transactions"" registers and in Asia not all countries have embraced them.The Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB) is working to increase those numbers with four more registers in the pipeline in the Pacific and other programs in Asia.In many developing countries small to medium-sized (SME) local businesses generate around half of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employment but despite recent efforts only 20 per cent have access to credit.That is a missed opportunity, the ADB's vice president of finance and risk management Thierry de Longuemar told Pacific bankers in Sydney recently.""The under-served and subsequently underdeveloped SME sectors represent missed opportunities for economic growth and poverty reduction,"" he said.Mr Langston at Credit Corp, who is part of a new breed of indigenous bankers eager to provide opportunities to their countrymen, says he is not taking any risks he is not comfortable with.He is urging more staid institutions to join him.""My message to other financial institutions would be 'don't be scared of the secured transaction process,'"" he said.In Solomon Islands one of the more novel assets being put up as collateral is invoices to government departments, which are notorious for serious late-payment of bills.Without the movable asset loans road maintenance companies would grind to a halt.","Asia, Banking, Business, Economics and Finance, Community and Society, Economic Trends, Industry, Pacific, Palau, Poverty, Solomon Islands, Vietnam, ",2014-08-04T12:44:28+00:00

And then when they were confronted with the much more difficult task of training and creating a new police force, of course this was where the problems really started to eventuate, particularly because the then-Australian government of (Prime Minister) John Howard and (Foreign Minister) Alexander Downer believed they had to force these things down the throat of the Solomon Islands government. ""Even if there was no consent about these reforms, they were going to push them ahead regardless of the price to be paid for security sector assistance. This didn't really work.""Professor Fraenkel says when compared to other international security missions, such as in East Timor or Afghanistan, an assessment of the Solomon Islands intervention is mixed.""The comparative cases don't paint a pretty picture. If you look at Iraq, if you look at Afghanistan, if you look at Bosnia, even if you look at Sierra Leone, there are many cases where intervention missions have been very unsuccessful. There have been massive local conflict, police forces have rampaged killing their own citizens.""One has to remember RAMSI commmenced in a very different conflict setting... it was relatively straight forward to disarm the militants and get rid of the guns. So that was widely acclaimed, very popular within the Solomon Islands and a largely successful element of the mission. ""The difficulty was: the method of achieving success in phase one made phase two, the longer term objectives (of security), more difficult.""Those changes can't be imposed from the outside simply as a price to be paid for getting some security assistance, they need some political buy in and genuine cooperation between donors and government representatives.""Many of the personnel employed under RAMSI remain in Solomon Islands under the supervision of Australia, New Zealand or multilateral agencies, but the review looked at RAMSI's presence from 2003 to 2013 and it's long-term impact on Solomon Islands.""There are still serious difficulties with the Solomon Islands police force and many of the achievements (of) performance indicators in the various ministries have been achieved by RAMSI personnel themselves,"" Professor Fraenkel said.""Their impact will continue for some time, but there's not a great degree of evidence that the local civil service has been dramatically up-skilled as a result of this decade of capacity building.""The report, prepared by an independent review team commissioned by Solomon Islands Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo and the Pacific Islands Forum, was presented to Pacific leaders at their summit retreat in Palau on Thursday.","Defence Forces, Defence and National Security, Government and Politics, Pacific, Police, Regional Communities, Security Intelligence, Solomon Islands, ",2014-07-31T09:05:47+00:00

On August 1, 1943, he and Biuku Gasa were patrolling the waters of Solomon Islands near Gizo when they came across Lieutenant John F Kennedy and other US sailors who had swum to Olasana Island after their boat collided with a Japanese destroyer. Kennedy carved a message in the husk of a coconut and the two Solomon Islanders, at great risk, rowed through Japan-patrolled waters to deliver the message to the nearest Allied base. Kennedy and his men were then rescued.American Danny Kennedy is one of those who has tried to make Mr Kumana's story more well known. He has been running a dive shop in Gizo since the 1980s, not far from where Kennedy was rescued. He made a point of putting Mr Kumana in touch with visiting American tourists and journalists when they visited Solomon Islands.""We always tried to give them as much exposure because we were trying to help them and their village and their community have some sort of sustainable livelihood,"" Danny Kennedy told Radio Australia.""For instance, one crew many years ago bought them a dugout canoe and an outboard engine for transportation so they could provide transportation back and forth to the markets.""Mr Kennedy says Mr Kumana remained in good spirits to the end.""Right up until a few weeks back, he was still very agile, still laughing, still very animated,"" he said.""He was someone who when you saw him he really made you feel good. He was one of these people that just had this amazing amount of energy and presence."" Mr Kumana enjoyed the limelight, Mr Kennedy says, and was proud of his role in saving JFK's life.""I think up until he started getting the exposure, he didn't realise how much people appreciated what he had done,"" he said.""He really appreciated the fact that he was being recognised.""Eroni Kumana and Biuku Gasa were both invited to John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961, but a British colonial officer reportedly decided that their English wasn't good enough and prevented them from leaving the Solomon Islands' capital, Honiara.""Even to this day, in the Kennedy diaries, it actually describes that he was visibly distressed when he realised the two guys who had helped save him in the Solomon Islands were not there,"" said Danny Kennedy.Mr Gasa died in November 2005.

It is a fairly high grade by the standard of these low-grade laterites that you see around the world,"" he said.Nickel is a crucial component in stainless steel. The deposit in Isabel Province is thought to be one of the global top 15.Sumitomo has been in Solomon Islands for a decade trying to get permission to explore, and at one stage won an international tender to do so.Axiom Mining got involved more recently after being approached by a group of landowners.Axiom CEO Ryan Mount says he looked at mining failures in Melanesia - at Bougainville and Ok Tedi in Papua New Guinea and at the first iteration of Gold Ridge on Solomon Islands main island - before deciding the bottom-up approach was the way to go.""Essentially we did a lot of research in the region and a lot of history with regards to mining in the Pacific, and in particular Solomon Islands, and we came to the conclusion that a bottom-up approach was more appropriate considering what came out of that research,"" he said.""Essentially you start at the top with the constitution of the Solomon Islands and it is clear that the landowners have a say in just about every activity on their land so from the start we knew we had to include them.""Sumitomo really wasn't in our business plan at all. We were simply dealing with the indigenous landowners. They approached us. Obviously Sumitomo were there, and had been there for quite some time trying to secure the asset.""Axiom formed a joint venture, Axiom KB, with landowners of the Kolosori and Bungusule tribes, giving them a 20 per cent stake in any mining development and a powerful incentive not to agree to mining by any other company.Sumitomo and Axiom KB each claim they hold the legal right to a prospecting licence. Australian Judge, John Brown, is hearing the case.Peter Strachan says Indonesia's decision to ban the export of unprocessed nickel ore is feeding their enthusiasm to develop the resource.""At the moment Indonesia has stopped exporting nickel laterites to China so that has been part of the reason why the nickel price has risen by $2.50 a pound from $6.20 to $8.50 odd a pound,"" he said.""The feeling is whoever owns this deposit is going to be able to mine and ship directly the low-grade oxide nickel to customers in China.""Axiom has a fast-track plan. If it wins the case it could be shipping ore within 12 months.In the 3 years since the dispute began Axiom has put down roots in Solomon Islands with a gold and copper exploration tenement on another island.However, that has not taken any of Ryan Mount's focus away from the nickel resource in Isabel Province.""It is a very valuable asset and we are prepared to defend our rights and support our landowner partners,"" he said.The court case has come at a significant expense to the small Australian miner.""We have obviously had to fund the court case and our overheads in the Solomon Islands. Over the last year I would say it would have pushed into $8 million dollars,"" Mr Mount said.However, he insists the company is still financially secure and able to fund the litigation.""We have always felt comfortable with our position. We obviously have a business plan and we also evaluate the risks and we prepare for those,"" he said.""We obviously went into this case feeling confident or we wouldn't have proceeded with it and, yes, we do feel reasonably confident of the outcome, but we don't want to go talking about that until it is delivered.""While the Japanese and Australian firm fight it out in the Solomon Islands High Court, new companies from China are showing interest.The China Metalurgical Group owns the Ramu Nickel project in Papua New Guinea, a similar nickel laterite deposit.The Executive Director of the PNG Chamber of Mines Greg Anderson says a variety Chinese companies are interested in opportunities in the Pacific.""The Ramu nickel cobalt project was a very big experiment for China - it was one of their biggest mineral investments at the time, overseas, and it hasn't been that easy,"" he said.""It has been a difficult project but I think they see this area as very promising.""It is a big learning curve and the Melanesian countries are very different land wise and with land ownership than the rest of world, so it is an enormous learning curve.""Ramu nickel faced criticism for dumping waste from its PNG mine into the seas in the coral triangle and for not always taking a sympathetic approach in its dealings with traditional landowners.With the recent shutdown of Solomon Islands' only mine, Gold Ridge, Honiara is hoping more than ever for success with other mineral projects.","Australia, China, Company News, Japan, Mining and Metals Industry, Solomon Islands, ",2014-09-08T06:18:40+00:00

""That's why President Obama began what's known as the rebalance to Asia in 2009.""That's why he's asked me to redouble my own efforts in the region over the next two and a half years.""In his speech, Mr Kerry outlined what he says are four key opportunities; creating sustainable economic growth, powering a clean energy revolution, promoting regional cooperation, and empowering people. He identified climate change as the biggest challenge to the region, but says low carbon energy policy offers a solution. Crucial to this US strategy on economic growth are negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which Mr Kerry says are key to the region. ""It's about generating growth for our economies, and jobs for for our people, by unleashing a wave of trade investment and entrepreneurship,"" he said.""It's about standing up for our workers and protecting the environment, and promoting innovation, and it's about reaching high standards to guide the growth of this dynamic regional economy.""All of that is just plain good for businesses, it's good for workers, its good for our economies.Pacific Island nations are not a part of the TPP negotiations, but with many Pacific nations already being affected by rising sea levels - among other effects of climate change - they will likely welcome Washington's focus on the issue.Mr Kerry says sustainable economic development is an important part of the vision for US relations with the region.""Ultimately the true measure of our success will not be just whether our economies continue to grow, but how they continue to grow,"" he said. ""We need to turn today's climate crisis into tomorrow's clean energy revolution.""Climate change is not a crisis of the future, climate change is here and now.""One of the countries on Mr Kerry's itinerary, Solomon Islands, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

The Brisbane based Geodynamics Limited and its joint venture partner Kentor Energy Pty Ltd (a subsidiary of Kentor Gold) told the Australian Stock Exchange the granting of development consent by the Solomon Islands Government follows a review of both their Environmental and Social Impact Assessment and their Environmental Management Plan.""The next key step for us is to undertake exploration drilling on the island to prove the existence of a geothermal reserve capable of supporting the project,"" Geodynamic's chief executive officer Geoff Ward said.

At the moment most of Honiara's power comes from diesel generators, and fuel imports make up about 20 per cent of the Solomon Islands' total import bill.Mr Ward says the company believes it would need at least an initial 10 MW power station to justify the costs of exploration and building the infrastructure.""We're very confident that it will be cheaper than diesel,"" he said.""We anticipate that the cost of diesel will keep going up and the cost of geothermal would remain flat over the life of the project.""Mr Ward says the switch from imported fossil fuel based energy to indigenous renewable energy should free up foreign reserves currently used to pay for diesel imports and so help it will improve the Solomon Islands Balance of Trade.However, that is still a few years away.""If we commence exploration later this year we would hope to be in production in 2018,"" he said.Geodynamics is working on a similar thermal-power exploration project on Efate Island in Vanuatu.

New Zealand paid for its forces.Ms Hayward Jones says that, given Australia's interests in Solomon Islands and the rest of the Pacific at the time, the price tag was ""massive and disproportionate"". ""Australia's interests in Solomon Islands before the time of the conflict were really similar to that of its interests in Vanuatu or other small Pacific Island countries,"" she said.""We saw a massive increase with RAMSI, with the average spend per year during the RAMSI decade being the equivalent of the total Australian aid expenditure in Solomon Islands in the decade prior to RAMSI.""So the cost did really get out of control mainly because there was no clear objective or exit strategy at the beginning.""Ms Hayward Jones says future missions should have an exit strategy based on limited and defined criteria. ""Without an effective exit strategy, or just as importantly a means of measuring the impact and measuring performance, it is very hard to get to a point where you can make those hard political decisions about when it is time to leave and whether we have achieved our objectives,"" she said.

He says the flooding had also led to security concerns.""We also had a number of random acts of violence and vandalism, and we can only see that escalating,"" he said.""Given the situation on the ground in Honiara, we were certain that we could not rely on external assistance to enforce law and order and provide security.

At least 20 people have been killed and families talk about watching children swept out to sea or relatives disappearing.Dozens remain unaccounted for. The floods have caused terrific devastation, especially along the rivers that run through the city. You can also see evidence of that along coast as you drive from the airport into town.  This wreckage along the rivers is just unprecedented - I've been talking to Solomon Islanders who've lived here a long long time, and they're saying the same thing - they've never seen anything like this.The stretch of river along between where the old bridge that stood there for 60 years, but has been swept away, used to be and the main bridge - either side of the river it's just unbelievable to see the damage that's been caused.The traffic is moving at a snail's pace, but the police have been very good, manning the one-lane main bridge - stopping the traffic in one direction and allowing the other direction to go.At the hotel I've booked in to there's a half-capsized boat washed up beside the swimming pool. The water supply has been disrupted to parts of the city and there are worries about the sewerage system - so health is a major concern.

""The situation in the city is that currently there are 12,000 people that have been displaced.""Local resident Paul Lega told the Solomon Star newspaper the river rose too fast for some families to escape.""I witnessed a mother and two children swept away in their home,"" he said as the newspaper described the devastation as ""the worst disaster the nation has seen"".Graham Kenna's colleagues at Save the Children witnessed a child being swept away in the floodwaters, just one of ""several tragedies"" he says his staff have seen in the disaster.Sixteen evacuation centres have been set up throughout the city, most of them in local schools while many other people have sought shelter with family.""It's making it increasingly difficult to register these people and then decide what kind of assistance we need to give them,"" Mr Kenna said.""There was a helicopter fly-over of the outer areas of the city and it's estimated that 37,000 people have been directly impacted by the disaster. ""So you could double that figure by people that are under pressure - maybe they have houses damaged. ""The infrastructure has been extremely badly damaged. Sewage has been broken, there's no water in the city, the water pumping unit is not working properly. We've had sparse electricity, sparse internet, so the infrastructure itself is gone.""The two major bridges in the city are both unusable, one is completely washed away, the other one is damaged and vehicles cannot cross it.""Flights remain suspended at Honiara's Henderson International Airport due to debris on the runway and damage to navigation and lighting systems. Aid workers feared outbreaks of disease in the city and were waiting for Honiara airport to reopen so emergency relief supplies could be flown in.The flooding had cut off roads throughout Honiara and of the two main bridges crossing the Mataniko, one was washed away and the other was closed after large cracks appeared in the structure.The loss of the bridges prevented officials from getting a look at the scale of destruction in outlying areas where landslides and floods were also reported. The Solomon Islands meteorological bureau says the tropical low over the country which has brought three days of heavy rains is slowly intensifying.It has warned residents to take precautionary measures as bad weather associated with the tropical low poses threats to lives and properties.The Australian Government is providing an initial $50,000 in humanitarian emergency assistance for the deadly flooding.The aid will go towards helping the Solomon Islands government and local non-government organisations with logistics and emergency relief items.Australia is also providing specialist assistance to the NDMO and will help the government to undertake an initial aerial surveillance of the damage.The government of New Zealand is providing close to $300,000 in emergency relief.It says the money will be used for relief supplies and shelter for the thousands of people made homeless after heavy rain and flooding.Meanwhile, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has updated its travel advice for the Solomons warning of road closures and delays at Honiara's Henderson International Airport.ABC, wires","Disasters and Accidents, Emergency Incidents, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Storms, ",2014-04-04T22:24:47+00:00

""There's some areas that shouldn't be logged.""Mr Hamilton says there also needs to be work done in relation to logging operations following best international practice.""That happens very rarely in the Asia Pacific region - I think the international body that regulates commercial trade in forestry in Asia Pacific, the ITTO, estimates that only 12 per cent of forests in the Asia Pacific region are currently following best practices. ""So there's two things really - don't log your really, really vulnerable areas...and if you are going to go ahead with logging in some of these less vulnerable areas make sure you follow these international best practices, because that will minimise the impact of sediment downstream.""","Environment, Fishing, Aquaculture, Forestry, Pacific, Solomon Islands, ",2013-11-06T23:24:41+00:00

""There is an assumption that parents allow their daughters to be married.""When you are in a state of powerlessness, what can you do?

But again, the compensation is only to settle the breach that has occurred,"" he said.The compensation does not cater for the upbringing of any children, but Mr Olofia says there is little some  families can do.""The committee is trying to advocate for a change in government policy that makes it hard, that helps us to provide laws for the protection of these kinds of situations for young girls who work in these logging camps,"" he said.","Environment, Forestry, Pacific, Solomon Islands, ",2013-12-03T09:37:24+00:00

So having these provisions about diversion and having a framework of international cooperation and assistance that can support Pacific states to prevent arms from being diverted in the first place is a really significant step forward,"" he said.The Pacific Small Arms Action Group says governments in the Pacific region recognise that small arms are an issue, the biggest challenge, however, is not political commitment but prioritising the issue in an already crowded agenda.""With small government ministries and a lot of challenges facing states, I guess this hasn't come to the forefront as much as it should have,"" Mr Murphy said.He says while the region is typically viewed as a peaceful place, it ""actually hasn't taken a great deal and a great number of arms to destabilise the Pacific.""""We've seen in places like Fiji that the coup that was instigated in 2000, only required a small number of arms to destabilise the region. The same in places like Solomon Islands. And in Bougainville, which was once the most prosperous region of Papua New Guinea, after 10 years of conflict became the poorest.""So we've seen that only a small number of arms has really reversed development gains, undermined human rights and caused serious problems in the region.""By signing on to this arms trade treaty, the Pacific's sending a very clear message that we don't tolerate the mis-use of arms and that we see this as a problem that we want to prevent in the future.""Ben Murphy says there's been political commitment from members of the Pacific Islands Forum on the issue since 2010.""We're going to continue to work with Pacific governments and civil society to push that commitment forward and I think that you'll see over the next 12 months as the momentum for the arms treaty grows, and we already have more than 50 per cent of states in the world have now signed on to this treaty including some of the world's biggest arms exporters like the US, that you will see a great ground swell forward on this.""","Fiji, Kiribati, Law, Crime and Justice, Nauru, Pacific, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Unrest, Conflict and War, ",2013-09-29T22:11:24+00:00

The OFC's General Secretary, Tai Nicholas, says there's no indication of misappropriation by those running the game, and it appears poor accounting is to blame.“For one reason or another the former administration, for the amount of activities they’re involved in both internationally and domestically, weren’t able to fund everything,"" Mr Nicholas said.""The best way forward in order for football to grow in that country is to install a new administration, which was done by FIFA appointing a Normalisation Committee to run the affairs of football, and to call for new elections in a year's time.""""We've concluded lapses in financial management in terms of the accountability of where the money went,"" he said. ""We can't prove there's misappropriation, so the current administration agreed that maybe it was time to install a normalisation for the time being, and look to stakeholders across the Solomon Islands to install a new administration.""Mr Nicholas told Pacific Beat the OFC is keen to take over.""All the money stops at both government level, sponsors, with FIFA and OFC until such time.

That's a lot of money for a football federation and if anything they need help, so collectively FIFA will provide the management support, software and staff so they can get the help they need,"" Mr Nicholas said.""For the sake of their national teams or domestic football, sometimes investment is not put into administration and staffing, which seems to be the only thing that's lacking.""But he's adamant football in the Pacific region is healthy, and all the other teams in the OFC are ticking the right boxes when it comes to spending money.""We have state of the art facilities, we're entering all the competitions, Tahiti at the Confederations Cup and were at the semi-finals in beach soccer, the Solomons are doing well in Futsal, New Zealand's at the world cup; so for a small federation I thing we're punching above our weight.""","Pacific, Soccer, Solomon Islands, ",2013-10-15T22:44:19+00:00

Under the plan announced by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on Friday, people arriving at Christmas Island will be processed offshore, but there are fears the existing centres on Nauru and PNG will not be big enough.Senator Carr says it is up to Pacific nations to volunteer to help Australia and not for him to ""twist anyone's arms"" to demand they participate.""If, as it develops with Papua New Guinea, it appeals to other nations in the Pacific to talk to us about them participating, then we stand ready to engage with them,"" he said.""I'm not here to make a submission to the prime minister, I'm not here to raise it with him.""But if it comes up because we're talking about regional issues, I'll most certainly explain that Australia is coping with a sharp spike in the number of people brought to our waters by people smugglers, and that this regional resettlement arrangement is a practical and humane solution to that.""He says it is already on the record that Australia wants to talk to other nations in the Pacific about the regional resettlement arrangement.""I'm not here to attempt to twist anyone's arms or to mount a case,"" he said.""If other nations in the Pacific see the value in what we're doing, especially as they participate in conferences and discussions about the impact of human trafficking and people smuggling, then we stand ready to talk to them about it.""[Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo], like other leaders in the Pacific, can observe that our relationship with Papua New Guinea on regional resettlement works to the advantage of both Australia and PNG, and to the advantage of a more regular and human migration program, enabling Australia to do the things we want to do.""That is, end the practice of people smugglers causing these disasters at sea, and enabling us to consider expanding further our humanitarian intake, drawing people from the camps around the world where they want a chance to come to Australia by regular means.""Since Mr Rudd announced his tougher asylum seeker policy last Friday, 207 asylum seekers have arrived in Australia by boat.Opposition Leader Tony Abbott says if Labor is serious about its new regime, those people will be sent to Manus Island immediately. ""Not a single one of them has so far gone to Manus Island, and if Mr Rudd is serious about intimidating the people smugglers and their customers, people have got to be leaving for Manus Island now,"" he said.Mr Abbott says that means within the next 24 to 48 hours.""The test of whether Mr Rudd is fair dinkum is clear: will every single illegal arrival by boat from Friday end up in Manus, and will they be sent now?"" he said.Immigration Minister Tony Burke says it was always made clear that asylum seekers coming here would be subject to rigorous health checks and vaccinations before being sent to Manus.""You cannot do these checks within 24 to 48 hours and Tony Abbott knows that,"" he said.""He's a former health minister. To see a former health minister dare us to not conduct the health checks is about as extraordinary as it gets.""The health checks could take up to two weeks, giving the Government time to relocate the asylum seekers who are already on Manus Island but are not subject to new, stricter rules. The Coalition has indicated it will not abandon the package altogether if it is elected this year, but it is casting doubt over whether it can work and about the legitimacy of deals done with Papua New Guinea.Mr Rudd says Mr Abbott is sending a mixed message to people smugglers around the world.""By sending that mixed message to people smugglers around the world, it seems to me that the result would be to try and muddy the waters,"" he said.""Therefore, maybe it's in his political interests not to see this agreement work.""Meanwhile, Mr Burke will travel to Nauru on Friday, where he will meet officials and inspect the tens of millions of dollars damage Friday's fire and riot caused the island's detention centre.More than 100 asylum seekers have been charged over the incident and Mr Burke says he expects those involved to face the full force of the Nauruan law.""The way the criminal law of Nauru will come down on the people who were involved in the riot will send a message that won't be lost on anyone, anywhere in the detention network,"" he said.""I think if anyone was in any doubt as to whether or not you are somehow insulated from criminal law because you are in detention they will discover the cold, hard truth of the matter.""Immigration and law enforcement insiders have told the ABC it was obvious trouble was brewing at the Nauru detention centre well before the riot.Nauru's government says rebuilding has started at the processing centre, but it could take months to complete. Acting president David Adeang says the government is also reassessing its policy regarding asylum seekers' access to the wider community.He sacked his Australian police commissioner, Richard Britten, during Friday night's riot over disagreements about calling for backup.Mr Adeang says he authorised the deployment of 200 young Nauruan men to support the police and security guards who were trying to control the riots.

He declined to disclose how many animals had been transported.The resort acquired 27 dolphins from the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific between 2008 and 2009. Two of them died and the remaining 25 have since been kept in the Philippines pending their transfer to Singapore.Animal rights activists in the Philippines last month filed a civil suit to stop the animals being transported to Singapore, saying that their capture violated an international treaty on the trade of endangered animals and plants.While a court in the Philippines initially agreed to a temporary ban on exporting the dolphins, another court later overturned it.A Singapore-based animals rights group has also opposed the inclusion of the dolphins in the marine mark, saying catching them from the Solomon Islands is detrimental to the survival of the species there.A picture on the park's blog on Tuesday showed four bottlenose dolphins ""undergoing acclimatisation in their new residence"".When all the dolphins are ready, they will be housed at the park's twin attractions: the S.E.A Aquarium and Adventure Cove Waterpark.The aquarium is touted as the world's largest with 100,000 marine animals spanning over 800 species in 45 million litres (12 million gallons) of water, while the water park features slides and wave pools in addition to marine life.The park is set to open to the public on Thursday but the dolphin attraction will only be ready next year.AFP","Animal Cruelty, Asia, Pacific, Philippines, Singapore, Solomon Islands, ",2012-11-20T15:09:41+00:00

""Kate had already had her whole wardrobe sorted for the trip but Ellena thought why not, if she wears it she wears it,"" she said.""So Ellena was really surprised she had worn it.""In the Solomons, authorities are furious, saying they specifically asked for Prince William's measurements so they could make him a shirt with a map of the Solomon Islands on it.They were told Catherine would wear one of her own dresses.But the honorary US consul left the Cook Islands made shirt and dress in their room as gifts, and the royal couple put them on.An angry statement from the governor-general's office says US representative Kethie Saunders smuggled the Cook Islands clothes into the room in a breach of protocol.

In fact, it was half a colony. When the British were in charge it was called the Gilbert and Ellis Islands. The Gilbertese were Micronesian while the Ellis Islanders were Polynesian and they decided to split on independence in the late 1970s.So the Gilberts became Kiribati and the Ellis Islands, Tuvalu.That connection to Britain is not so marked in Papua New Guinea which although it still has the Queen as head of state was a colony of Australia.When the Solomon Islands Government recently went looking for a new police commissioner it did not turn to Australia. Rather it hired John Lansley, a British cop, once a chief superintendent at Barking and Dagenham, who had served as Assistant Commissioner in the Solomons under another Englishman, William Morrell, from 2003 to 2005.They both left the Solomons when Australia offered to take over supplementing the pay of the Police Commissioner – provided he was an Australian. Shane Castles from the Australian Federal Police got the top job but it was not a happy experience.The government of Manasseh Sogavare declared Castles persona non grata in 2006 and forbade him from returning to the Solomons from leave because he had authorised a raid on the Prime Minister’s office. That was all to do with the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the flight on a PNG Defence Force aircraft of Mr Sogavare’s chosen attorney-general, Julian Moti, who had skipped bail in Port Moresby while facing extradition proceedings over alleged child sex offences in Vanuatu.Complicated? Yeah, that’s Melanesia for you.Complicated? Yeah, that’s Melanesia for you.But there is absolutely no doubt the Solomon Islanders put on a great show for the royal couple. And not only on their arrival.I did see one report from the British press travelling with William and Kate suggest that almost the entire population of the Solomons had turned out to welcome them. Not quite. The Solomons has a population heading towards 600,000 and most of them do not live in Honiara or on Guadalcanal.There are actually about 1,000 islands in the Solomons in nine main island groups.Kate and William will be spending a night on one of those beautiful islands, Tavanipupu, just off Guadalcanal.I can vouch for it being beautiful. We spent a couple of nights there many years ago after the wedding of my great journalistic colleague, Mary-Louise O’Callighan, to Joses Tuhanuku, who once led the trade union movement in the Solomons and is a former opposition leader.The ties to Britain remain remarkably strong. Queen Elizabeth II herself visited the Solomons twice – in 1974 and 1982.Prince William told guests at the meal put on at the Solomon Islands Governor-General’s residence that his grandmother had fond memories of the Solomon Islands.""Our expectations were pretty high after what the Queen had told us,"" the Prince said. ""But nothing had prepared us for the welcome we received.""During that second visit by the Queen in 1982, Prince Phillip had been alarmed at the high birth rate and said so publicly.He was admonished by the then head of family planning in the Solomons who, incidentally, had a very large family.He [Prince Phillip] was admonished by the then head of family planning in the Solomons who, incidentally, had a very large family.According to Television New Zealand locals are hoping the Duke and Duchess leave Tavanipupu with more than just good memories.""If a little surprise should happen in nine months time maybe Tuvanipupu Windsor?""

680,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-05-04/new-document/3992512,"There are fears foreign aid to Australia's South Pacific neighbours could be in for a chop in next week's budget and experts say that would leave the door open to an ever increasing Chinese influence in the region. Australia has committed to a doubling of its aid budget to about $8 billion by 2015, but there is concern that next week's budget could slash that target.Professor Stephen Howes, director of International and Development Economics at ANU, says the Government could even scrap the plan altogether. ""There is also speculation that the Government, if it hits the pause button this year, will push back the 2015 target or that they might abandon it altogether,"" he said.Regional experts fear that could give China's growing influence even more room to move. From the tiniest atolls to the bigger island states of the South Pacific, China is throwing its largesse around.   In East Timor it is a multi-million dollar defence headquarters; in the Cook Islands an impressive sporting complex and in Vanuatu the regional centre of the Melanesian spearhead group, just to name a few. Fergus Hanson, from the Brookings Institute in Washington, has done four reports into China's aid program in the region.""If we take a starting point of about 2005 to the present, China has increased aid from a relatively modest amount - roundabout $30 million a year - up to around a level of around $200 million a year,"" he said. ""It's got quite a large diplomatic presence. There's different reports that say it's got the most number of diplomats on the ground in the countries that it covers.""Professor Richard Herr is the director for the Centre of International and Regional Affairs at the University of Fiji and says China plays by its own rules.""They're not particularly good at working multilaterally and yet in the South Pacific area a lot of our relationships are multilateral,"" he said. ""And it doesn't have an effective aid coordination arrangement so that aid comes out of a number of different baskets in Beijing and so they don't actually have an aid policy that can coordinate effectively with regional or indeed even international efforts.""What also worries regional observers is that much of China's engagement is now delivered in the form of soft loans. Fergus Hanson says this can hamper development rather than promote it.  ""In the case of a country like Tonga, for example, you're talking about 30 per cent of the country's GDP is actually accounted for in soft loans pledged by China,"" he said. ""One consequence could be we're pushed to help these countries get out of their debt situation. So I think that would certainly be something we'd want to avoid; having to help repay Chinese loans.""Professor Howes led the Government-commissioned review into foreign aid last year. He concluded that the South Pacific had the highest strategic value for Australia and recommended significant aid increases.""For PNG and Solomon's we recommended a fairly small increase on the grounds that we weren't confident that we'd get a high value for a major expansion of those aid programs because of the underlying governance problems,"" he said. ""South Pacific microstates we recommended a doubling of aid.""To keep the Pacific in Australia's sphere of influence and aid delivery transparent, Professor Herr says the Federal Government needs to stay on track with its aid commitments.""These are people that need education, health, job opportunities [and they're] all on our doorstep,"" he said. ""These are Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and these are the states that have the most resources and in that sense our aid, and the effectiveness of our aid, will certainly be an issue with these states.""","Australia, Budget, China, Federal Government, Foreign Affairs, International Aid and Trade, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, ",2012-05-04T09:28:47+00:00

She had to be obliterated. It seems the police agreed. No charges were laid.In some parts of the world, not only do fathers, brothers and husbands own a woman's body, they own her virtue. Their identity and manliness is embedded in it.This, of course, is an impossible burden for any woman to carry.Afghan teenager Aishia learned that last year, when she was pinned down as her husband cut off her nose and ears, because she tried to escape his family's abuse. Seventeen-year-old Dua Khalil learned it too, just before she was stoned to death in northern Iraq three years ago, for having a boyfriend. Bangladeshi woman Fozilitun Nessa also learned it, when her face was doused in acid because she refused a marriage proposal.For the hundreds of thousands of women killed, maimed, or savagely beaten for expressing their free will, ""honour"" doesn't come into it. Nor does a fair trial. As Iranian mother Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani knows too well. She's on death row, facing execution by stoning for having sex with a man who wasn't her husband.There is a totalising ideology on the march across the world, and it's anti-women. This is not about religion, piety or virtue. Rather it's about misogyny and a global war against women. It's about the rights and freedoms of women. The ownership and control over women's bodies has become the chief battleground.World events and the rise of neo-fundamentalism in the 80s and 90s, by young men eager to revive and restore old practices, have made feminism more important than ever. And yet feminism has lost its voice.We don't know how to respond to the horrors of infallible patriarchal control. In our failure to act and strenuously resist this global push back against women's liberty and free agency, feminism is at a point of moral crisis.Has feminism failed? Numbers have improved, legal structures and new frameworks have been erected. The scaffolding is there - for some of us. But for a growing number of the world's women, their freedoms are at serious risk. And feminism remains deathly silent.Right now, at a time when we need a massive feminist surge to fight back rising anti-woman sentiment, we're sitting on our hands. Is this not our business too? Why do feminist responsibilities stop at the border?Somali born feminist, Aayan Hirsi Ali, speaks of the West's ""misguided politeness"" in opting to say nothing and do nothing about the abhorrent abuses and treatment of women and girls, that are excused as cultural custom or religious rites.Honour killings, female genital mutilation, acid attacks, forced marriages, and sexual slavery are among the so-called 'cultural' practices she has in mind when Hirsi Ali calls on Western feminists to ""take on the plight of Muslim women and make it their own cause"".However, indignity, debasement and gender apartheid extend beyond fundamentalism. Ignorance is perhaps the greatest tool of control used against women. There are 62 million primary school age girls around the world who don't go to school. Some 520 million women can't read.More than half a million women die each year - around one per minute - from treatable reproductive complications, and a lack of priority.It is inconceivable to me that someone can pick up a newborn baby girl and in disgust throw it into a ""slops pail"", uttering the words ""useless thing"". Chinese writer Xinran Xue described this scene recently when writing about ""Gendercide"" and the world's missing 100 million baby girls. At least being chucked in the bin is a quick death. Other baby girls are slowly starved, or simply abandoned, for one single reason - they are female.What is it about girls and women that make them so utterly dispensable?In our own backyard, the Pacific region, some of the rates of maternal death are among the worst in the world. Papua New Guinea is only surpassed by Afghanistan and yet this scandal of female neglect rates no mention here. Picture Fiji, Vanuatu, or the Solomn Islands, and we think of holidays. What we choose not to see are skyrocketing teenage pregnancies and extremely high rates of violence against women. Sixty per cent of Pacific nations have no laws against domestic violence. Which is perhaps why 73 per cent of women in the Solomons think it's OK for a husband to beat his wife. Last year Vanuatu's traditional chiefs challenged a 2008 law passed to protect women form domestic violence, saying it ""contradicted Vanuatu's custom"".Traditional, cultural practices that assert male authority will always disadvantage women. So why do we kow-tow to them? Why are we so ready to adopt a lazy, cultural-relativist position?Has feminism failed? Perhaps not for you and I. But you know what?It's not just about us.This is an edited version of a speech delivered by journalist and social commentator Virginia Haussegger last Wednesday in the IQ2 Debate ""Feminism has failed"", at the Melbourne Town Hall.","Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, China, Community and Society, Crime, Domestic Violence, Feminism, Fiji, Iran, Islamic Republic Of, Iraq, Law, Crime and Justice, Pacific, Palestinian Territories, Poverty, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Vanuatu, Women, ",2010-09-28T05:21:00+00:00

We see mangrove systems that support fisheries gone and what we see is food security plummet.""It is the loss of food stocks that has scientists like Professor Hoegh-Guldberg most concerned.More than 150 million people, many already poor, live on the shores of the coral triangle, relying on its bounty for food.""By the end of the century under the worst case scenario we could see as much as 90 per cent of those food resources having eroded,"" he said.""You start to see that you are now destabilising human communities through the fact that there is just not enough food. So where do they go? We'll almost invariably see an increased level of pressure on Australia and New Zealand to provide the sort of intake that needs to alleviate these problems.""The authors of the Climate Change and Coral Triangle report say there needs to be an 80 per cent cut in global carbon emissions by 2050 to save the marine ecosystem.But even that will not prevent some of the worst effects already being wrought in the coral triangle by climate change.With that in mind leaders from 70 countries, including Australia, are meeting in Indonesia this week for the World Ocean Conference.They will be looking to find ways to better protect the world's oceans in the post-Kyoto, climate change agreement that will take effect after 2012.That will be negotiated in Denmark in December.A 25 per cent cut in global emissions by 2020 is the target many countries, including Australia, have now indicated they might sign up to.But Professor Hoegh-Guldberg remains unconvinced.""There is no doubt that cutting Australia's emissions by 25 per cent is going to be a challenging task but it's only going to be worth it if we get down to 20 per cent of emissions by 2050,"" he said.""And that's I think where we've got to go. We've got to show real action that shows we are progressing to decarbonise our economy as quickly as possible.""I think we've got to take this issue as a global emergency and we are not doing that.""","Academic Research, Australia, Climate Change, Environment, Indonesia, Oceans and Reefs, Philippines, QLD, Science and Technology, Solomon Islands, ",2009-05-12T22:00:00+00:00

New Zealand had been bracing for the tsunami to hit its east coast but there have been no reports of damage from the impact so far.The tsunami was generated by a magnitude-8.3 earthquake which struck 190 kilometres southwest of American Samoa.At least 14 people have been reported dead in American Samoa and at least five in Samoa. There were reports that three children died in Samoa as the tsunami flattened houses and swept away cars.There are also fears for the fate of the island communities between Samoa and New Zealand, with three-metre waves reported from the area.A reporter for Radio Polynesia told Radio New Zealand that villages were ""wiped out"" by the tsunami and people had been reported missing.The Samoan capital Apia has been evacuated and thousands of people have been moved to higher ground.

I'm assuming if dad's injured and there are people missing it was pretty quick,"" he said.The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said waves 1.57 metres tall hit American Samoa, while 0.7 metre waves were recorded in Samoa.New Zealanders have been told to expect waves making first landfall on the country's east coast, including East Cape and the city of Gisborne, soon. NZ's minister of civil defence has warned people to get off the country's beaches.A brief statement issued by the Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre, operated by the Bureau of Meteorology and Geoscience Australia, said no Australian territory would be hit by the tsunami.But senior meteorologist Tony Leggett says the New South Wales and Southern Queensland coastline could experience some unusual currents later this morning.DFAT says Australians who are concerned about friends or relatives in the region can call a special hotline on 1300 555 135.Russell Hunter, a journalist with the Samoa Observer, says the quake lasted a minute-and-a-half.""There doesn't seem to be any damage around the capital.

That was quite scary.""The USA's Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre had earlier issued a tsunami warning for a large swathe of the South Pacific including Fiji, New Zealand and Tonga after the US Geological Survey (USGS) reported a 7.9 magnitude quake.The centre later said an 8.3 magnitude quake had been recorded at a depth of 33 kilometres. It was not immediately clear if this was the same quake and the USGS's website did not provide exact details of its location.In its preliminary earthquake report, the US Geological Survey put the epicentre 204 kilometres south-south-west of Samoa's capital Apia and at a depth of 85 kilometres.The USGS said the region was struck by a 5.6 magnitude quake about 20 minutes after the first.","American Samoa, Disasters and Accidents, Earthquakes, Hawaii, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Pitcairn, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, ",2009-09-29T19:00:00+00:00

Doctors and nurses of course, but midwives; people who are just local in the community with some training to assist women when they get into difficulty with birth,"" he added.Poor progress towards the much vaunted millennium development goals was also the theme of a separate UN report from UNICEF, which warned that not one Pacific Island country was cutting its child mortality rate fast enough to meet goal number four to cut the death rate of under fives by two thirds by 2015.That report also pointed to low health spending and poor control by central governments over implementation.It pointedly cites a lack of political will in the region. Outward migration of skilled medical workers is another problem.The UNFPA report this year focussed on the need for culturally sensitive delivery of development aid. It is hardly a new catchcry.But the UNFPA's Vietnam representative Ian Howie used a stark example from that country of where training local staff could prevent disasters for women giving birth.""In the H'mong ethnic areas of Vietnam, for example, women often choose a traditional birth at home, or literally walk alone into the forest to give birth rather than go to a health clinic,"" he said.""Why do they do this? Because they do not want to show their bodies to people who are not of their own ethnicity and who do not understand their culture.""The UNFPA warned though that cultural sensitivity should not outrank agreed international human rights standards. As Mr McMullan put it, ""it shouldn't mean defending the undependable.""Based on a report by Linda Mottram for Radio Australia.","Health, Papua New Guinea, Pregnancy and Childbirth, Reproduction and Contraception, Solomon Islands, Vietnam, ",2008-11-15T01:21:00+00:00

768,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-07-24/happy-anniversary-ramsi/450564,"Five years ago today, Australia embarked on one of its most ambitious foreign policy exercises in recent years when it led the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands.RAMSI, comprising of 15 countries from the region, was conceived as a new model for foreign intervention. The aims of the mission were not only to take back control of a country rapidly descending into civil war, but also to remain in a 'nation building' role to rebuild government and the economy.This was ambitious new territory for Australia and a new model for foreign interventions worldwide. But how successful has RAMSI been in meeting its military and civil objectives?From a military point of view, RAMSI has been an unqualified success. In 2003 when the first troops were deployed, the Solomon Islands was on the brink of becoming the region's first failed state. The population of the capital halved in a matter of months as people fled the arbitrary violence of roaming militiamen.The economic collapse was no less dramatic. It is estimated that exports more than halved from their pre-conflict levels and business all over Honiara shut virtually over night. The Gold Ridge gold mine was closed and ransacked, the main palm oil plantation uprooted and the tuna cannery was shut down. Logging was severely affected. The Reserve Bank of the Solomon Islands ran out of money at the height of the conflict and the electricity generator could not operate for a lack of funds. Dark times indeed.Within weeks of being deployed, RAMSI was able to restore civil stability to the Solomon Islands. More than 6,000 militiamen have been arrested, over 9,000 charges have been laid and over 3,000 firearms have been confiscated. The Solomon Islands police force has been purged of 160 rogue officers. Peace has returned to the Solomon Islands.The economy has also recovered, albeit from a low base. But at current growth rates, it will still take the Solomon Islands more than a decade to return to pre conflict levels.RAMSI has managed a return to macroeconomic stability, an essential base for future growth. The tax system has improved with government revenues increasing. Other efforts have focused on reducing regulatory hurdles to beginning formal businesses and easing restrictions on hiring and firing. Government slush funds are less common now that audits are regularly conducted and accounting systems in place.But these changes do nothing to address the constraints on development in the Solomon Islands. Over 85 per cent of the population is dependent on subsistence agriculture while the formal economy is composed mostly of the public service. Industrial production is dominated by one large palm oil plantation and a goldmine no longer producing gold. Logs dominate exports while production of non-timber agriculture is negligible.Living standards in the Solomon Islands haven't improved much since independence. Hundreds of reports by dozens of organisations have already documented that the key constraints to development are land tenure and a lack of infrastructure, including education. But little progress has been made in easing these constraints.Traditional land ownership was appropriate to subsistence farming, with the areas of land being worked changing with family needs, but a move to cash production entails property rights in land. Property rights are also essential to the commercial development of manufacturing, tourism and other service industries. All these potential employment generating industries are constrained because there is no system of allocating available land. A necessary first step is to complete a land survey. As a large, technical and expensive job, it is ideal for RAMSI to tackle.Infrastructure, particularly roads and schools are also needed. Some of the roads damaged in the civil conflict have been restored, but much more investment is needed to link producers and consumers. The education system has seen little improvement in 30 years.RAMSI's leadership claims it has no mandate to execute important reform programs that would ease these key constraints. Yet the mission's security and nation building objectives are both intimately tied to economic success, and the government in Honiara has been calling for more involvement by RAMSI in economic development.It is time for RAMSI to stop buck-passing and take greater responsibility for economic development.Five years after landing in Honiara, the city is still filled with idle young men with no jobs and nothing to do but watch busy expatriates hurry about their city. These young men are harbingers of future instability. Without more involvement in reforms that will promote economic development, RAMSI risks becoming little more than one of the countless organisations that in the past has promised the Solomon Islands so much but delivered little.Gaurav Sodhi is an economist at the Centre for Independent Studies.","Australia, Defence Forces, Defence and National Security, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Solomon Islands, World Politics, ",2008-07-23T22:50:00+00:00

781,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-04-30/ramsis-job-only-half-complete/2420836,"Now into its fifth year and with no exit strategy in sight, questions are beginning to be asked about the future of the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI). Should it stay or should it go?In a new Aid/Watch report, Tim Anderson argues that since RAMSI has successfully restored law and order, it should be gradually wound down to make a graceful exit. Dr Anderson correctly points out that large aid-dominated nation building efforts do not have a good track record and come with high costs. The currency swells and some sectors of the economy get crowded out while an elite of highly paid expatriates and locals participates in a foreign funded government bubble.This does not mean that RAMSI should go. It does mean, however, that RAMSI should adjust its policies to focus on promoting economic growth rather maintaining the status quo.As far as foreign interventions go, RAMSI is unique. Conceived from its inception as having both a military and a civil component, the aims of the mission were not only to restore law and order to the increasingly violent and unruly Solomon Islands, but also to stick around in the aftermath to oversee reconstruction. Exiting now would leave the mission only half complete. There is little doubt that RAMSI has been successful on the military front, but its contribution to economic development has been mixed.Aid/Watch bemoans that there is little relationship between GDP and citizen welfare. Although the distribution of wealth matters, economic development means more than just higher GDP figures. It means that people have jobs, access to healthcare and education for their children and are optimistic about the future.The Solomon Islands has one of the highest population growth rates in the world. Every year some 16,000 young people enter the workforce. Without a growing economy to absorb this swelling pool of unemployed and underemployed youth and put them into jobs, they will continue to gather on the streets of Honiara with nothing to do but sit in the shade and chew betel nut. They are a harbinger of future instability. To maintain the civil stability that has been won, economic growth is a crucial objective, one that RAMSI is justified in pursuing.But RAMSI has to get it right. There has been little economic growth in the Solomon Islands since independence. Why are health and education outcomes no better than 30 years ago when other countries in the Asian region have transformed their standards of living within a generation?The underdevelopment of the Solomon Islands suggests it has had some pretty lousy governments since independence. It is also damning of the many aid organisations who can show little improvement for their hundreds of millions of dollars of largesse.The Solomon Islands does not remain poor for a lack of attention. Hundreds of reports have been written and submitted by countless multilateral bodies and NGOs over decades. The same recommendations and the same promises have been made, yet the reforms that are essential to remove constraints in agricultural and private sector development have been ignored.RAMSI has done better than its predecessors and built a base for future growth by overseeing the restoration of macroeconomic stability in the Solomon Islands. But efforts to increase economic production have focused on reducing regulatory barriers to business in Honiara and encouraging foreign investment. The Solomon Islands, where most people do not even participate in the cash economy, now has world-class banking regulations.The majority of Solomon Islanders have not benefited from these measures because this is not where the bottlenecks to economic growth are. RAMSI is right to be pursuing reform, but it has been persistently aiming at the wrong targets.Agriculture is the key to raising rural living standards and existing land tenure is the key impediment to raising agricultural output and incomes. Traditional land ownership was appropriate to subsistence farming, where the areas of land being worked changed according to family needs, but a move to cash production needs property rights in land. Separating use rights from ownership rights using long-term leases can unlock productivity gains without destroying traditional ownership. Land surveys and land registration are necessary first steps.Infrastructure is another key constraint. Agriculture and small off-farm business cannot develop without inter island transport, mobile phones and roads to link producers and consumers.RAMSI has played a crucial role in restoring peace to the Solomon Islands and can play an equally crucial role to its future development and stability - but only if it targets the constraints that have locked the population into poverty since independence. Unless it is involved in raising agricultural productivity and increasing the provision of infrastructure including education, RAMSI risks becoming another in a long line of agencies that have promised much but delivered little.Gaurav Sodhi is a researcher at The Centre for Independent Studies.","Defence and National Security, Disaster Relief, Foreign Affairs, Solomon Islands, ",2008-04-29T22:04:00+00:00

The milk and the ""meat"" are also highly nutritious, and studies have shown the oil has anti bacterial and anti viral properties.But Dr Dan Etherington says multinational business who have a vested interest in promoting other, hydrogenated vegetable oils, like margarines, have convinced western medicine that coconut oil is bad for you, because it's a saturated fat.Dr Etherington says in fact there is considerable evidence to show diets rich in coconuts are healthy, and it's only once people adopt a western diet full of lard and dairy food, that they become obese.For 25 years Dr Dan Etherington was an agricultural economist in the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies at the Australian National University, an overseas aid advocate and for the last 16 years he's developed and manufactured a coconut press with his company Kokonut Pacific, so villagers on South Pacific Islands can make their own oil.He's been recognised for that work with a Member of the Order of Australia this year.Dr Etherington says coconut oil is used for the fat in milk for premature babies, because it is rapidly metabolised and elite athletes use it for quickly recovering energy.""But for some reason, the Heart Foundation continues to say that for normal people it's terrible and it'll do great damage.""He suggests that coconut oil is bad for Australian farmers who are producing other oils in competition.""In order to make soybean oil or canola competitive with the hard oil of coconut the saturated oil, they have to hydrogenate the oil and that's what we get in most of our margarine. The anger against coconut oil is driven by the vested interest of the multinationals in other aspects of the global vegetable oil industry,"" he says.Getting startedBorn and raised on a successful farm in Kenya, Dan Etherington always wanted to help poorer farmers get ahead.He's been teaching courses in sustainable agriculture at the Australian National University. He first conceived of the coconut press in 1992 and by 2005, 10,000 people were benefiting from it in the South Pacific.The idea came to him when he was working in Mozambique. He was doing a review of the coconut industry, when he met a team of village soap makers who had run out of copra, because the local mill was closed for rehabilitation. He began thinking there was enormous range of things that could be done at the village level.A friend Bruce Bowman takes up the story of how Dan Etherington invented the coconut oil press.""Going back 20 years give or take a few, Dan was on the roof of their old caravan with a caulking gun. You know, the sort with a cartridge inside. Then came the 'Eureka Moment' and Dan jumped down, stripping the silastic out of the cartridge, and calling to (his wife) Maureen, asking if she had any desiccated coconut. Filling the cartridge with the coconut and adding a little water, Dan reassembled the gun and began squeezing the trigger. Out came pure coconut oil!"" writes Bruce Bowman.""From there it was a small mental step to the press idea. There were and still are many big steps to take. But the practicality of oil extraction at ambient temperature in a village economy had been established,"" says Mr Bowman.Now in the Solomon Islands there are women in the villages making their own soap using this coconut oil press.As well, they're using a blend their home made Coconut oil with diesel in tractors, cars and generators.Dan Etherington is busy collecting small jars to send to the Solomon Islands, so oil can be pressed and stored for use in oil lamps.In another recent success story, Samoan women have secured a major contract with the cosmetic giant the Body Shop, to produce virgin coconut oil that they've extracted using this press.How the press worksThe coconut is dried using the burning husks to heat them for half an hour. Then it's broken up and put into a metre length cylinder with small slits all up the side.With a ratchet action, the piston of the press squeezes out the coconut oil. Dried coconut contains 66 per cent oil, and two kilograms of dried coconut will give you one litre of oil.""It takes a team of four to six to work the system. They can produce up to 50 litres of oil a day,"" says Dr Etherington.Parts of the equipment are manufactured in Queanbeyan, but the rest is manufactured to his specifications locally on the islands. It's not cheap, he says. It costs about $10,000 for each press and additional equipment, but the rewards are there.""Each palm produces a new bunch of coconuts approximately every month of every year. So if someone has five acres of coconuts, he has more or less a continuous supply,"" he says.","Agricultural Machinery, Alternative Energy, Canberra, Climate Change, Community Development, Conservation, Disaster Relief, Engineering, Health, International Aid and Trade, Land Clearing, Papua New Guinea, Queanbeyan, Queanbeyan East, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Sustainable and Alternative Farming, ",2008-01-28T21:38:00+00:00
