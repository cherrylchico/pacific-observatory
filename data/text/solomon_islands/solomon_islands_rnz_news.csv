Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has taken aim at the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) report on the Fukushima discharge.The IAEA reviewed Japan's plan to release the treated nuclear wastewater into the ocean and found the plan, which is underway, met international safety standards.Japan maintains it is safe and said it would not allow the discharge of water into the ocean which would endanger human health and the environment.But at the UN General Assembly in New York, Sogavare said his country stands with like-minded Pacific Islanders and it is appalled at Japan's decision to go ahead with the release.""The effect of this act is transboundary and intergenerational and is an attack on global trust and solidarity,"" he said.He said the increased warming and acidification of the ocean over 30-years-plus poses worrying risk for his people's wellbeing and future.""The message is clear: our lives, our people, do not matter.""Sogavare attacked the IAEA report, saying it was ""inconclusive"", and ""the scientific data shared remains inadequate, incomplete and biased"".""These concerns were ignored. If this nuclear waste is safe, it should be stored in Japan.""The fact that it is dumped into the sea shows that it is not safe.""Japan's state broadcaster reported earlier that day, IAEA's director-general Rafael Grossi expressed his agency's commitment to ensuring the safe release of treated and diluted water from the Fukushima plant.Japan was given a right of reply in the UN chamber, and a representative of Japan - who was not named - said some of Sogavare's statement was not factually correct.""The government of Japan has never allowed and will never allow the discharge of the water into the ocean which would endanger human health and the environment,"" the representative said.She said the Pacific Islands Forum Foreign ministers' statement this month recognised the IAEA as the authority on nuclear safety.She said it has been taking measures strictly abiding by relevant international law and being transparent.""The government of Japan has always provided detailed explanation on this matter to the international community, including PIF members, based on scientific evidence in a transparent manner.""",26 Sep 2023

By Nick Sas and Chrisnrita Aumanu-Leong, ABC PacificSolomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has declined a White House invitation to meet with US President Joe Biden at the Pacific leaders' summit this week.In a move that will further stoke Australian and US concerns over Mr Sogavare's perceived lean towards China, Sogavare will return to Solomon Islands capital Honiara this week after delivering his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last Friday.United States authorities are reportedly disappointed by Sogavare's decision to decline the invitation.He is the only Pacific leader to decline, apart from Vanuatu's new Prime Minster Sato Kilman, who has remained in Port Vila to navigate a brewing political crisis after taking power two weeks ago.A Solomon Islands government official told the ABC Sogavare would not attend because of ""domestic issues"", saying Sogavare needed to be back in the Honiara parliament for a raft of bills, and the invitation from the White House came after parliament business had been set.Solomon Islands Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele will attend in Sogavare's place.The White House summit, in its second year, was initiated by the Biden administration to reboot relations in the Pacific region as China continues its own aggressive push.Pacific leaders will meet with Biden and attend a range of events across a three-day period in Washington starting on Monday.The White House said the summit was designed to ""reaffirm the US commitment to our shared regional priorities and deepening our cooperation around them"".The US - by its own admission - has been largely absent in the Pacific region over the past three decades, but has been loudly proclaiming it is ""back"" to help with development issues and the lingering threat of climate change.It reopened its embassy in Solomon Islands last year, and US ambassador to Australia Caroline Kennedy told the ABC that Washington had ""hundreds of millions"" ready to spend in the country but was ""waiting for permission"" from the Solomon Islands government.Western powers have been increasingly concerned over Solomon Islands' moves towards China since it signed a secretive security pact last year.China has been pouring money into the country and has funded a new national stadium and infrastructure developments for the upcoming Pacific Games, which will be held in November.Sogavare has defended his country's position, saying it is ""friends to all, enemies to none"", and has rejected claims the security pact will lead to China building a military base in the country.In his speech at the United Nations on Friday, Sogavare called for global peace and spoke about the ""toxic mix of geopolitical power posturing"" in the region.The speech called for greater action on climate change, but it focused on more equity in trade and fairer partnerships for developing nations.And in comments that will no doubt raise anxieties in Canberra, Sogavare singled out China in his speech, praising the country for its work as a development partner and highlighting the ""comprehensive strategic framework"" he developed with China's President Xi Jinping during his visit in July.

""We applaud the People's Republic of China for the initiative in accelerating the implementation of the 2030 agenda through their Belt and Road initiative, global development initiative [sic], global security initiative and global civilisation initiative,"" he said.Australia is by far Solomon Islands' biggest aid donor and has been leading development projects in the country for decades, but China is the country's largest trade partner.In his strongest condemnation yet, Mr Sogavare also denounced Japan's release of wastewater from Fukushima's crippled nuclear plant.In comments echoing China's concerns - and going against the views of leaders from Fiji and Papua New Guinea - he said he was ""appalled"" by the move and warned of effects on the South Pacific's waters.- This story was originally published by ABC Pacific.",25 Sep 2023

Our national interest is development,"" he said.

The prime minister said the need for infrastructure on islands outside the capital, Honiara, is urgent.Already, Chinese telecoms giant Huawei is building a cellular network financed by a $US66 million Export-Import Bank of China loan, prompting concern by a parliamentary committee about the debt burden, while a Chinese state company is to redevelop Honiara's port.The Taipei Times reported that during the week-long trip funded by Beijing, Sogavare is to open the nation's embassy, meet Chinese companies, and visit Jiangsu and Guangdong provinces.",10 Jul 2023

Solomon Islands Ministry of Health & Medical Services has acknowledged concerns raised by the opposition about the shortage of medicines and other health supplies in the country.The issue of access and supply of essential medicines has been an ongoing one in the Solomon Islands.The opposition leader, Matthew Wale, called the drug shortage life-threatening earlier this week.""My office has been reliably informed that there is a serious drug shortage situation around all hospitals and clinics around the country. We have been informed of the same situation in Honiara, Gizo, Auki and Buala,"" Wale said.""It is anybody's guess what the situation is like for the health centres in the other provinces. It is truly disturbing.""Essential drugs such as are Panadol, antibiotics, anti-fugal, anti- inflammatory, ibuprofen, ampicillin, diclofenac, including IV antibiotics and dressings are out of stock, according to Wale.In March, Wale had slammed the government for allowing the problem to persist and called on Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare to address the situation.

However, the health ministry said it was close to resolving the matter.In a statement, it said it has been working closely with the Minister of Finance and Treasury and this has allowed medical supply containers to be cleared from the wharf in Honiara.""The Ministry acknowledges the concerns raised and understands the public outcry. However, the ministry also continues to do its best through providing the necessary health care and services to the general population while at the same time managing the processes required to maintain our stockpile of medicines and consumables,"" it said.The health officials say the medical stocks at the National Medical Store are now at 79 percent of optimum while consumables are at 95 percent.But they point out that getting the material to the provincial medical clinics is dependent on available shipping because of the high cost of air freight.The ministry is now urging shipping owners to be flexible and to prioritise the delivery of the medical cargo to the provinces.The ministry has also stressed that the daily deaths being recorded at the National Referral Hospital in Honiara are not due to the drug shortages but more from the progression of patients' illnesses.It also said it is aware of drugs disappearing along the supply chain and says this is serious matter.The ministry has urged people who may be aware of what is going on to report this information to the relevant authorities.",18 Aug 2023

Solomon Islands opposition has called for an independent investigation into a contentious shipment of 'replica weapons' brought into the country by China after publicly released US diplomatic cables claimed the guns were likely real.A controversy erupted in Solomon Islands in March last year after local media reported that firearms had been smuggled into the capital Honiara.The Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) said at the time the weapons were ""not capable of firing any live munitions"" and that the Chinese embassy had shipped them into the country to help train local officers.But the Solomon Islands opposition and some civil society activists were deeply sceptical of that claim, and rumours around the shipment have continued to swirl over the last 18 months.On Friday last week Al Jazeera reported that US diplomats in Port Moresby cabled back to Washington at the time saying the weapons seemed to be genuine, citing a source who said the ""weapons appeared real in every way, including in weight and mechanics"".The RSIPF held a demonstration showing off the ""replica"" weapons more than a week after the story first broke, but the US diplomatic cable said the guns in the crate were ""not the same"" as the ones publicly displayed.The RSIPF has not yet responded to the claims in the diplomatic missive, but the head of the Solomon Islands Foreign Ministry, Collin Beck, took to social media over the weekend to call the story false.""Sad to see divisive geopolitical narrative to tarnish (Solomon Islands') image with article that holds no truth,"" he said on the website X, formerly Twitter.""Allegation of (Solomon Islands) receiving arms from China is not true and not helpful against today's fast-changing international system.""

But the opposition leader in Solomon Islands, Matthew Wale, has lashed the RSIPF and the government, accusing them of ""deception at the very high level"".""When the very institutions entrusted to protect us are implicated in such deceptive acts, it becomes clear that this government cannot be trusted, especially on matters as critical as national security,"" Wale said in a statement.Prominent opposition MP Peter Kenilorea Jr told the ABC the RSIPF needed to publicly respond to the allegation, and that the government should follow that up by establishing a commission of inquiry into the shipment.""To have this assessment made by a prominent development partner just begs that question again: Were we told the truth? And in the end the truth is what we want to know,"" he said.""There needs to be a broader inquiry into this rather than just the word of the Police Commissioner … to come up independently and verify for us whether yes or no.""Kenilorea Jr said the allegation of weapons smuggling brought back memories of the violence and upheaval which bedevilled Solomon Islands in the lead-up to the RAMSI intervention in 2003, when militants took control of police armouries and seized semi-automatic weapons.""For us, allegations of real weapons coming in, these are issues which touch the heart of the security of our nation,"" he said.

The New Zealand government has rejected claims by Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare that it has withheld financial support promised to the country.On Monday, soon after landing back in Honiara from his official visit to Beijing, Sogavare told local media the Australian and New Zealand governments had promised budget support but ""changed their position and delayed their assistance"".Sogavare, as first reported by ABC, said the decision of its ""traditional donors"" to pull funding support had pushed Solomon Islands to lean on China, who agreed to ""fill the gap"".""Some of our donor partners who have committed to providing budget support to us this year have since changed their position and delayed their assistance for us and we are struggling to finance the 2023 budget,"" he said.""This has left this country and people in a predicament. But I am delighted to announce, the People's Republic of China has really stepped up to provide this budget support needed for 2023.""Australia had promised $12 million while and New Zealand promised $15m in budget support, according to Sogavare.When asked later in the media conference to expand on this statement, he responded in Solomon Islands Pidgin saying that prior to his departure to Beijing cabinet had heard that budgetary funding expected this year from several donor partners including New Zealand, Australia, Japan and the World Bank had been delayed for various reasons.""So, we have analysed that in different ways. But that is how it is,"" he said.""It is their money; we respect them and their taxpayers if they want to help us or not help us that is how it is. But because of that it has put a little bit of pressure on the budget especially our priority to fund the Pacific Games.""The prime minister eventually conceded that some of this funding was expected to arrive in government coffers this month.But he insisted his country would need all the help it could get to deliver on its main priority for this year which is to deliver the Pacific Games in Honiara in November.""We need to have enough resources there in terms of our revenue. I am sure it will pick up already,"" he said.""Maybe the money that our friends have mentioned probably it has already come because they said it would be by mid-July or towards the end of July it should come. Once it comes that is great. We really need to have some resources there to successfully host the Pacific Games.""However, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) spokesperson told RNZ Pacific: ""We have not withheld or delayed any budget support to Solomon Islands.""""Aotearoa New Zealand remains committed to our development partnership, and over the past year has provided around $NZ10.1 million budget support to Solomon Islands including for education, economic reform and Pacific Games support,"" the spokesperson said.""Our development partnership with Solomon Islands is one of our most significant by breadth, depth and value - now at approximately $NZ150m for 2021-2024. This includes budget support as well as funding for specific activities.""The New Zealand High Commissioner in Honiara has been tasked to set the record straight with the Solomon Islands government, confirming New Zealand has honoured its budget support commitments.""

A Solomon Islands MP from Malaita, Claudius Tei'ifi, says successive governments are yet to address the root causes of the ethnic tensions of 20 years ago.Speaking during the Truth and Reconciliation debate in parliament, the West Kwaio MP said the issue of the migration of people to Guadalcanal, especially from Malaita, must be addressed.Tei'ifi said there has never been any tangible plan or development for the people of Malaita to remain in their villages and earn money, and development remains centralised in the capital Honiara.""Squats occupied by Malaitans around Honiara, into Guadalcanal Province have increased tremendously than ever before the tension. New settlements by Malaitans .... have increased,"" he said.He said the ""pull and push"" factors that encourage people to migrate are still to be addressed.Tei'ifi pointed out the uneven distribution of development by the government was one of the main causes of what was known as the ethnic crisis.The Opposition MP said 20 years after the tension there has still not been any major development in Malaita for the Malaita people.He said road infrastructure in Malaita is still in ruins, with broken wooden bridges, and some major ports still without proper wharves.""I believe if successive governments were serious, Malaita Province having one of largest road network in the country should have its main roads north to south, and central to east fully tar sealed, bridges and wharves constructed by now,"" he said.Domestic issues and disagreement over a 2019 switch of diplomatic ties to China from Taiwan have fuelled a dispute between the national government and Malaita.More than 200 people lost their lives during the conflict in Solomon Islands, most of them civilians.This period from 1998 to 2003 is locally referred to as the Ethnic Tensions or simply The Tensions.The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) led by Australia and New Zealand, spent 14 years until 2017 helping to restore law and order and build up government institutions.

The head of the Solomon Islands Submarine Cable Company (SISCC) says repair work on the country's domestic cable should be completed next week.SISCC chief executive Keir Preedy said the cable was damaged on May 10 by a Taiwanese purse seine fishing boat which had dropped anchor in a clearly designated no-anchoring zone near the cable landing site close to the Port of Honiara.""She pulled up the cable and damaged it sufficiently that the domestic (fibre-optic internet) connection stopped working,"" Preedy said.""It was very close to the international cable. The two cables are only 50 metres apart under the water at that distance, which is why we protect them with a no-anchoring zone. And from what we can see there was no service interruption to the international cable.""Domestic internet services weren't so lucky however, and residents of Malaita, Western and Choiseul provinces experienced major internet outages.Keir Preedy said since the incident in May, service providers have had to find work arounds for their customers.""Auki [the capital of Malaita Province] is close enough that there is microwave backup...all of the players out West have had to go and get extra satellite bandwidth from their other providers,"" he said.Preedy said a cable repair ship arrived in the country on Wednesday and is assessing the damage before it starts the repair work.He said they are proceeding with caution because the proximity of the domestic cable to the international cable means there is a risk of damaging one cable while trying to repair the other.""We have an estimate that the repair should take around about five or six days from the boat arriving. So we expect to have it done by the 25th or 26th of July,"" he said.The Taiwanese purse seiner Fukon 808 has been impounded by Solomon Islands maritime authorities since May.Preedy said the cost of damages and loss of business will run into tens of millions of US dollars but he said he could not go into more detail as the discussions about compensation with the owners of the vessel are still ongoing.""So, we don't have a definite time but we could get an early (court) hearing if we needed to,"" Preedy said.""We keep up a degree of dialogue with the vessel owners as well through their lawyers and potentially, providing we get the right amount of recompense, we don't mind whether it's an out-of-court settlement or if we have to use a court to do it.""",21 Jul 2023

By Bernadette Carreon and Aubrey Belford (OCCRP)A major newspaper in Solomon Islands received nearly US$140,000 in funding from the Chinese government in return for pledges to ""promote the truth about China's generosity and its true intentions to help develop"" the Pacific Islands country, according to a leaked document and interviews.The revelation comes amid Western alarm over growing Chinese influence over the strategically located country, which switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 2019 and then signed a surprise security agreement with Beijing last year.Solomon Islands journalists have complained of a worsening media environment, as well as what is perceived to be a growing pro-China slant from local outlets that have accepted funding from the People's Republic.A document obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) shows how one of these outlets, the Solomon Star newspaper, received Chinese assistance after providing repeated and explicit assurances that it would push messages favourable to Beijing.Reporters obtained a July 2022 draft funding proposal from the Solomon Star to China's embassy in Honiara in which the paper requested $SBD1,150,000 (about $US137,000) for equipment including a replacement for its aging newspaper printer and a broadcast tower for its radio station, PAOA FM.The Solomon Star said in the proposal that decrepit equipment was causing editions to come out late and ""curtailing news flow about China's generous and lightning economic and infrastructure development in Solomon Islands"". The document shows the Chinese embassy had initially offered $SBD350,000 in 2021, but revised this number upward in recognition of the newspaper's needs.In total, the proposal contains roughly a dozen separate pledges to use the Chinese-funded equipment to promote China's ""goodwill"" and role as ""the most generous and trusted development partner"" in Solomon Islands.In interviews with OCCRP, both the Solomon Star's then-publisher, Catherine Lamani, and its chief of staff, Alfred Sasako, confirmed the paper had made the proposal, but declined to speak in detail about it.Sasako said the newspaper maintained its independence. He said any suggestion it had a pro-Beijing bias was ""a figment of the imagination of anyone who is trying to demonise China"".Sasako said the paper has tried unsuccessfully for more than a decade to get assistance from Australia's embassy in the country. Other Western countries, such as the United States, had neglected Solomon Islands for decades and were only now showing interest because of anxiety over Chinese influence, he added.""My summary on the whole thing is China is a doer, others are talkers. They spend too much time talking, nothing gets done,"" he said.OCCRP was able to confirm that the printing equipment the Solomon Star had requested was indeed purchased and delivered earlier this year.""I can confirm what was quoted was delivered in February and the payments came from the Solomon Star,"" said Terry Mays, the business development manager of G2 Systems Print Supply Division, the Brisbane-based supplier named in the proposal.The Solomon Star funding is just one part of a regional push to get China's message out in the Pacific Islands, as well as build relationships with the region's elites, reporters have found.Last month, OCCRP reported on an aborted deal in Palau involving the publisher of the country's oldest newspaper and a Chinese business group with links to national security institutions.The Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project is funded worldwide by a variety of government and non-government donors. OCCRP's work in the Pacific Islands is currently funded by a US-government grant that gives the donor zero say in editorial decisions.

Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has leaped to the defence of China saying its strategic interests are misunderstood.Sogavare has been visiting China this week and signed a number of agreements - including a police cooperation deal which has triggered concern - as well as opening the Solomon Islands embassy in Beijing.Voice of America reported in response to the signing of the agreements, the US and Australia have urged Beijing and Honiara to release details of the policing deal.The agreements he mentioned at the opening include a bilateral framework of cooperation, formalising a non-reciprocal trade arrangement, taking part in the first high-level forum on shared action for global development; and signing a biosecurity arrangement including aviation arrangements to facilitate movement of people and goods and services.The prime minister told Chinese media the partnership with ""your great country China"" is the way to go forward.""It is really unfortunate... all the nonsense we are hearing is basically that, a misunderstanding of what China is doing,"" he said.""China has no other strategic interests other than Taiwan and, of course, the South China Sea.""Any country in the world will not be comfortable if you start to intrude into areas which are seen as existential threats by any country. And China is no different.""China and the US have been in a geopolitical power struggle for influence in the Pacific for some time.But Sogavare also reiterated the Pacific is not owned by anyone.""Solomon Islands and other Pacific island countries are not [the] backyard of any other country.""We are sovereign nations and capable of making our own decisions.""Solomons' opposition leader Matthew Wale had criticised Sogavare's words in Beijing, where he reportedly told Chinese officials ""I am back home"".Wale said it was shocking to hear such a statement on foreign soil in light of Sogavare's pledge during last week's national day celebrations - to pursue an independent foreign policy that does not take sides in the geopolitical struggle between China and the United States.""For a Prime Minister to imply that China is his home is undiplomatic,"" Wale said.He called for Sogavare to quickly clarify his statement.The opposition also said the lack of transparency in the nine new agreements Sogavare has signed with China is ""outrageous"".Wale claimed some government ministers were not aware of the deals and questioned whether Cabinet had agreed to them.On this trip, Sogavare has opened the Solomon Islands embassy in Beijing.Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation reported Sogavare saying the opening of the embassy celebrates China-Solomon Islands relations.""Solomon Islands took the decision to establish relations with its 'eyes wide open',"" he said.""We have not looked back since, and pleased to see the bilateral cooperation between Solomon Islands and China have grown from strength to strength.""

The Australian government says it is ""ready"" to talk to Solomon Islands about its plans for a defence force.On Monday, Solomon's Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare revealed his country's intent to establish a military force due to an inadequately resourced police force.""Solomon Islands over the years have always relied on the presence of foreign police and military force during its internal crisis,"" Sogavare told journalists in Honiara.""Time has come. Time has come for Solomon Islands to empower its police force, invest in stability, and break the dependence it has on external security arrangements.""He said ""China is responding"" to his country's security needs.""We basically need new solutions in dealing with old problems...the country has with all its partners reinforced each other and should not be read in a divisive but rather a cohesive manner by our external partners,"" he said.RNZ Pacific asked the New Zealand and Australian governments whether they would support the Solomon Islands intentions to realise its plans.While the New Zealand government has not commented if it would support Solomon Islands military ambitions, a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said Australia ""respects the right of all nations to make sovereign decisions about their engagement with other countries"".But the spokesperson noted that the decisions made by individual countries could have an impact on others in the region.The Australian government's position, they said, was ""consistent with other regional leaders that the security of the Pacific is the shared responsibility of the Pacific Family"".""As its principal security partner, Australia stands ready to discuss Solomon Islands' security needs and aspirations, when asked"".On Thursday, ABC reported that Australian deputy prime minister Richard Marles was happy to support Solomon Islands plans.""What was indicated to me by the prime minister is that this is a path that Solomon Islands is interested in walking down,"" he said.",21 Jul 2023

The United States has re-opened its embassy in Solomon Islands - almost three decades after downgrading its diplomatic presence in Honiara.Washington had announced its intentions to re-establish its presence in the Pacific nation early last year, following concerns over China's security pact with the Solomons and greater interest in the Pacific.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the opening of the embassy ""symbolises a renewal relationship"" between the two countries.Blinken said it also highlights the strength of their commitment to their bilateral relations, the people of Solomon Islands, and their partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region.He said the US values its shared history and sacrifice with Solomon Islands, and looks forward to continuing to strengthen its partnership in a range of areas, including economic development, combating the Covid-19 pandemic, and addressing the challenges of climate change.He added that the re-opening of the Embassy builds on their efforts not only to place more diplomatic personnel throughout the region, but also to engage further with their Pacific neighbours, connect United States programmes and resources.Meanwhile, the White House has confirmed Russell Comeau will continue to serve as the interim US Chargé d'Affaires.

Solomon Islands hotshot Raphael Lea'i has signed for Bosnian footballing giants FK Velež Mostar, to become the first Solomon Islander to ever sign for a professional European club.Lea'i signed a one-year contract after a successful trial for the club which is known as The Rodeni.The deal includes the possibility of extending the contract for another year.Lea'i began his playing career at Honiara club Henderson Eels FC for whom he played in the OFC Champions League.After playing for the Solomons at various age group levels, Lea'i made his international debut in 2022.Eels president Hudson Wakio said the striker has great discipline and always wants to improve himself.""Raphael is different from most of our players, in terms of self-discipline and his eagerness to push himself. He always challenges and pushes himself on to achieve higher goals.""In Solomon Islands, players train only once a day, usually in the evening, but Raphael trains three times a day.""Wakio said Lea'i's move shows there is a route to professional football for young prospects in Solomon Islands and around the Pacific.""There are many pathways for Solomons players to follow, especially in securing a professional contract. All of these of these partner pathways, they all lead to the same goals or aims, which is to seek a professional contract.""So either going through New Zealand or Australia or tariff to Europe, I think they all lead into the same.""The 19-year-old scored four goals during the Oceania World Cup Qualifying Tournament in March 2022 helping the Solomons reach the final, where they lost to New Zealand.Team coach Felipe Vera-Arango said after the tournament Lea'i was good enough to play in Europe.""He's 19-years-old. It's the first time that he plays in senior level at this level. Before he started the game today he was in the top of the scoring list with Chris Wood, who plays in the Premier League, and he played with pain and he played with a lot of hamstring problems and he tried as hard as he could,"" he said.Solomon Islands captain Micah Lea'alafa said at the time Lea'i has a bright future ahead of him.Velez was one of the most successful clubs in Yugoslavia, finishing runner-up in the national league three times in the 1970s and 80s and reaching the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup in the 1974-75 season.The club has struggled in the post-Yugoslavia environment and played in Bosnia's second tier for several seasons but is back in the Premier League, where they finished third in 2021.

Solomon Islands' internet submarine cable has been damaged affecting broadband and mobile services to parts of the country.Solomon Islands Submarine Cable Company has confirmed to RNZ Pacific that the damage to the cable was caused on Wednesday when a foreign flagged vessel dropped its anchor on it.A spokesperson for the cable company said they are scrambling to get a repair vessel dispatched - most likely from Asia - but it could take three to five weeks to fully repair the cable.Solomon Islands Telekom says broadband, mobile and landline services in the provincial centres of Auki on Malaita, Noro in Western Province and Taro in Choiseul province have been affected.Together the three provinces account for around 41 percent of the country's population.The chief technology officer for the local telco, Michael Palmer, is attempting to boost its satellite and microwave links to provide some connectivity but services will be patchy and slow.Solomon Islands is connected to the Coral Sea Cable System which links the country and Papua New Guinea to the major East Coast Internet Hub in Sydney, Australia.The interruption to internet services could not have come at a more inopportune time for Solomon Islands which is preparing to host the Pacific Games in the capital Honiara later this year.

Much of the Solomon Islands experienced a series of earthquakes on Tuesday and into Wednesday, the most severe being a magnitude 7 quake.The underwater quakes occurred off the west coast of Guadalcanal and initially sparked threats of tsunami, but these were later lifted by the Solomon Islands Meteorological Service and the Pacific Tsunami Centre.The US Geological Survey reports the magnitude 7 quake was 15km deep, just after 1pm Tuesday, local time.A magnitude 6 jolt and ten shallower quakes followed. The Solomon Star reports businesses, government offices and schools being closed in the aftermath and a power outage in Honiara.It says many people moved to higher grounds in case of a tsunami.Part of the ceiling in Honiara's international airport terminal collapsed, and the roof of an annexe fell in at the Australian Embassy.There are also unconfirmed reports of cracks in the parliament building in Honiara.The national broadcaster, the SIBC, was forced off air for 30 minutes by power cuts.Government Minister Peter Shanel said the National Referral Hospital, which is on the water's edge in Honiara, was emptied out, with patients on the road, some in wheelchairs seeking taxis to drive them to higher ground.RNZ Pacific's correspondent in Honiara, Georgina Kekea, said there was some anxiety on the streets from parents rushing to schools to ensure their children were fine.She said the quake knocked over computer monitors and filing cabinets in offices.",23 Nov 2022

Buildings including the international airport and Australia's embassy have been damaged after a series of earthquakes rocked Solomon Islands.The underwater quakes off the coast of Guadalcanal caused power cuts in the capital, Honiara, but so far there have not been any reports of injuries.The first and strongest of the series - at magnitude 7 - was followed by a magnitude 6 and then 5.1 and 4.7 aftershocks.The United States Geological Survey said the first and most severe quake, with a magnitude of 7.0 (initially reported to be 7.3), hit offshore at a depth of 15km, about 16km southwest of the area of Malango.Notable quake, preliminary info: M 7.3 - 19 km SW of Malango, Solomon Islands https://t.co/F3UxYBfKJEA second quake, with a magnitude of 6.0, struck nearby 30 minutes later.""There are no known injuries but the roof of the High Commission annex has collapsed, which would point to likely damage throughout the city,"" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told Parliament.A worker at Honiara International Airport where the ceiling has been damaged but the building was intact told Reuters that aftershocks were still being felt.Airport staff would continue working but the damaged section of the airport terminal was closed to passengers, he said.The Solomon Times newspaper reported power had been cut for most of Honiara, as preliminary assessments of damage to power lines were made.Widespread power outages were also being reported across the island and the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation said on Facebook that all radio services were off air.The National Disaster Management Office said it has received reports that people felt the quake but were waiting for reports of damage.People had been advised to move to higher ground soon after the quake struck.""People in Honiara moved up to higher ground in the minutes after the earthquake but some have now moved down,"" an official told Reuters by phone.The Solomon Islands Meteorological Service said there was no tsunami threat, but has warned about unusual sea currents and was advising people to be vigilant.The US tsunami warning service said early on there could be hazardous tsunami waves possible for coasts within 300km from the quake's epicentre, however, it has since withdrawn the warning.A spokesman from Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare's office, George Hermind said: ""Office tables and computers were thrown all over. It was very scary.""Brian Tom from the National Disaster Management Office said it had had reports of pieces of buildings falling on to cars, and cracks in buildings and on the ground.Tom said residents should stay vigilant as there could be further damage.The National Referral Hospital, located on the water's edge in Honiara, emptied out after the quake.A government minister, Peter Shanel, said patients were on the road, some in wheelchairs, seeking taxis to drive them to higher ground.RNZ Pacific's correspondent in Honiara Georgina Kekea said she was still feeling dizzy from the quake, which knocked over computer monitors and filing cabinets in offices.Kekea said there was a lot of panic along the main street of Honiara when the quake struck.An accurate picture of the extent of the damage would not be known for some time, she said.The government's Attorney-General John Muria (Jnr) showed images on Twitter of the quake's impact on an office.https://twitter.com/Jnr_Muria/status/1594882928810790913The National Emergency Management Authority said there was no forecast tsunami warning for New Zealand after the quake.It said it would keep a close eye on the situation but at this stage there was no immediate threat to Aotearoa.The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre warned earlier government agencies responsible for threatened coastal areas should take action to advise coastal populations at risk.The centre also said tsunami waves were forecast to be less than 0.3m above the tide level for the coasts of Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu.The Solomon Islands sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc along the Pacific Ocean rim where many volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.Today's earthquake comes a day after a shallow 5.6 magnitude quake in the Indonesian province of West Java killed 162 people and injured hundreds more.Rescue workers are continuing to search the rubble to look for survivors of the devastating earthquake that is known to have killed 162 people.The governor of the province, Ridwan Kamil, said more than 13,000 have been displaced from their homes.-RNZ / Reuters",22 Nov 2022

An outspoken former provincial leader in Solomon Islands has been declared unfit for office due to his anti-China stance while in the top job.The former Malaita Premier Daniel Suidani rebelled against the national government's switch in diplomatic ties from Taiwan to Beijing in 2019 and maintained his opposition throughout his tenure as head of one of the most populous and largest provinces on the island.Suidani survived two motions of no confidence against his leadership but lost to a third motion this year.His supporters claim all three were orchestrated and bank-rolled by the Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare's administration - an accusation Honiara has denied.In the latest development, the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation (SIBC) has reported that Daniel Suidani has been disqualified from the Malaita Provincial Assembly by the Minister for Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening, Rollen Seleso.""An executive of a provincial assembly is an agent of the national government and the provincial government is included in the concept of the crown and therefore must always abide by the decisions of the national government,"" Minister Seleso said.The Speaker of the Malaita Provincial Assembly has been advised to officially declare Suidani's seat in ward 5 of Baegu-West Fataleka vacant in accordance with the Provincial Government Act.Reasons for Suidani's disqualification were outlined in a letter dated March 20.According to the SIBC, the first reason was his ongoing refusal to recognise the One China Policy, while the second accused Suidani of colluding with Taiwan in defiance of the sovereign decision of the national government to recognise the One China Policy.Seleso said in Solomon Islands, the national government has a much greater role in governing the country and provincial governments have less autonomy.""The relationship between the provincial and governments is more hierarchical with the national government exercising greater control over all provincial governments,"" he said.Rollen Seleso also advised Daniel Suidani of his right to petition the High Court of Solomon Islands to seek relief against the declaration.In response, Suidani said he refused to be cowed by what he termed ""abuse of the law"" and said he would challenge the decision.""I believe since in the past the courts have been perceived to be robust. It will be shown in the end that the Minister acted outside of its (sic) powers and abused his office,"" he said.Suidani said that he would continue to stand against the abuse of the state by the minister who he said thinks he can use the law to fulfil the government's ""reckless political agenda"".""This abuse will be exposed for the world to see for themselves,"" he added.",6 Apr 2023

The US Department of State has provided $US1 million to help clear the Solomon Islands of unexploded World War II bombs before this year's Pacific Games.The State Department has provided funding to The HALO Trust to run the initiative, which will be held in conjunction with the country's Ministry of National Police and the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force.Inside the Games reports this project is part of President Joe Biden's plans to re-establish better relations with the Pacific and help counter the growing influence of China in the region.The US has provided more than $US6.8 million to Solomon Islands since 2011 to help identify and destroy unexploded ordnances (UXO) of World War II.This has included training 13 engineers who have conducted more than 1200 UXO callouts and destroyed more than 29,746 items of unexploded bombs.As part of the latest initiative, the US will work together with Solomon Islands officials to use existing data and historical records, as well as conducting search activities to update the national database.The US funding will also provide technical advice while assisting the Ministry of National Police to establish a UXO coordination office to assist future initiatives.Researchers estimate that every year more than 20 people are killed or seriously injured in the Pacific when one of the thousands of unexploded World War II-era bombs left behind by the US and Japan is set off.In 2020, two men, one British, one Australian, were killed in Solomon Islands helping clear unexploded bombs for the Games.The South Pacific nation was a key battleground and its islands, including Guadalcanal, are littered with remnants from land and sea clashes between Allied and Japanese forces.Earlier this month it was announced that Washington would reopen the United States Embassy in Honiara.The Pacific Games are scheduled to take place from November 19 to December 2.",24 Jan 2023

By Hilda Wayne, Kim Lester, Rachael Lucas and Dan Smith for the ABC's Sistas, Let's TalkLilon Bongmatur's grandfather was just a boy when he was kidnapped from a Vanuatu beach.At first, he and the other children didn't realise the threat. Missionaries and traders were common on Ambrym Island, and they thought nothing of the ship coming towards the beach near the village at Dip Point.By the time they realised, it was too late. Bongmatur's grandfather was taken.From the 1860s until 1901, trading ships from Australia would visit South Pacific islands looking for people to work on plantations.Many were tricked aboard or even kidnapped, in a practice now known as blackbirding.""They were taken against their will,"" Bongmatur told the ABC's Sistas, Let's Talk.""They were treated very badly... they had malnutrition, they had health problems because it was a long journey to Australia.""People like Bongmatur's grandfather were sent to sugar plantations to work in hostile conditions for almost no money. Some were not paid at all.Fifteen percent of those blackbirded to Australia died from exposure to illnesses, malnutrition, or mistreatment.Then in 1901, after Australia became a federation, it passed the White Australia Policy, aimed at banning people of non-European ethnicities from entering or working in the country.The thousands of Pacific Island workers who had been in Australia for decades were suddenly deported.About 1500 people remained and became known as Australian South Sea Islanders.

Displaced and having lost their connections to their island homelands, the South Sea Islanders were left to survive on the fringes of Australian society, and their descendants grew up not really knowing where they came from.For years, their main connection to their past was through oral storytelling.Their grandparents or great-grandparents may have been taken from Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Tuvalu, New Caledonia or Fiji, but they knew very little about the places and people they left behind.But as international travel became more affordable and with the rise of social media, more and more South Sea Islanders re-established connections to their culture and history.And as they find cousins in the Pacific, their Pacific relatives are finally learning what happened to the ancestors who were taken.

While Bongmatur has not found her own relatives in Australia, she is working to help people from the Australian South Sea Islander community connect with their relatives in Vanuatu.""It started way, way back, but I only came in in 2014 when I organised the first family reunion for one of my relatives here,"" she said.""It was an emotional event because the blackbirding days were devastating for our families. It was passed on from generation to generation. And it was hard.""Over the years, people tried to get over what happened.""I guess the reunification is building back that memory and reconnecting values that were taken away.""Sonia Minniecon is a descendant of the First Nations Kabi people and of Australian South Sea Islanders from Vanuatu.She runs an organisation called Blackbird International, which connects South Sea Islanders with their families in the Pacific and runs tours so they can visit their islands.

Her journey began as her parents grew older and became unwell, and she wanted to reconnect for them.""For them, knowing that there were actually people, descendants of uncles or brothers that were taken, still living and alive in Australia... we thought that was such an important part of our family.""We know that our community ... is so large in Queensland and we wanted to help them on their journey to find family. So we established Blackbird International in 2003.""Minniecon's work involves trying to comb through plantation owners' records and shipping records and matching them with oral stories from the islands and other communities.""Once you know who you are and where you come from, it just makes you a whole person,"" she said.""There are still families over there that don't know what happened to their brother or uncle. And the fact that they could even have descendants, you know, cousins, family, just blows people away.

""One story we had was a family here in Australia that had a story that'd been told to them. They weren't sure how true it was, [but] it was about the salt water, their island, and certain animals that connected them.""And we went back to Vanuatu and [there was] a family who had that same story. And that was a direct connection. An oral history from that island and that village, you know, that's how we connect to places through those stories.""Many times, the ship owners just wrote the island from which they were taken. So, in Australia, there were a lot of families with the surname of Ambrym or Obah or Tanna, the islands which they came from.""So that's another way in which we connect families.""Reconnecting families, and the moment they meet, is a time of happiness and joy.For Minniecon herself, returning to her ancestral lands was a beautiful feeling.""I think that it takes a village to raise a child, but when you go back over there, you see that, and you feel it,"" she said.""We had a ceremony for my dad. That was the first time we went back, and they performed what they call a Rom. It's a men's ceremony, so the women shouldn't be a part of that, but because it was for my dad, they were allowed to be part of that ceremony.""Men are dressed ... in their traditional costumes ... and they've got big masks on which are vibrantly coloured, and they've got long cones on their arms with shells and shakers.""We're standing in this circle and there's no one around. You can feel the ground shake because they're coming down and you can hear whistling and noises as they come into the circle and they're dancing. It's like they're floating.""Being a part of that culture, knowing it's yours, was beautiful.""

Since then, Minniecon has helped reunite other families torn apart by blackbirding.When families reunite, she said, although there were sometimes language difficulties, there was joy, happiness, acknowledgement and welcome.""Everyone starts looking at each other's faces and they [see]... the resemblances of people and the names and the similarity.""And I know of others that have gone back and now carry traditional names, which is beautiful.""In the process of rediscovering her own family, Minniecon too found her traditional name.""It's actually Lena. It was my grandmother from Ambrym.""- ABC",8 May 2023

An outbreak of Covid-19 has been declared for Temotu Province in Solomon Islands, with more than 400 cases reported in the nine days to Tuesday morning.The Solomon Times reports that in response, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services has deployed a team of medical and public health workers to the province.The deployment is in response to a request from the provincial Health Service based on the increasing number of cases, critical staff shortages and other gaps in its response to Covid-19 community transmission.The team will provide support to Lata Hospital nurses to manage cases in the isolation ward, support infection prevention and control compliance, and boost their capacity for swabbing, data entry and epidemiological reporting of cases.In addition, risk communication officers have been deployed to support covid safety awareness and communication activities.The Ministry of Health and Medical Services also prepared extra Personal Protective Equipment such as face masks, gowns, face shields, gumboots, and sanitizer for dispatch.World Health Organisation Representative to Solomon Islands, Howard Sobel, said the WHO is committed to supporting the outbreak response and ensuring the health system in Temotu is not overwhelmed.""While Temotu is the last province to experience an outbreak of Covid-19, other provinces should use this as a wakeup call to enhance surveillance and take the necessary measures to prevent a resurgence of Covid-19,"" said Dr Sobel.""The Covid-19 vaccine continues to provide good protection against severe disease and those who have not had the full doses should strongly consider getting vaccinated to protect themselves and their loved ones.""The WHO has also deployed one epidemiologist to support the response team on the ground.",17 Nov 2022

The leader of the parliamentary opposition group in Solomon Islands believes the aid focus by Australia and China should be on development, not guns.It follows the Australian government's donation of 60 MK-18 assault rifles and a fleet of vehicles to the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF), earlier this month.A few days later China made its own police donation - two armoured trucks with mounted Water Cannons and a fleet of dozens of other police vehicles and motorbikes.Opposition leader Matthew Wale says in a country where the main hospital is often lacking even the most basic medicine it does not make sense to allocate so much overseas aid to security.""I was at a funeral of a relative last week who died from a lack of panadol to bring his temperature down, so this is the situation at the national referral hospital, basic medicine is lacking and yet we are investing in guns, water canons and the likes.""""Today's handover of vehicles are at the request of the Solomon Islands government,"" said the Chinese Ambassador to Solomon Islands, Li Ming.""It will further enhance the capacity and capability building of the RSIPPF and further contribute to the law and order management of Solomon Islands.""The ambassador said the policing cooperation between the countries is in the interests of the two countries and benefits the region as a whole.During the handover ceremony Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavere said, ""I am aware that the support geared towards RSIPF continues to focus on improving its capability and the strengthening of its capacity. This is to enhance the ability of RSIPF to respond to law and order issues, especially in relation to public order.""After the government revealed the receipt of weapons and vehicles from Australia, Matthew Wale, called it ""very disturbing"" and asked why the police force needs high-powered guns.Wale said Solomon Islands has a dark history with guns, and with recent events involving the public demonstrating their frustration against the government, the weapons could be used against the country's citizens.",9 Nov 2022

A report on women's health in Solomon Islands has revealed that unsafe abortion practices is a serious public health issue.The Solomon Islands Planned Parenthood Association (SIPPA) study surveyed women across the Solomons to gather their personal experiences with abortion and contraception.In Solomon Islands, contraception use for women of reproductive age was last measured at 27 percent in 2013, and has decreased over time.Unless the mother's life is at stake, abortion is illegal in Solomon Islands. This has led to some women seeking backstreet abortions for unwanted pregnancies.Pacific Director of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), Chris Golden, said due to contraception being widely frowned upon, women are given unreliable information leading to drastic situations upon falling pregnant.""There's a lot of misconceptions about contraception,"" he said.""There are concerns about how does somebody manage their sexual health attitudes. For example, one woman said she was told that when she had an unwanted pregnancy, one of the advices from a family member was to climb a tree and jump out of it, because that would induce an abortion.""That's terrible advice and this is like the sort of thing that we often work against.""Gendered norms and violence restricts women's right to choose to when to start a family.Through focus groups discussions, the report noted that women who were married or in a relationship were forbidden to use contraception due to their partner's embedded cultural or religious views.Women neglecting themselvesClinical nurse Hiulyn Vozoto said too often women in partnerships neglect their own ambitions.""The biggest challenge women face in Solomon Islands is decision-making,"" she said.""Decision-making and whatever plans or whatever decision in their home they always depend on the husband - they never make their own decision. That's one of the challenges I see with the women in Solomon Islands.""Participants in the report shared that unwanted pregnancies drive women to either seek unsafe termination methods, abandoning the baby, or suicide.President of the National Women's Council, Ella Kahue, said because of the shame and stigma, abortion isn't openly discussed which she said also poses a risk to women's lives.""Abortion here, is not a talked-about issue and in itself is life-threatening for young girls or anyone who engage in that. When we talk about abortion, it is done in secrecy.""Organisations and health providers are hopeful that the report will improve government and civil society responses to unwanted pregnancies as well as invest in more community-based programs that empower women to make informed choices.

Solomon Islands has signalled it will not sign on to an 11-point declaration between the United States and Pacific Island nations this week, dealing a blow to the White House ahead of a high-profile presidential summit with Pacific leaders in Washington.The ABC has been told that Washington and Pacific Island countries have spent recent weeks negotiating a new joint statement on the partnership between the US and the Pacific states.The declaration is designed to provide a framework for intensified US engagement in the Pacific.Washington is moving to ramp up its diplomatic, development and commercial presence in the region, partly in response to China's growing influence in several Pacific nations.Some Pacific leaders have described the declaration as being ""similar"" in intent to a more sweeping trade and security deal which China unsuccessfully pursued with ten Pacific Island nations in May.Washington's proposal covers issues including strengthening US-Pacific ties, tackling climate change, sustainable development, security and preserving the rules-based international order.Several Pacific nations are expecting to sign the declaration during the historic meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House on 28 and 29 September.It's the first time Pacific nations have been invited to Washington for an in-person summit.However, several sources stressed that negotiations over the joint declaration are still ongoing.The ABC has also been told that Solomon Islands sent a diplomatic note to other Pacific Island nations on Monday, announcing it will not sign up to the declaration this week, and stressing there was no consensus over the document.The note also said Solomon Islands needed more time to reflect on the proposal, and that the declaration would have to be considered by its national parliament.The move is likely to consolidate anxieties in both Canberra and Washington about the trajectory of Solomon Islands under Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, who has repeatedly berated traditional partners including Australia and New Zealand, while drawing closer to China.

He said it focused on bolstering Pacific regionalism, tackling climate change, advancing economic growth, and supporting disaster preparation and response.It also includes addressing Covid-19 and other health concerns, responding to the legacies of war in the Pacific and promoting nuclear non-proliferation.Washington has been increasingly uneasy about the way China has expanded commercial and security links in the Pacific, suggesting it could undermine sovereignty across the region.Earlier this year, China sought a multilateral trade and security deal with 10 Pacific nations, but this was shelved at a meeting between Beijing and Pacific leaders in May.Samoan Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa said the agreements were similar in intent, but added that the US had been more willing to negotiate with the Pacific as a whole.Initially, only Pacific countries that had formal diplomatic ties with the US were invited to this week's summit, which excluded Cook Islands, Niue, New Caledonia or French Polynesia.However the invitation was extended to those countries, as well as Australia and New Zealand, after lobbying from Pacific Island leaders.""We've been insisting that if partners wish to talk to us, collectively, then they need to do it through the modalities of the Pacific [Islands] Forum,"" Fiame said.""When the Chinese were proposing something similar, we were giving them that message, but it didn't seem to filter through or they weren't willing to take that on board.""Earlier this year Solomon Islands also signed a deeply controversial security pact with Beijing, although Sogavare has repeatedly ruled out allowing China to establish a military presence in the country.It's not clear what impact Solomon Islands' decision to hold off on the declaration will have on negotiations over the text.Several other Pacific nations have welcomed increasing US engagement in the region, while also making it clear that it must be on their terms.Federated States of Micronesia President David Panuelo said there had been a ""very involved process"" to develop the document, which was initiated by the White House.""Our officials have been going back and forth with the United States,"" Panuelo said.

Fiame said the declaration between Pacific countries and the US was ""pretty general"" and prioritised climate change, which is seen as the region's biggest security threat.She said there were also significant discussions about maritime security.""Not only the protection of the fisheries, but also the maritime boundaries,"" she said.The Samoan prime minister pressed the importance of maintaining peace in the region, and said she would not like to see increased US military presence in the Pacific.""When you begin to talk about defence, you're sort of looking at scenarios where other countries or forces will be coming into the Pacific,"" she said.""We wouldn't like to encourage that in any way.""Other nations are pushing for more economic investment from the US.""Our biggest investment partner right now is China … it shouldn't be that way,"" said Palau President Surangel Whipps Junior.""We don't even have diplomatic relations with China. But the number one investors are coming from China. Before Covid-19, the number one tourists were from China.""Whipps said climate change was stifling his country's economic development.""Palau was actually making some progress, I'd say in 2010,"" he said.""We were on the right trajectory to go somewhere, then what do we get here? Three typhoons in the last 10 years, which we never had before.""Every time we tried to dig ourselves out of the hole, we've got problems with climate change that send us backwards.""Whipps said he hoped the meeting with Biden would be ""more than just a photo opportunity at the White House"".""I hope it's substantial programmes and initiatives that really build that partnership,"" he said.Director of the Lowy Institute's Pacific Islands Program Meg Keen agreed the US summit with Pacific leaders was very significant, but must lead to real outcomes.""The signing of the declaration is important because it's a signal. But more important is what actually gets delivered over time,"" Dr Keen said.""There have been promises, in fact, on a number of these types of topics in the past, and there hasn't been strong delivery.""She said it was encouraging to see US open embassies in Pacific Island nations, including Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Tonga.But financing promises made in this week's summit would be a challenge for Washington, she said.""Those commitments have to be translated into action, and that needs financing, and the financing has to go to Congress and it has to be approved,"" she said.""There can be quite a lag time between the provenance and the delivery.""Dr Keen said there were key differences between the US-Pacific declaration and China's proposed trade and security deal with the region.""There's some overlap, and we can see that in climate change, economic development, and so on,"" she said.""I think what the United States is trying to show is a strong commitment to development, and they're trying to pull back on security.""The regional proposal with the Pacific [and China] … had a much stronger security element to it.""- ABC[h] Related",28 Sep 2022

Solomon Islands Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele says the country joined an agreement with the US only after changes to wording relating to China.He says the country does not want to be forced to choose sides, and the Pacific should be seen as a region of peace and cooperation.Manele was in Wellington today for an official meeting with his New Zealand counterpart Nanaia Mahuta, and was welcomed to Parliament with a pōwhiri this morning.Solomon Islands has been a central focus in discussions over partnerships and security in the region after it signed a partnership agreement with China in April.After a draft of the agreement was leaked in March, New Zealand had described it as ""gravely concerning"", but the full text of the final document has never been made public.The United States has been working to contain China's growing influence with Pacific countries, and last week brought leaders of 12 Pacific nations to Washington DC for two days with the aim of finalising a new Pacific strategy with a joint declaration of partnership.Solomon Islands had initially refused to sign the declaration, which covered 11 areas of cooperation, but later agreed after a requirement for Pacific Island states to consult with each other before signing security deals with regional impacts was removed.Manele clarified that decision when questioned by reporters this afternoon.""In the initial draft there were some references that we were not comfortable with, but then the officials under the discussions and negotiations ... were able to find common ground, and then that took us on board, so we signed,"" he said.Asked what specifically they were uncomfortable with, he confirmed it related to indirect references to China.""There was some references that put us in a position that we would have to choose sides, and we don't want to be placed in a position that we have to choose sides.""He said the Solomons' agreement with China was domestically focused and did not include provision for a military base.""My belief ... and my hope is this - that the Pacific should be a region of peace, of co-operation and collaboration, and it should not be seen as a region of confrontation, of conflict and of war,"" he said.""And of course we are guided by the existing regional security arrangements that we have in place - and these are the Biketawa declaration as well as the Boe declaration.""We welcome the US re-engagement with the Pacific and we look forward to working with all our partners.""After securing its partnership agreement, US officials acknowledged they had let the relationship with Pacific nations ""drift"" in recent years, and there was more work to do.

Manele said he was ""delighted"" to be in Aotearoa for the first time in about eight years, after his previous plans to visit two years ago were put on hold by the Covid-19 pandemic, and thanked New Zealand for support in helping manage and contain the virus, including with vaccines and medical equipment.He said the discussion between the ministers covered the RSE scheme, the need to review the air services agreement, the 2050 Blue Pacific strategy, and maritime security.He was keen to stress the importance of increased flights between New Zealand and Solomon Islands.""I think this is important, we are tasking our officials to start a conversation, we'll be writing formally to the government of New Zealand to review the air services agreement that we have between our two countries,"" he said.""This will not only facilitate the RSE scheme but I hope will also facilitate the movement of investors and business people and general tourism.""The country was also hopeful of more diplomatic engagement with New Zealand.""Not only at the officials level but also at the ministerial level and at the leaders level, and your Prime Minister has an invitation to my Prime Minister to visit New Zealand in the near future, and my Prime Minister is looking forward to visiting.""

Australia stepped in to contribute $US394,000 for the cup after, Vanuatu, failed to meet its commitment of 60 percent of the total budget.RNZ Pacific's correspondent reports Prime Minister, Bob Loughman, promised to donate $US771,000 for the event.But the MSG secretariat in Port Vila has said, so far, Vanuatu has not met its commitment.The promise was made before the dissolution of parliament last month ahead of a snap election, and now with a caretaker administration in place, there is no ability to make any financial commitment.The MSG secretariat said to complete the event they are reliant on donations.The Australian High Commisssioner, Heidi Bootle, said: ""Sport has the power to bring communities together, and supports us to lead healthy lives. Australia is very pleased to be an Official Partner of this event and it has been an honour for us to work with Vanuatu, MSG and the organising committee.""Loughman thanked Australia and said despite the issues in the Melanesian countries, they have one thing in common and that is the unity of the people.He said ""togetherness, cultural values brings us together, this is one the element that combine us together in our community.The tournament, which was originally called the Melanesian Cup, hasn't taken place for 22 years, due to a lack of funding, but it's been resurrected by the government of Vanuatu and FIFA under its new name.The secretary of the MSG Prime Minister's Football Cup competition Henry Bill, said although it's separate from the main world cup qualifying tournaments, participation will affect teams' international rankings.""Looking at the Melanesian Cup before, not all countries participated because it was not compulsory and it wasn't organised by FIFA.""This time around the Melanesian Cup is tier one competition re-organised by FIFA and it is compulsory for everyone to attend given that it will affect their rankings.""Papua New Guinea, the Vanuatu National football team and its development team are in Pool A, while Fiji, New Caledonia and Solomon Islands are in Pool B.In the final, held on 30 September, Papua New Guinea defeated the Vanuatu development team in a penalty shoot-out, 4-1.At fulltime the score was 3-3 at the Korman Stadium, in Port Vila. ",18 Sep 2022

Solomon Islands says consultation between Pacific nations could be improved, ahead of a foreign affairs bilateral meeting in New Zealand.The Solomons' Foreign Affairs Minister Jeremiah Manele will sit down with his Aotearoa counterpart Nanaia Mahuta in Wellington today.Pacific Security expert Anna Powles said Mahuta would be looking to solidify bilateral relations between the two nations after intense geopolitical scrutiny over the Solomons-Beijing security pact.""There'll certainly be a sense that New Zealand needs to ensure it has strong, robust and open channels of communication with the Solomon Islands going forward in the relationship,"" Powles said.News of a draft security agreement between China and Solomon Islands caught the New Zealand government by surprise in March.Speaking at Te Herenga Waka (Victoria University of Wellington)'s law school last night, Manele reiterated the Solomon Islands' ""friends to all, enemies to none"" policy.""We work with any partner that gives us a fair go,"" he said.However, he did say consultation in the Pacific region could be improved.""I think there is room and space to further enhance our bilateral consultations... not only at officials level but also at the ministerial level.""Manele added while regional frameworks, like the annual Pacific Islands Forum, facilitated consultation, it was important sovereign nations could make independent decisions.""Of course while there are regional frameworks for consultation, flexibility must also be there for sovereign states to also consult and pursue their interests as they see fit.""The United States has made concerted efforts to counter China's influence in the Pacific in recent months.Last week, leaders of 14 Pacific nations were hosted at a historic US-Pacific Summit in Washington for two days of talks and a dinner at the White House.Manele said Solomon Islands welcomed America's renewed interest and engagement in the Pacific region, including an 11-part partnership declaration it signed.""We look forward to the implementation of that arrangement and the commitments that have been made by the US in terms of its interest and engagement in the region.""Manele said the Solomons would continue to deal with its economic challenges, fast-growing youth population and security issues through a ""development lens"".He said he ""remained determined"" to increase the number of people allowed to work in New Zealand through the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme to aid its recovery from the pandemic.""We have lost a lot of ground due to Covid-19.

During the second reading of the Constitution Amendment Bill 2022 the Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare reiterated his reasoning for the extension.""The democratic coalition government is steadfast in its decision to delay the dissolution of this current house. The reasons are simple and we have consistently said this since day one,"" Sogavare said.""We cannot successfully host the national general elections and the Pacific Games in the same year while our economy is still recovering from the impacts of Covid-19 and the damage caused by public unrest.""But this was disputed by the leader of opposition Matthew Wale in his contribution to the ensuing debate saying he saw no reason why both events couldn't be held in the same year.""This bill is the result of a scheme by the prime minister to remain in power for longer than is necessary at the cost of the voters' right to exercise their votes at the general election in 2023."" Matthew Wale said.He accused the prime minister of trying to hide the fact that his cabinet had approved the deferrment of parliament in February 2021.""Since 2021 the prime minister schemed to not allocate resources to the electoral commission for elections preparations in the normal manner.""""Sir government did not undertake any meaningful, objective public consultations on the cabinet decision of February 2021...government by secrecy Sir is government by deception,"" said Matthew Wale.Manasseh Sogavare denied Wale's accusations in his closing remarks before the bill passed its second reading.Adding to the controversy surrounding the bill was the urgency with which the prime minister pushed the legislation through the house.After passing its second reading and progressing through the committee of the whole house, a motion was moved by the chairman of the Bills and Legislation Committee, John Maneniaru, for the bill to undergo the scrutiny of his parliamentary committee. The motion was defeated by the government.

Manasseh Sogavare's core argument for tabling the constitutional amendment - a lack of funding - was scuttled this week after Australia's foreign minister Penny Wong revealed they had offered to help fund the election in 2023.And while Honiara has yet to officially respond to Canberra's offer of election funding support, Sogavare slammed the timing of minister Wong's statement.""It was announced on the day that this bill was read for the first time,"" Sogavare said.""The announcement by the Australian foreign affairs minister is seen by the government of Solomon Islands as an attempt to directly interfere Mr Speaker into our domestic affairs.""Especially when this is a matter that is before this very house,"" he said.Timing aside, the opposition leader Matthew Wale asked if election funding was now no longer an issue what then was the motive for delaying the election?""There never was any need to choose between whether to hold the general elections or host the Pacific Games. We can and should hold both in 2023,"" said Wale.""It is an abuse of process and a hijacking of the people's right to exercise their vote.""Having now been passed the dissolution of Solomon Islands parliament in 2023 has been deferred from May to December, delaying the national election to early in 2024 and effectively giving Sogavare's DCGA government more time in office.Sogavare remains adamant the move is a practical exercise reflecting the economic realities of a country emerging from the global pandemic.But Wale warned it sets a dangerous precedent for future governments.

Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare says his nation has been unfairly targetted since it formalised diplomatic relations with China in 2019.The leader has been under pressure after signing a controversial security pact with China in April.Sogavare told the United Nations General Assembly that Solomon Islands has been subjected to a barrage of unwarranted and misplaced criticisms, misinformation, and intimidations that threatens its democracy and sovereignty.""Solomon Islands has been vilified in the media since formalising its relationship with China. This decision was reached through democratic processes by a democratically elected government"", he said.Sogavare said nations needed to respect his country's sovereignty and democracy.He said Solomon Islands adopted a 'friends to all and enemies to none' foreign policy.Tuvalu's Prime Minister Kausea Natano said it was regrettable that Taiwan continued to be kept out of the United Nations systems.In his address to the UN General Assembly, he said Tuvalu had significantly benefitted from its partnership with Taiwan.He said Tuvalu supported the re-admission of Taiwan into the UN as a founding member of the United Nations, and for its active participation in UN specialised agencies.""We must not sideline Taiwan, a vibrant democracy that has made significant progress on all the Sustainable Development Goals and is ready to contribute more in global efforts in achieving the SDGs"", he said.Tuvalu, Palau, Nauru and the Marshall Islands have diplomatic ties with Taiwan.Solomon Islands terminated its diplomatic link with Taiwan in 2019 while Kiribati recognised Taiwan between 2003 and 2019.",27 Sep 2022

A US official said the vessel was unable to enter Honiara for a routine port call because the Solomon Islands government did not respond to a request for it to refuel and provision.But Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said it was a miscommunication.He said there was a delay in granting approval for the vessel to enter, largely due to not receiving the relevant information on time.Approval was granted on August 20 but by the time it was communicated that evening, the Oliver Henry had left Solomon Islands.The government has asked all partner countries with plans to conduct naval visits or patrols to put them on hold until it updates its approval process.Speaking at a ceremony to welcome the visiting United States Hospital Ship, USNS Mercy, in Honiara on Tuesday, Sogavare said there had been a delay in the granting of approval for entry into the country to the US Coast Guard Cutter Oliver Henry due primarily to the appropriate information not being sent to the Office of Prime Minister on time.In relation to a British vessel, HMS Spey, the approval process to enter Solomon Islands was aborted when the Prime Minister's Office received notification from the British High Commission in Honiara that they were no longer seeking approval for the ship to enter the country.The government said the delay in these approvals demonstrates the need for the government to review and refine its approval requirements and procedures for visiting military vessels in Solomon Islands.""To this end, we have requested our partners to give us time to review and put in place our new processes before sending further requests for military vessels to enter the country. Once the new mechanism is in place, we will inform you all. We anticipate the new process to be smoother and timelier,"" Sogavare said.These will universally apply to all visiting naval vessels.Solomon Islands has experienced foreign naval vessels entering the country's waters this year without diplomatic clearance granted.The government said Solomon Islands wants to see a partnership in place to build national capacity to police its Exclusive Economic Zones. Once that process and procedures are in place suspension of naval vessel visits will be lifted.The government has communicated its position to all countries requesting to send naval ships into Solomon Islands' waters.Meanwhile, the Government and people of Solomon Islands welcomed the visit of USNS Mercy which is now in Honiara.The United States Medical team in partnership with the Solomons' Ministry of Health and Medical Services will be carrying out a number of health programmes in Honiara and in some provinces over the next few days.- Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation",31 Aug 2022

Unity and family are key words at the Pacific Islands Forum in Suva this week, but no shows by some island states and the presence of superpowers have disrupted efforts to tackle serious challenges like climate change.In a sign of the growing interest in the geopolitical activity in the region, about 180 journalists from Australasia, Japan, China and the US are there to see how events unfold.""Suva is heaving,"" says Sam Sachdeva, Newsroom's national affairs editor. He says there's been a sobering atmosphere at the forum this week as leaders met face to face for the first time in three years.""I don't think people are mincing words about the scale of the challenge,"" says Sachdeva. ""Having said that, there is optimism.""Fiji prime minister and forum chair Frank Bainimarama in his opening welcome spoke of the region being caught in the crossfire of the ""three deadly C's: Covid, climate and conflict, each factor dangerously compounding the other, that is the inescapable reality of the situation"".On top of that, words used to describe Kiribati's surprise last minute no show have ranged from disappointing to devastating.Many leaders at the forum hope the US-China competition will bind the region rather than pull it apart, but there's also frustration that geopolitics sucks attention away from other problems, says Sachdeva.""There is simply a risk that the more time the nations spend talking about geopolitics and dealing with geopolitics the less time they have to dedicate themselves to climate action, fisheries action and all the other pressing issues for the region,"" he says.Sachdeva tells The Detail why the forum is so important to a region that is made up of many island nations with populations that are smaller than some New Zealand cities and the value of being able to speak with one voice. That has been undermined by Kiribati's withdrawal.""The more leaders who jump out of the forum the more vulnerable it becomes. Yes, it's Kiribati for now, but do other states start to move out and what does that mean in terms of how great powers like the US and China engage with the region?""Tuvalu Foreign Minister Simon Kofe says Kamala Harris' address to the forum and the focus on geopolitics draws attention away from climate change.""If you view it from our perspective you have these superpowers fighting for influence in the region and yet we have countries like Tuvalu fighting for existence. We're on totally different wavelengths,"" he says.Kofe also explains to The Detail about the push to secure the permanency of statehood and claims to maritime zones for Tuvalu and other Pacific countries in the worst case scenario that they will disappear under rising seas.""It's a future-looking initiative and our hope is that the Pacific can get behind that as well.""Find out how to listen and subscribe to The Detail here.  You can also stay up-to-date by liking us on Facebook or following us on Twitter.

International media coverage of Pacific Islands issues is increasing, but the dominant narrative tends to focus on island passivity and vulnerability, recent research says.The data was shared at the East-West Centre's recent conference for media, in Hawaii. The organisation is a research institute aimed at promoting links between the US, Asia and the Pacific.Media had largely taken a colonial and paternalistic approach to Pacific Island stories, the conference heard.But Pacific Conference of Churches general secretary James Bhagwan told the conference that being vulnerable did not have to mean being a victim; he said there was strength in vulnerability, as it meant ownership of a problem.""We need to shift that meta-narrative from victimhood to one of resilience and resistance.""The Climate Warriors shifted the narrative by saying: 'We are not drowning, we are fighting', and I think that was the beginning of a very big shift for the media to start thinking about it from another perspective - but still, we have that focus on victimhood rather that resilience and resistance.""Former Marshall Islands president Hilda Heine earlier told the conference that a ""drowning Pacific Islands"" theme was being over-represented in the media, and the region's efforts in promoting resilience were too often being missed.New Zealand's lack of support for a moratorium to halt deep sea mining activity in the Pacific is disappointing, the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition says.A handful of vocal Pacific nations have called for a moratorium on deep sea mining, including Fiji, Palau and Samoa.Deep Sea Conservation Coalition regional leader Phil McCabe said it was ironic that New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern had met with Pacific leaders at the Pacific Islands Forum summit while New Zealand research agency NIWA was working with The Metals Company, who plan to mine in the Pacific.McCabe estimated that mining in the Pacific would begin in a year.""We're calling on New Zealand to get off their hands - pull their hands out from under themselves and support the Pacific in the growing cause for a moratorium - there's a real urgency of this issue with the activity starting within the year.""All major venues for the 2023 Pacific Games have been built, Solomon Islands Prime Minster Manasseh Sogavare says.Honiara is set to host the 17th Pacific Games, from 19 November to 2 December next year.Sogavare said the Pacific Games was more than sport and draws the region together.Almost 90 percent of the infrastructure for the Pacific Games was already ready, including projects gifted from China, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.""I can assure the other Pacific family that we took our responsibility very seriously ... and we will also provide the best environment for people to come here to put out their potentials to win medals for their countries, Sogavare said.""The games village, was said to have cost $US21.4 million, with the project bankrolled by China, and built by a building firm from China.A criminal complaint has been lodged with police in Samoa over 100,000 tala which has gone missing.The money belonged to Interlinc Samoa, a company that distributes phone credit for a local network company.Police commissioner Auapaau Logoitino Filipo told Radio Polynesia the complaint was filed two weeks ago, and was being referred to the Criminal Investigation Division.The owners of the company found there was an accumulation of money stolen over a period of time, the report said.However Filipo would not comment further, as the investigation was underway.The company was contacted for a comment.Hotel occupancy has quadrupled in the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI).The CNMI Hotel Association released the figures, and said average occupancy rate in its members' 12 hotels averaged 41 percent for June, compared to 10 percent in June 2021.Association chairman Ivan Quichocho said the jump was largely due to athletes arriving for the 2022 Pacific Mini Games, as well as an uptick in visitors from South Korea.There were 23,522 room nights sold, out of 56,960 available during June 2022, though they were going a bit cheaper, at an average of $138.89, compared to $144.61 last June.two major factors played into the four-fold jump in bookings this June compared to June year ago.Quichocho said a year ago there were no direct flights to CNMI from South Korea, but there were 54 this June, after the Tourism Resumption Investment Plan (TRIP) was launched by the government and tourism partners.Quichocho, who is also chairman of TRIP, and a member of the Marianas Visitors Authority board of directors, called for continued support of the tourism office's work in the coming year.""The success of TRIP Korea can be repeated, but the MVA must be supported in order to achieve that.

New Caledonia has officially signed up to a $US180 million loan from France, thereby raising its indebtedness to record levels.The loan agreement was guaranteed by the French state, and was signed in Noumea by the New Caledonian president Louis Mapou, French High Commissioner Patrice Faure and a representative of the French Development Agency.The loan is for 25 years, and the first repayments are due in three years.Faure said while the loan would allow the books to be balanced for 2022, it would be the last one, meaning urgent reforms had become indispensable.He said in the past ten years New Caledonia's ratio of debt to revenue jumped from 35 percent to its current high of 255 percent.Two years ago, a $US245 million loan was given to New Caledonia, but the terms of that loan were not adhered to.Last month, the Territorial Chamber of Accounts warned of a critical situation with the public finances and urged the creation of new revenue streams.The Chamber found that the overall deficit of the social welfare accounts grew five-fold between 2017 and 2020, and social welfare protection schemes were close to defaulting.Tonga's government has rejected complaints on social media made by an American expatriate, who claimed he was being unfairly stopped from leaving the Kingdom.Deputy Prime Minister Poasi Tei released a scathing media statement, in which he said that comments by Jonathan Brent Estren had damaged Tonga's reputation.He said Estren, who was living in the Vava'u islands in Tonga, accused the Ministry of Health of demanding $11,000 for a vaccination shot.And that Estren's claim that aviation officials threatened to confiscate a chartered aircraft that was set to fly him out of Tonga, were false.Tei said vaccinations are free, and an investigation found that Estren and two other expats would not accept the country's state of emergency rules.French Polynesia has recorded another 114 Covid-19 cases in the last 48-hour reporting period.Health authorities said there are now 283 active cases, which means another doubling of numbers in about a week.There no Covid-19 patients currently in hospital.The pandemic eased in French Polynesia a month ago and so far it has been weaker than at the outbreak's peak last year.There have been 649 deaths of people with Covid-19 during the pandemic, with most fatalities registered during last year's Delta outbreak.Vaccinations have continued, and more than 81 percent of people 12 years and older have had two doses.One of the world's largest international training military exercise, the Rim of The Pacific Exercise (RIMPAC), is currently taking place in Hawaii, with more than 25,000 participants from more than 27 countries.The New Zealand Defence Force has sent the HMNZS Manawanui, along with a detachment of ground troops.Royal New Zealand Navy captain Steve Lennick spoke to RNZ from the bridge of the cruiser USS Mobile Bay and said the mission fosters connections between countries, and provides an opportunity for people from the different armed forces to meet each other.""It's fantastic, ... I'm gazing around the Pearl Harbour naval base here, looking at the 38 ships from all over the Indo-Pacific region, and some submarines, and it's quite an atmosphere.""The exercise runs until 4 August.Police in the Solomon Islands town of Auki have arrested ten people at the weekend, in a crackdown on kwaso (illegal alcohol) and consumption of liquor in public.Superintendent Leslie Kili appealed to the community to help police with information on kwaso production and sales of marijuana.He also called on makers to surrender their kwaso distillation equipment.A medical team from New Zealand continues to work alongside medical authorities in Niue, to help stop Covid-19 cases at the border spreading into the community.On Saturday, the Government of Niue reported the country had one new case, and five existing cases, all were at the border. There were no cases in the community.On 28 June, positive cases were detected as part of compulsory day-one testing of passengers who had arrived in Niue the day before, on the first quarantine-free passenger flight from New Zealand.Since then, another quarantine-free flight has arrived from New Zealand.Mission leader Martin Buet, from the NZ Ministry of Health, said the team was supporting Niue's medical experts.""The idea and the request was ... to give some surge support to the team here in Niue.""It put them under, I wont says stress but the same people had to do multiple jobs and obviously this was an extra burden to them at this point.""",11 Jul 2022

Deafness is one of the most common disabilities reported in the country, and with little support available it often leads to high levels of poverty-related disease and extreme isolation for deaf people.The new sign language project aims to address these problems by normalising the use of sign language and increasing the use of it.Representatives from the Australian Catholic University (ACU) and the Catholic Education Authority in Honiara are leading the project.They will train deaf and hearing people across the Solomons in Australian Sign Language, before sending them into remote communities where deaf children and young adults live.Sister Maria Fe Rollo, who serves at the Honiara San Isidro Care Centre for disabled children, said the deaf were often left behind despite some of them developing their own unique ways of communicating.""Many who are still out there in the communities really live in isolation because of this barrier in communication.""There is the home sign that they've developed with the family, but there is also limitation into that kind of communication which may be helpful in their family or their immediate community, but when they go to a bigger community they are left out.""

Project lead Dr Mellita Jones, who is an associate professor at ACU, said relatives of deaf children and the wider community were being encouraged to learn to sign.""We're not just restricting it to children, we're also running sessions after school so that parents and families can come and learn sign language.""It's just about that connection with people - it's a human condition that we connect with one another.""

Trainees of the project will be able to earn a Certificate of Teaching and Learning from the university, recognised by the Solomon Islands' Ministry of Education for employment in schools or other institutions.Catholic Education Authority director Modesta Hasiau said the qualification will address the shortage of disabled learning teachers.""We only have a limited number of teachers who are passionate, they were only passion-driven but they are not qualified teachers. Even the Technical Teachers College doesn't also address that need, so ... we are working to bridge that gap in that area as well.""
Modesta Hasiau says there is a lack of qualified disabled learning teachers at present.

Former school principal Jackson Meke said implementing inclusive education in the past had been difficult given the limited resources and funding.He said the sign language project was a starting point for the Solomons government to take inclusive education more seriously.""There is very little effort in implementing or preparing schools in Solomon Islands to address inclusive education for students with general disabilities,"" he said.""When I was the principal we tried our best to address an individual case at our school with vision impairment and it is quite expensive to have even one student to try and treat him differently, and that is something that the government needs to know.""
Jackson Meke says the programme is desperately needed.

With the Solomon Islands international border now open, Dr Jones said she was looking forward to working first-hand with deaf children and their communities.""There's a lack of empowerment for many people, and so for me, working with deaf people who feel so isolated in their communities - I think that's a really unique way [to] try and get some empowering educational opportunities, and I'm really driven by that.

In addition to the possible new police training facility in the Solomons, China will also help Samoa build a fingerprint lab to go with the construction of an already announced new police academy.Solomon Islands Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele announced the proposal during his Chinese counterpart's visit to Honiara on Thursday.""China… will further a consider a proposal… for a police training centre and support towards police infrastructure and assets given the country's fragile security environment,"" Manele said during a press conference that was boycotted by local media.China's foreign minister is currently on an eight-nation tour of the Pacific, during which he is seeking a sweeping regional deal on security and trade, ahead of a group foreign ministers meeting with 10 Pacific nations in Fiji on Monday.Wang met with Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa on Saturday and discussed regional priorities of climate change, Covid-19 and security.After the meeting, Samoa's government released a statement announcing China would help build a new fingerprint laboratory in addition to the previously announced construction of a police academy.""China is a key development partner for Samoa providing infrastructural developments in the health, education, and public administration sectors, human resource development, sports development, and technical cooperation in the agriculture sector,"" the Samoa government said in a statement issued after the meeting.""Key to the bilateral relations between China and Samoa is the adherence to the one-China principle,"" the statement said.The proposal for a Chinese-funded police training centre in Solomon Islands mirrors that of a 2020 promise to build a police school in Samoa, as China seeks to increase its influence in the region through police training support.In March, Solomon Islands police published pictures of their officers brandishing replica assault rifles donated by the Chinese government, as part of a new police training programme run by Chinese police.At the time, there were questions over the legality of the shipment of the replica guns, as well as the future implications of such firearms training.Experts and opposition politicians believe the move to bring in replica arms clearly suggested the police force was planning to bring in real weapons from China in the future.Australian officials are also warning that China might encourage more brutal and confrontational tactics to put down local protests, inflaming existing political and ethnic tensions.Earlier this week, it was revealed China is hoping to strike a deal with 10 Pacific nations during Wang's tour of the region.The sweeping agreement covers everything from security to fisheries and is seen by at least one Pacific leader as an attempt by Beijing to wrest control of the region.A draft communique and five-year action plan sent by Beijing to 10 Pacific nations prompted pushback from the leader of the Federated States of Micronesia, who said it showed China's intent to control the region and ""threatens regional stability"".News of the proposed deal follows last month's announcement of a new security pact between Solomon Islands and China, in a move that has concerned traditional regional partners such as the US and Australia, as well as intelligence officials.That pact has raised fears that China could send troops to the island nation or even establish a military base there, not far from Australia.Solomon Islands and China say there are no plans for a base.Wang's Pacific tour coincides with Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong's own visit to the Pacific, meeting with Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama on Friday in her first official trip to the region since being sworn in last week.- ABC",29 May 2022

A leaked draft of the security agreement contains a provision that would allow Chinese naval deployments to the Solomons.At a news conference in Honiara following his meeting with the Solomons foreign minister Jeremiah Manele, Wang said the agreement has not been imposed on anyone, nor is it targeted at any third party.Wang also said China respected existing international relationships with Pacific countries and would explore joining three-way partnerships with them.Australia's former government, toppled in 21 May elections, had said that any move to create a Chinese military base would amount to crossing a ""red line"" without specifying the consequences.New Zealand and the United States have also expressed concern about the security arrangement between China and Honiara.But Wang countered: ""China's cooperation with Pacific Island countries does not target any country and should not be interfered or disrupted by any other country.""He also took a swipe at previous Australian governments which described the Pacific Islands as being in the country's ""backyard"".""They are not the backyard of anyone. All the Pacific Island countries are entitled to make their own choice instead of being just mere followers of others,"" he said.""Any smears and attacks on the normal security cooperation between China and Solomon Islands are not above the board and any such disruption will not get anywhere.""Wang appeared to extend an olive branch to other Pacific powers, though, saying China respected existing international relationships with Pacific Island countries and would explore joining three-way partnerships with them.The security pact helps the Solomon Islands government to safeguard stability and long term security, he said, ""in light of the needs and requests by the Solomon Islands to carry out law enforcement and security cooperation"".It also entails ""capacity building"" for the police force.Last November, protests against Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare's rule flared into riots in the capital Honiara, during which much of the city's Chinatown was torched.The unrest ""gravely threatened the life and property of the Chinese community in this country,"" Wang said.China sent anti-riot equipment and an ""ad-hoc police advisory group"" at the request of Honiara, he said, as well as sealing the security agreement.It aimed to build Solomon Islands' law enforcement capacity and safeguard its security, he said and ""at the same time, more effectively protect the Chinese nationals and institutions"".",27 May 2022

Mr Kilu said some people do not wish to be vaccinated but the government and the Department of Health continue to demand that every eligible person must be vaccinated.He said not only is there no legal basis for the mandatory push on vaccines, but it also appears to be a breach of fundamental rights and freedoms under article 5 of the constitution.The lawyer said if there is no response to his letter court proceedings will ensue.There is a political upheaval in Tonga with the ousting of three MPs after they were found guilty of attempting to bribe voters during the run-up to the 2021 general elections.Each was found guilty in separate rulings made by Tonga's Supreme Court in the space of a week.Successful election petitions filed against the former prime minister, Pohiva Tu'i'onetoa, and Internal Affairs Minister, Sangstar Saulala, found both men guilty of bribing voters while campaigning for the election last year.A third MP, Tatafu Moeaki the People's Representative for Tongatapu 4, and Minister of Finance had his election declared void, in a judgment by the Supreme Court.Meanwhile, a petition in Tonga to unseat MP, Tevita Puloka, has failed.The petition had been filed by Siaosi Pohiva, who ran against Puloka during the election for Tongatapu's constituency number 1.A deputy police commissioner in Solomon Islands says there is no truth in local reports that some officers plan a sit-in protest.This follows concerns the police would strike over a delay in the payment of their Covid-19 allowances.Deputy Commissioner Ian Vaevaso said these media reports are wrong.He said he thinks very few unruly officers are tarnishing the good image of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force by speaking to the media.Mr Vaevaso said making unnecessary comments to the media is a serious breach for an officer.",7 May 2022

If we want to interview our foreign affairs minister, we can just do it without the event. What is the purpose of hosting such an event for the press when they are only allowed one question and directed to their foreign minister only?""Kekea said even the discriminatory manner in which journalists were selected to cover the event did not bode well with the association.""MASI thrives on professional journalism and sees no reason for journalists to be discriminated against based on who they represent. Giving credentials to selected journalists is a sign of favouritism.

In return, the Solomon Islands government said it would purchase six aircraft from AVIC Commercial Aircraft, a subsidiary of the Chinese state-owned defence behemoth which has built small and medium-sized aeroplanes to be sold to developing countries.The proposed exchange was laid out two-and-a-half years ago in a memorandum of understanding (MOU), which has been obtained by the ABC.The document was signed by Solomon Islands Minister for Communication and Aviation Peter Shanel Agovaka at Yanliang, near Xi'an in central China, in November 2019, only a few months after the Pacific Island country switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taiwan.Chinese state media reported that the minister also delivered an address at a major aviation conference which AVIC hosted in Yanliang, hailing cooperation with the company as an ""opportunity and way forward"" for Solomon Islands.However, it does not appear that either AVIC or the Solomon Islands government pushed ahead with any of the initiatives in the MOU after signing it.Solomon Airlines currently operates only one international aircraft - an Airbus A320 - and has not moved to buy any new planes from the Chinese firm.It runs three smaller Twin Otter and one Dash 8 aircraft for domestic routes.When the ABC contacted the chief executive of Solomon Airlines, Brett Gebers, he said he was unaware of the agreement.""I discussed this MOU with the board and, as it has not yet been presented to the board, the chairman said that he will contact the MCA [Ministry of Communication and Aviation] to find out more about it,"" he told the ABC.""I was half-heartedly invited to accompany a group of MPs to China around this time in 2019 but nothing ever came of it. There was mention of looking at aeroplanes.""That stands in stark contrast to the sweeping vision laid out in the MOU, which declares: ""Solomon [Islands] wishes to be part of the regional airline concept where Honiara would receive direct flights from China and become a regional hub.""""For this vision, Solomon [Islands] needs to acquire new planes, such as MA600/MA700 and Y-12 aircraft and refurbish airfields,"" it said.The MA600 is a relatively new turboprop plane which AVIC Commercial Aircraft has already sold to a number of countries, including Laos and Benin.The MOU said the sale would ""depend on the further negotiations on price and concessional terms"" and would require ""ultimate approval of the board of Solomon Islands and the government of Solomon Islands"".The MOU also laid out an ambition to upgrade almost three dozen airstrips across Solomon Islands, and said the purchase of planes would be ""in combination and is linked to facilitating the upgrade of Solomon Islands domestic airfields in two phases.""For Phase One, up to 15 airfields; for Phase Two, the remaining 20 airfields"".But again, there is no evidence that any of this work has begun.The MOU was one of six agreements signed by Solomon Islands and China in the aftermath of Honiara's decision to abandon its relationship with Taiwan and establish diplomatic ties with Beijing.Earlier this month, China and Solomon Islands announced they had signed a security pact, stoking regional fears that Beijing might be intent on establishing a military presence in the Pacific Island nation.Graeme Smith from the Australian National University told the ABC there was a ""great deal of urgency in the [aviation] agreement … far more urgency than you find in many MOUs between China and the Pacific"".He said the plan likely stalled because of the pandemic, which smashed the global airline industry and shut down most air travel into both countries.""I suspect mainly what stopped it from happening is Covid-19, because it was signed in November 2019 [just before the pandemic] and all the time lines … would have gone quickly out of the window,"" he said.""The requirements for this agreement to kick in would have required both a visit to China by the Solomon Islands side and a visit to Solomon Islands from the Chinese side, both of which would have been very difficult to manage after February 2020.""Dr Smith said AVIC may have sensed a commercial opportunity to sell planes to Solomon Islands on favourable terms which were effectively subsidised by Chinese state financial institutions.But he said there was also a clear ""strategic push"" animating the MOU.""In the first instance, this is a state-owned enterprise responding to a signal from its government to do things that are strategically in line with China's goals,"" he said.Dr Smith believed it was also worth noting that AVIC's commercial arm was deeply intertwined with the Chinese military, which might have an interest in scoping out airfields and other facilities in Solomon Islands.""Defence planners (in Australia) might be somewhat concerned at the involvement of this company. I think their concerns might be how readily information could be conveyed back to the Chinese military through this commercial enterprise,"" he said.""But we're getting into the realm of speculation. Is this company going to build a base in Solomon Islands? Probably not, it's not really what they do. But certainly, they have extremely strong ties to the Chinese military.""Several countries are already working on airport infrastructure in Solomon Islands.Australia and New Zealand have agreed to upgrade runways on Taro Island near Choiseul Bay and Seghe Airport on the New Georgia Islands, while New Zealand has previously funded airport upgrades at the towns of Munda and Gizo.Japan and the World Bank are also currently funding an upgrade of the runway of Honiara International Airport.The ABC has tried repeatedly to contact both Agovaka and AVIC Commercial Aircraft for comment, but neither have yet responded.-ABC",29 Apr 2022

Australia is referred to by President Bush, I think as the as the deputy sheriff of the United States in the Pacific.""A senior journalist in Honiara said Solomon Islanders were being treated disrespectfully and kept in the dark over the government's security pact with China.

Speaking at a panel on the contentious treaty, Dorothy Wickham said most of the news coverage on the security arrangement has been focused on Australia and America's positions.""The government's handling of the way it went about handling this treaty shows disrespect ... to Solomon Islanders that there was no discussion, no consultation,"" she said.""Even a press release on the eve of the signing would have been a standard procedure and until today we have not had a press briefing or a press statement for a press briefing from the prime minister's office,"" Wickham added.She said the government had not meaningfully engaged with journalists to ensure that they could inform Solomon Islanders about what the security deal meant for them.Wickham said local media had been struggling to refocus the narrative so that it was about Solomon Islands.Meanwhile, New Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said discussions on a security agreement signed between China and Solomon Islands needed to be inclusive of other Pacific nations.

The security agreement has sparked concern among regional leaders.Mahuta said the Pacific Island Forum was the best platform for discussing regional security concerns.""I have concerns that based on a number of representations to ensure that this is fully discussed because of the regional implications that this has not been given priority, certainly by Solomon Islands, they have given us assurances, we must take them at their word, respecting their sovereignty,"" Mahuta said.""However, regional security issues, regional sovereignty issues are a matter of a broader forum.

New Zealand and Australia have reacted with frustration to the news Solomon Islands politicians have signed a security agreement with China.The possibility such a deal could be struck had prompted concerns - shared by the United States, that it could provide for China to establish a military base in the Pacific.A draft of the deal's text was leaked last month, but the final version that was agreed has not been released, even to the Solomon Island parliament. However it is believed to allow for Chinese forces to help maintain social order in the nation.China's foreign affairs ministry said Beijing will now cooperate with Honiara on maintaining social order, protecting people's safety, aid, combating natural disasters and helping safeguard national security.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the arrangement was signed before it could be discussed by Pacific nations, who are all impacted.China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific is sure to feature in conversation between Ardern and her Japanese counterpart today. The PM arrived in Tokyo overnight, kicking off the second leg of her international trade mission.Mahuta said she was saddened the Solomon Islands chose to pursue a security agreement outside the region.New Zealand has called for the issue to be a top priority for discussion at the next meeting of the 16-nation Pacific Islands Forum, which is scheduled for June. ""And I understand a number of other countries have called for that,"" Mahuta told Morning Report.""That's the challenge ... bringing this issue into the regional conversation ... around these terms and conditions between China and Solomon Islands.""""Nobody's seen the exact terms and conditions of the agreement, not the whole of the parliament of the Solomons, certainly not the Solomon Island peoples, and not the Pacific Island nations.The signing of the pact and so-far non-disclosure of its terms is part of a political dispute within the Solomon Islands, but its significance is much wider for the Pacific, Mahuta said.""I have concerns ... to ensure that this is fully discussed because of the regional implications - that this has not been given priority, certainly by the Solomon Islands. They have given assurances [about the content], we have to take them at their word, respecting their sovereignty.""However, regional security issues are a matter for a broader forum. We see the Pacific Islands Forum as the best place to bring those issues together so that we can get greater transparency and discuss these.""New Zealand had not yet formally requested the content of the agreement from either China or the Solomon Islands, but: ""There has been high level engagement at an officials level, and certainly between ambassadors both in China and in Honiara"", Mahuta said.""The whole of the Pacific want to discuss this issue because no-one's got a lot of visibility on the terms and conditions of the arrangement.""It's going to be a matter of trying to bring the Solomons into a conversation, rather than the Solomons feeling like they're defending their sovereignty and their being outcast by the rest of the Pacific.""

Australian leader of the opposition Penny Wong has accused the Australian government of dropping the ball on their interactions with Solomon Islands before the deal was signed, and allowing what she called the country's biggest foreign affairs failure in 80 years.Does Mahuta admit to any failure by New Zealand in not succeeding in persuading the Solomon Islands not to go ahead with the deal?""No,"" Mahuta said: ""New Zealand's upheld it's part of an agreement for the region.""That agreement is The Biketawa Declaration, which was set up by Pacific Islands Forum countries in 2000, and outlines how the parties to it will respond to a regional crisis.It has previously been invoked to assist Solomon Islands with unrest inside the country, with New Zealand among nations who sent assistance in response to riots and buildings burned in Honiara late last year, as well as an operation that wound up in 2017. It was also invoked in response to the Tonga eruption earlier this year.""We are the closest neighbours, we can respond,"" Mahuta said.Both China and Solomon Islands have dismissed fears a Chinese military base could be established in the Solomon Islands. But if this did happen, or if Chinese military personnel had a presence in the Solomon Islands, would that constitute a ""diplomatic red line"" for New Zealand?""Both China and the Solomons have been at pains on this recent signing to say that that is not the case,"" Mahuta said.""New Zealand by extension has said well, then we need to discuss these issues as a part of the Pacific Islands Forum, so all Pacific nations have the ability to hold those statements to account, but also to investigate the terms and conditions of the arrangement.""National said the government must ask itself why Solomon Islands looked past its traditional allies to China for a security deal.The party's foreign affairs spokesperson Gerry Brownlee said the development was a diplomatic failing.New Zealand should now consider extending its existing peacekeeping deployment in Solomon Islands, given growing volatility in the region, he said.Honiara-based freelance journalist Gina Kekea told Morning Report there had been dissatisfaction in Solomon Islands around the deal, particularly the lack of transparency about what has been signed.""Not much"" is known about what's in it: ""The framework of the agreement was based on the National Security Strategy which the government completed in 2020... and the leaked document that was shared by social media recently.""It's something which is a worry... the process has to be as transparent as possible, so everyone will understand.""Sogavare has indicated the Solomon Islands will have to follow certain processes as a result of the agreement, and the country's permanent secretary of foreign affairs has told a press conference the document will be made available, Kekea said.He had defended the deal as being in the best interests of the Solomon Islands and its people for keeping peace, said they had entered into the deal ""eyes wide open"", and that as a sovereign nation the country can make agreements with any country they see fit.",21 Apr 2022

The controversial deal has been the subject of significant debate in recent weeks, amid fears it could allow China to establish a military presence in the South Pacific.Labor has called the handling of the issue the greatest Australian foreign policy blunder in the Pacific since World War II.It questioned why the government sent Minister for the Pacific Zed Seselja instead of Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne to Honiara after a draft of the pact leaked.Senator Seselja was sent to Solomon Islands last week in a last-ditch effort to convince the government in Honiara to walk away from the deal, a trip now shown to have been fruitless.Shadow foreign affairs minister Penny Wong said Morrison had ignored warnings about the deal last year, and should have personally intervened to ensure it was never signed.""Securing our region at this time is such an imperative for any government that this should have been something that Mr Morrison dealt with - but he went missing,"" Wong said.""I think what this still signifies is that Australia is no longer, for … Solomon Islands, the nation to whom they turn to meet their challenges in every instance.""And, instead of taking responsibility and dealing with this as a leader should, in the interests of the nation, he sends a junior woodchuck at the last minute.""But Morrison told reporters in Adelaide he made a deliberate decision to send Senator Seselja because it would be counter-productive to publicly heap pressure on Solomon Islands over the agreement.""The foreign minister is a different level to the minister of Pacific. One is in cabinet, one is not. You calibrate your diplomacy to deal with sensitive issues,"" he said.""In the Pacific, one of the things you [have] got to be very, very cognisant of is there is a long history of frankly countries like Australia and even New Zealand and others coming around and treating Pacific Islands like they should be doing what the big countries tell them to do.""I'm not going to act like former administrations that treated the Pacific like some extension of Australia. The Pacific Islands are very sensitive to that and I have always had an approach with the Pacific Islands which understands those sensitivities because there is a lot at stake.""The prime minister also said the whole region had been facing ""intense"" approaches from China, and said Beijing made ""all sorts of promises"" and ""all sorts of investments"" in the Pacific which could be ""very persuasive"".""That is the challenge that we're now dealing with and we have been dealing with it for many years. It is not a new issue and these threats still remain"" he said.""I speak to other Pacific leaders about it all the time and ... you can't always be fully persuasive on these issues.""What I assure them about is that Australia will be there for you as we always are, not because we want anything from you, but because we see the Pacific as our family.""Australia, New Zealand and the United States have all expressed concern about the precedent the situation could set for other small Pacific nations.Australia's spy chiefs were also sent to Honiara to ventilate Australia's concerns about the pact.

Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare took to the floor of parliament this morning to defend the pact, declaring that his government went into the agreement with its ""eyes wide open"".Sogavare also suggested the agreement would help bolster the police force in Solomon Islands, which has already received riot gear and replica guns from Chinese police.""We intend to beef up and strengthen our police capability to deal with any future instability by properly equipping the police to take full responsibility of the country's security responsibilities, in the hope we will never be required to invoke any of our bilateral security arrangements,"" he said.When asked if he'd be willing to release the full text of the agreement he gave an ambiguous response, saying it was the ""way to go"" but also saying he had to consult with China before making a decision.Beijing typically does not release the text of its bilateral security agreements with other countries.In a statement, Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the US National Security Council, said the US convened a meeting with senior officials from Australia, Japan and New Zealand.""The officials reaffirmed the four countries' enduring and shared commitment to the Pacific Islands,"" she said.""The United States resolved to intensify its engagement in the region to meet 21st-century challenges.""Officials from the four countries represented also shared concerns about a proposed security framework between the Solomon Islands and the People's Republic of China and its serious risks to a free and open Indo-Pacific.""Foreign affairs minister Payne rejected Wong's assessment that inaction by the Morrison government had fuelled the situation.""I think that's an unfair characterisation, and I don't think it recognises the sovereign decisions that governments, of course, make for themselves,"" she said.""We are looking at very serious geo-strategic challenges in our region, and they are realities.""Payne insisted Australia still played a significant role in the South Pacific.""We firmly believe that the Pacific family is best placed to meet the security needs of our region - and we've consistently said that and, more importantly, we've consistently demonstrated that,"" she said.However, she argued, the governments in Honiara and Beijing needed to provide more detail about exactly what the security deal would allow for.""In relation to this agreement, we see a lack of transparency"" she said.""This has not been agreed in an open and transparent way, not been consulted, for example, across the region.""Top US official Kurt Campbell is slated to visit Solomon Islands later this week, as the United States warned of the ""concerning precedent"" the security deal set.Payne said she was pleased the trip was going ahead, but avoided speculation about whether the deal could be undone.""That's a matter for the parties,"" she said.-ABC",20 Apr 2022

In parliament on Wednesday, Manasseh Sogavare confirmed the controversial security agreement with China had been signed despite strong opposition to the deal from the other side of the house.The pact, a draft of which was first leaked online last month, raised domestic and regional anxieties about Beijing's increasing influence in the South Pacific.It's feared it could open the door to China's military presence in Honiara - a claim rejected both by China and Solomon Islands.Sogavare has defended the intention behind the move, saying its aim is for the nation to diversify its security ties ""to improve the quality of lives"" of its people and to ""address soft and hard security threats facing the country.""""I ask all our neighbours, friends and partners to respect the sovereign interests of Solomon Islands on the assurance that the decision will not adversely impact or undermine the peace and harmony of our region,"" Sogavare said.In response opposition leader Matthew Wale called on Sogavare to make the signed document public ""to allay any regional fears of any hidden parts of it"".""And now that the agreement has been signed whether the Prime Minister will allow a disclosure of the agreement so that members may have a perusal of it,"" Wale said.

Discussions on the early dissolution of Parliament dominated Caucus meetings this week.A formal statement outlining a range of pre-election activities, including when Parliament would be dissolved and when voter registration would begin is expected later this week after Caucus has finalised the details.One hurdle being faced by the government in holding an early election is funding.There are no provisions in the 2022 Appropriation Bill for the General Election next year.Only US$2.1 million is said to have been set aside for provincial elections in Choiseul and Western Provinces and a by-election for the West Kwaio constituency.To hold an election costs in the vicinity of $18 million - a budget usually shared by the national government and donors. Of this amount, the national government is required to pick up $11 million while donors pick up the balance, according to those familiar with election funding costs.Voter registration alone, which must start in July/August this year, costs around $6 million.""The problem for the government is, there is nothing in terms of funding in the budget for an early election.""I think all along the government thought it already had the extension of the four-year term to a five-year term in the bag. Now it is being caught in its own game,"" one source told the Star.""Financially, it is an impossible choice if they choose to go that direction. On the other hand it will not require any constitutional amendment and people will be happy about it.""In its fight to extend the life of Parliament by another 12 months, the government argued that the timing would be too close to the 2023 Pacific Games, which Solomon Islands is hosting.Those who argued against the extension said the proximity of the two events - the 2023 Pacific Games and the General Election, which by law is also due next year, is the reason for an early dissolution of Parliament so that a new government would oversee the completion of the Games itself.Some 359, 690 people registered to vote in the last election, held in April 2019 - an increase of 72, 123 voters over the 2014 election.",6 Apr 2022

Officials also posted a picture of Sogavare standing with Paul Symon, who is the head of the overseas spy agency the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS), and the Director-General of the Office of National Intelligence Andrew Shearer.A spokesman for Morrison declined to comment on the visit.The statement said the meeting provided a platform for the two countries to better understand each other, in particular on Solomon Islands' decision to its broadened security partnership with China.But there was no indication in the statement that Sogavare's government is willing to soften its position or abandon the deeply contentious agreement.The statement pointedly said that China remains an ""important trading partner for both countries and makes it clear that the government is not prepared to abandon efforts to strike security pacts with more countries.The ABC reports several Australian government ministers have publicly raised concerns about the pact since it was leaked online last month.It has since been ""initialled"" by top officials from China and Solomon Islands, but not yet signed and formalised by their foreign ministers.Last month, Morrison said the agreement showed the ""constant pressure"" being placed on Pacific states, and earlier this week a top US admiral labelled the security negotiations between Honiara and Beijing ""very concerning"".Sogavare lashed out at critics of the pact in parliament last week, insisting there was no prospect of a Chinese military base in Solomon Islands, and saying it was ""insulting"" to suggest his country couldn't navigate its relationship with Beijing.China's government has also berated Australia for publicly criticising the deal, accusing it of paranoia and trying to undermine the sovereignty of Solomon Islands.Some Pacific Island nations are uneasy about the agreement and the prospect of China striking its first bilateral security deal in the region, although few Pacific leaders have waded into the public furore.Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea James Marape told ABC earlier this week that other states in the region were ""conscious"" of events in Solomon Islands and wanted to discuss the matter at the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting this year.Samoa's Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mataʻafa also did not criticise the security pact but said Pacific Island countries had to hammer out a collective response to growing geopolitical competition in the region.",7 Apr 2022

New Zealand and Australia have expressed concern over a new security deal between China and Solomon Islands. The Detail takes a closer look at whether that concern is warranted, or whether it's geopolitical business as usual.When a draft security agreement between China and Solomon Islands was leaked late last month, New Zealand's top foreign affairs brass were quick to spring into action. The agreement would allow China to send police and military personnel to the Solomons ""to assist in maintaining social order"". Chinese warships could also use the Islands as a stopover point, or to replenish supplies, despite no port existing in the Solomons which could accommodate Chinese ships. New Zealand's Defence Minister Peeni Henare said the agreement took New Zealand intelligence by surprise. Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said it would be ""very concerning"" if the agreement was genuine (it's since been confirmed as authentic by Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasi Sogovare). Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described the prospective deal as ""gravely concerning"". But why is New Zealand's rhetoric so strong over what is essentially a sovereign nation exercising its own independent foreign policy? Victoria University of Wellington senior lecturer in political science and international relations Iati Iati says it's geopolitical business as usual. ""I think one of the problems from New Zealand and Australia's end is, they've always viewed this region through a strategic lens.  ""Whenever you put 'China', 'military' and 'the Pacific' into a sentence, you get everybody freaking out. But I think they probably want to just calm down a bit, see how this plays out. It's nothing to be too worried about right now, it's just normal relations."" Iati says New Zealand and Australia have, for most of the 20th century, considered the Pacific to be part of their neighbourhood: Australia is historically the biggest provider of aid to Pacific nations, and New Zealand maintains strong diplomatic and cultural ties with many of the countries in the Pacific. But as the world becomes more globalised and other actors on the world stage look to get involved, Iati says the Antipodean countries fear their influence could be on the wane.  China has invested heavily in Pacific countries over the past decade, he says, often without the strings attached to aid that New Zealand and Australia insist upon.  Since they gained independence, Iati says Pacific countries are prioritising development and asserting their own autonomy on the world stage. Cutting their own deals with big powers like China is part of that process.  And this willingness to open their ears to other countries may be symptomatic of an overly paternalistic relationship with New Zealand and Australia, Iati says, which can sometimes veer into the patronising.  When asked whether he might be over-intellectualising and ignoring more unsavoury aspects of the Chinese Communist Party's rule, like repression of freedom of speech and China's treatment of ethnic minorities, Iati says this is a fair point, but is perhaps blinkered to the acute needs of Pacific nations. ""These countries have a whole host of issues they have to deal with, from climate change to governance to accountability to poverty. I think it's a bit unfair to heap all these other issues on them to consider in establishing their diplomatic relations when even countries like Australia and New Zealand are happy to do business with a lot of these big powers that may do things that we don't agree with in other parts of the world."" Follow The Detail on Apple Podcasts , Spotify, Stitcher, iHeart, Google Podcasts or wherever you listen to your podcasts. You can also stay up-to-date by liking us on Facebook or following us on Twitter.

Panuelo is the first Pacific Island Forum leader to publicly call on Sogavare to reject the security treaty with Beijing citing ""grave security concerns"".According to the FSM national government ""such a novel and unprecedented security agreement"" between the two countries ""poses a risk of increasing geopolitical tensions"" across the region.Although the security arrangement was strictly a matter between Honiara and Beijing, it will affect all Pacific nations, said Panuelo.He said the Federated States of Micronesia can't ""endorse or agree"" with Solomon Islands if it proceeds with a security relationship with China ""because of its far-reaching and grave security implications for a harmonious and peaceful"" Pacific region.RNZ Pacific's correspondent in Majuro, Giff Johnson, said Panuelo is speaking from a unique platform given Micronesia's bilateral relations with both the US and China.""Which is that it has a compact of free association with the United States and also many decades long diplomatic ties with China. This is unique in the region because the other two compact states both have ties with Taiwan,"" he said.Meanwhile, a Pacific political expert says concerns about China's influence in the Pacific is unjustified.University of Hawaii's director of Pacific Islands Studies, Tarcisius Kabuataulaka, says Beijing won't establish a naval base in the Solomons anytime soon.""Beijing limits its international military presence. The only military base that China has outside of China is in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa, and therefore China, if it can internationalise its security apparatus from China, then it does not necessarily need to have military bases.""",1 Apr 2022

Seymour plays Ruby, a woman with dementia, sharing a room with her granddaughter, who is less than keen about the arrangement. However, the more time they spend together and the more family secrets emerge, the more the teenage appreciates her grandmother.Having been around a lot of people who have had Alzheimer's throughout her life, not to mention producing the movie about musician Glen Campbell's struggle with the disease, the 71-year-old actress felt instantly drawn to the role.Seymour, who is a global ambassador for the Dementia Foundation for Spark of Life, joins Sunday Morning to discuss Ruby's Choice, how she got inside the head of the character, and why she continues to keep looking forward and living her life in the present moment.""I'm very proud of this film,"" Seymour says.""It's very much sort of the little engine that could. The fact that we were able to film it during Covid was unbelievable.""""Having been around a lot of people with Alzheimer's, having had it touch my life ...

A draft security cooperation agreement was leaked on Friday and it could allow China to deploy police and military personnel in Solomon Islands.The document lays down a framework which could permit Beijing to deploy forces to protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands.Speaking to the parliament yesterday, Sogavare was critical of media reporting around the leak.But in responding to a question about how far along negotiations on the treaty were, Sogavare, said the document was already finalised.""Mr Speaker I was just replying to the leader of opposition who has asked how far have we got in terms of finalising these things. We have already finalised it. The document is ready for signing.

That is why I am announcing this referendum to be carried out as soon as possible,"" he said.Earlier this week Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare defeated a motion of no confidence in him by 32 votes to 15 with two abstentions.It was moved by the leader of the opposition Matthew Wale after major political unrest in the capital last month saw three days of rioting, looting and burning of businesses and properties in Honiara.Sogavare said he would defend the principles of democracy and the rule of law no matter the cost.In his first public statement since the vote, Sogavare said the Solomon Islands is a democratic country with a democratically-elected government and he did not resign because that would only bring the wrong message to future generations.The government is also being criticised for only passing one new law this year.Opposition MP and member for East 'Are'Are Peter Kenilorea Jr said the only law the government has passed in parliament this year is an amendment to the Telecommunications Act.He said the government cannot use the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse for not doing its job.""Just this year Fiji passed 34 Acts. They had community transmission. They worked. Papua New Guinea had 15, and 43 last year. We cannot just leave our jobs just because of Covid-19. We don't even have community transmission.""",8 Dec 2021

About 250 defence force and police personnel from Australia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and New Zealand are on high alert in anticipation of potential unrest around the outcome of the vote.Local media reported that numerous local families departed from Honiara aboard interisland ferries to return to home villages to avoid potential unrest in the capital, where many shops and schools have also closed.The motion was tabled by the Opposition leader, Matthew Wale, who has accused Sogavare of allowing corruption to fester, and of treating the people of Malaita province with contempt.Malaitans played a central role in the late November protest that sparked the unrest, which left extensive destruction in Honiara, prompting Sogavare's request for regional security help.Malaita's provincial premier Daniel Suidani, whose administration has fallen out with the national government, especially over the country's move to switch diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China, has denied claims by the coalition that he instigated the unrest.Wale told parliament that the actions of the rioters should not obscure the real issue behind the unrest.""We must condemn all the criminality in the strongest terms, but it pales, Mr Speaker, in comparison to the looting happening at the top,"" he said.Speaking in favour of the motion, former prime minister Rick Hounipwela described Sogavare as the ultimate opportunist whose accession to prime minister over four stints ""has always been under abnormal circumstances"".Blaming the prime minister for negligent management of the country's finances, Hounipwela said the country's corruption problem had deepened under Sogavare's rule.""We've experienced huge tax exemptions worth millions of dollars given to the people who least needed it, usually the loggers and mining operators.""

In today's debate on the motion, Sogavare said the motion had been filed against the backdrop of an illegal attempted coup.""When we are under attack from forces of evil, we must stand up for what is right, we must stand up to this tyranny. We cannot entertain violence being used to tear down a democratically elected government.""Sogavare rejected the opposition's accusation of corruption against him.Hounipwela, the MP for Small Malaita, accused the prime minister of using the pandemic State of Emergency to give himself authoritarian powers.He also claimed Sogavare has used police to repress public criticism of his leadership, and of directing foreign embassies and high commissions in the country to notify the government of their moves around the provinces.""To vote against [the motion], members would be aiding and abetting his zeal for power and to rule this country with an iron fist. That's what we see as a track record.""Seating arrangements in parliament today suggest Sogavare will win the confidence vote.",6 Dec 2021

New Zealand has sent police and military personnel to the Solomon Islands in a response to a government request last week for aid. The aim is to help calm riots which have led to the destruction of property and businesses, and at least three deaths. Much has been made in news reports about the role of China and Taiwan in this unrest. But it’s much more complicated than that.Today on The Detail, Emile Donovan talks to RNZ Pacific’s Koroi Hawkins, who grew up in Solomon Islands, to discuss the background to the protests which descended to riots; the deep-seated issues of governance and imperfect democracy; and what it’s like watching a conflict like this unfold in your homeland from thousands of kilometres away.   Solomon Islands were first settled by humans tens of thousands of years ago. The first contact from Europeans was in the mid-16th century, and they were made a British protectorate in 1893.The islands were a key battleground during World War II: following the attack on Pearl Harbour, Japan and America vied for control as a strategic stronghold in the Pacific. To this day, the waters around some of the main islands are popular destinations for divers, due to the many discarded vehicles on the sea floor. While the islands were never colonised in the way New Zealand was, British influence continued even after the Solomons gained its independence in 1978.

A Westminster model of government was established, but little in the way of supporting structures put in place, and RNZ Pacific’s Koroi Hawkins says this has led to issues in adjusting to a very foreign style of governance. “When I came here to New Zealand, you have all these little councils, committees, all through society, at church level, community level. In Solomon Islands there’s none of that lower-level evidence of the democratic system,” he says. “It’s all chief councils, what the chief says goes … the provincial government is kind of structured in the Westminster way, but they’re not properly resourced so they’re not able to function effectively.“And then you hit the national government, and all of a sudden it’s a full Westminster westernised system of parliament. “There’s almost a corruption of the system itself: the way MPs are elected and seen in Solomon Islands is based on what they can do directly, with money, with development, for their constituencies. They’re not elected on their policies or their legislation. People are very much voting for MPs as ‘big men’ still.” Riots are not new in Solomon Islands: in the late 1990s, political dissatisfaction descended into violence, largely between locals from Guadalcanal – the wealthiest of the islands where the Solomons’ capital is located –  and people from Malaita, the most populous island, spurred by waves of Malaitan migration which caused the capital to swell in size. Unrest was only subdued when a regional assistance mission, led by Australia and involving New Zealand and other Pacific nations, came in in 2003 to help boost the economy and train up the police force. The RAMSI mission, as it became known, only left the Solomons in 2017. Hawkins says the pandemic has accentuated existing economic and political inequalities, with the government giving itself considerable executive powers which many in the Solomons feel oversteps the mark. He says while a diplomatic switch in allegiance from Taiwan to China has been held up as a big factor by international media, it’s not the main concern of protestors, who want to see more transparency and accountability from their elected officials.

Three people died and close to 100 businesses were destroyed during three days of political unrest in the city.The damage has been estimated at more than $US60 million ($SBD500m) and climbing with over 1000 workers out of a job, the Solomons Central Bank announced last week.The Red Cross Society has completed assessments in areas worst-hit by the unrest, with over 250 households registered.The society's Secretary-General in the Solomons, Clement Manuri, told RNZ Pacific they will be distributing emergency supplies to the first 20 families today.While he admits the assistance has come three weeks late, Manuri said they are only giving out non-food and hygiene items.""The team will start distributing non-food items to the local employees so it's mainly hygiene kits for now.""And there are families who will receive emergency shelter tool kits as well.""The National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) is handling requests from families for food supplies, Manuri said.

Life is beginning to slowly return to normal in the capital, but there's still an air of uncertainty about, Manuri said.He said reports of a group threatening an armed attack on the capital 'has put everyone on edge.'""Shops are opening and every other offices. But again with police now arresting people for questioning, tension is still high.""It's still not really back to normal with the questioning of people they think might have contributed to what had happened in last month's riots.""Police say they are investigating the threats of an armed attack.Commissioner Mostyn Mangau said the threat is being treated as a matter of national security.""Police will not tolerate any armed groups or criminals who are taking the opportunity to plan their crimes to threaten the sovereignty of this nation.""Meanwhile, the presence of hundreds of regional security personnel from Australia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and New Zealand is still being felt on Honiara's streets.The group is there to provide peacekeeping support to the local authorities, Mangau said.

Among those affected in last month's riots were the Chinese community, whose businesses in Chinatown were torched and looted.Manuri said many of these Chinese shopowners are hesitant to come forward and speak with the Red Cross volunteers.He was asked is it the fear of further repercussions?""I'm not sure but their businesses were targeted during the unrest,"" Manuri said. ""It could be also that they don't need anything from us but are awaiting the government's support package for businesses.""The Chinese community was targeted partly due to the Solomons government's switch of diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China in 2019, a move that has angered some communities in the aid-dependent nation.Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare last week survived a vote of no-confidence in Parliament.Manuri said they will continue to reach out to the Chinese community in Honiara.""That is still a challenge. Not everyone is coming forward. Not like the locals, some of them turned up even today at our office. But it's not what the Chinese business owners are doing.""We will still do our best to get all the business owners that we are yet to assess or register.""The Solomon Islands Chinese Association (SICA) said in a statement that it has more than 70 years of history in the islands.""Many Chinese individuals and families have lost literally everything and are also homeless,"" it said, condemning the ""senseless"" violence.

Meanwhile, initial assessments conducted on the burnt buildings from the unrest have found moderate to high health risks.In a statement, the Solomons Health Ministry said the toxic gases are a result of burnt products such as paints, chemicals and pesticides, physical structures and vapour including refrigerators (freezers, fridges, air-conditions etc).""The impacts of smoke from burning trash and plastic burning trash cans can cause long-term health problems.""These smokes contain vapours and particulate matter, solid and liquid droplets that are suspended in the air and harmful to humans when inhaled or in contact with the eyes, skin and ears,"" the statement said.The National Disaster Council has established that parts of Chinatown a 'No Go Zone'.This includes areas in and around groups of burnt buildings on the nearby Ranadi suburb.The public is also advised to keep away from burnt buildings along Kukum and Lungga areas.""All shops in close proximity or near to burnt down buildings are advised to close for now until further advice is issued,"" the health ministry said.Led by the National Disaster Council (NDC) through the National Disaster Operation Centre (N-DOC), the assessments were conducted by the police, Fire and Rescue Services, the Honiara City Council, Health Ministry, the Environmental Health Division, Ministry of Infrastructure and Development (MID).

The New Zealand police will be in the country for up to four weeks, following a request by the Solomons government for regional security help.Their work will be in support or local police and Australian Federal Police with community reassurance and engagement in Honiara following major rioting and looting fanned by protests calling for the removal of Prime Minister Manaseeh Sogavare.A week on, the local community is still taking stock of three days of rioting by mobs who torched buildings and looted shops, decimating the Chinatown district and the eastern side of the city.Yesterday, 15 New Zealand Defence Force personnel flew to the Solomons, with about three dozen more going this weekend.About 200 soldiers and police personnel from Australia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji already deployed to Honiara since last week's devastating rioting.Regional governments who have sent security forces to Honiara have indicated they don't expect the mission to be more than a month.While grateful for the regional security help, Solomon Islands govenment MPs are wary of the potential for protestors to stir unrest again, pending the outcome of the impending confidence vote that Sogavare is facing in parliament.""My fear is the public opinion after what will be transpired after the (confidence) motion on Monday, I don't know what the public reaction will be,"" Makira MP William Marau said.""So what will happen after Monday will determine how long the troops will remain in Solomon Islands.""

The Central Bank of Solomon Islands is forecasting a contraction of 0.6 percent in the country's economy as a result of the November riots.The bank said the extent of the damage is worse than its initial assesments and the cost is now estimated at $US66-million, more than double the initial estimate of $US28-million.Prior to the destruction in the capital, which saw 63 buildings burnt and looted, the country's economy was forecast to grow by 0.4 percent this year.Worst hit has been the retail and wholesale sector, which accounted for more than 50 percent of the damage, with $US28-million worth of goods destroyed, further exacerbating an already disrupted supply chain amid the pandemic.

The bank also expects approximately 1000 people have lost or will be about to lose their jobs as a result of the unrest.Not yet quantified are the spill-over effects of the riot into other sectors of the economy such as utilities, communication, transport, education, police and other services.It says the government is expected to lose around 31 percent of its monthly revenue or a net loss of around $US10-million over the next three months.Higher imports and outward remittances in the coming months are expected with overall imports estimated to increase by $US3.2-million to $US40-million leading to the current account deficit widening by 3 percent of GDP by the end of 2021.CBSI earlier forecasted inflation to increase by 3 percent by year-end on the back of high fuel and food prices. The riot-induced impacts will result in inflation rising even further to 3.7 percent at end 2021 as unexpected food and tobacco shortages as well as demand and supply mismatches add to the already elevated price pressures.Non-Performing-Loans are also expected to rise as a number of businesses affected acquired loans totalling $US5.3 million.Governor of the Central Bank, Dr Luke Forau, added that the riot further deepened the already weak and sluggish economy. The trajectory the country is moving on has been likened to 'development in reverse'.

Aid agencies are preparing for food shortages in the Pacific island nation's devastated capital Honiara.The crisis erupted last week with three days of rioting, blamed partly on poverty, hunger and frustration with government policies.There are 700,000 people in the Solomons, with about 75,000 in Honiara.The conflict claimed at least three lives as crowds tried to torch the prime minister's private residence before being dispersed by police.Chamber chair Ricky Fuo'o said food supplies were becoming scarce.""Rice is the main staple food especially in Honiara City. Most of the Chinese shops and the wholesalers were looted and burned.""There isn't a lot of food to go around so I fear for the worst. The worst is yet to come especially with food shortages.""Papua New Guinea, Fiji, and Australia have deployed security personnel to assist the local authorities.Fuo'o said while security was key to restoring peace following last week's political unrest, the government must also address the humanitarian crisis.Rioters burned and looted businesses during the three-day conflict and this meant many of them were closed, he said.

Over three days last week, many buildings were torched in Honiara's east, particularly its Chinatown area - leaving at least three people dead.The unrest had spiralled from a protest against Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare last Wednesday.By the weekend, law and order was largely restored in Honiara due to the reinforcement of local police capabilities due to the peacekeepers from Australia and Papua New Guinea.Yesterday, the Solomons parliament met briefly - amid tight security - to pass two motions. One was for the routine extension of the State of Public Emergency in place since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.The other is to authorise expenditure for the massive loss and damage caused by the riots - estimated at US$28-million.Despite the resignation of four government MPs last week, and calls for him to stand down to restore control in the country, Sogavare still commands a clear majority in the house.

The MP for Central Guadalcanal, Peter Shanel Agovaka, who is also Communications and Aviation Minister, said each time a group of people from outer provinces or was unhappy with the government, they tended to come to Honiara and destroy local business houses.""I think people from other provinces should respect that as hosts of this capital we allow people of all provinces, and all denominations and all races, to come here.""This is the melting pot of the country, and to see it in ruins like this is really very sad.""According to Shanel, a lot of households have been affected.""Eighty to ninety percent of Chinatown is burnt down. This is really sad, because these are innocent people.""The way to remove a prime minister is through the parliamentary process. It's not through the burning of businesses or private properties and looting them,"" he said.All schools in the Solomon Islands capital have been ordered to close early as a result of the widespread destruction caused by last week's unrest in Honiara.The permanent secretary of the Ministry of Education, Franco Rodie, says the decision was reached after consultation with the heads of various schools and taking into consideration parents concerns for the safety of their children.Dr Rodie said thankfully most major exit examinations had already been conducted and in class assessments will have to be taken into consideration for everyone else.Forty-one out of 49 members of parliament present yesterday voted in favour of the four-month-extension, as proclaimed by the governer general Sir David Vunagi.The opposition leader Matthew Wale asked for clarification on the Covid status of emergency personnel from Australia and Papua New Guinea brought in because of last week's riots.The health Minister Culwick Togamana said all foreign security personnel are double vaxxed and tested negative for Covid-19 upon departure and again on arrival in the country.Togamana also expressed disappointment in the poor uptake of vaccines with less than 20 percent of the population fully vaccinated.

The violence, of course I don't condone it. But at the same time, leaders have decisions to make,"" he said.The prime minister has said that he was elected on the floor of parliamant and can only be removed on the floor of parliament.But Wale said that the country's democratic processes were paralysed by the control of numbers in parliament.He said the Sogavare government's move to switch diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China in 2019 has played a part.""Sogavare controls those numbers because he attracts a lot of funding from loggers and - now it's very clear - from China. So China is interferring in our domestic politics. It's very, very clear.""According to Wale, people are angry because the country's system of government has become capitive to vested interests of logging and mining companies, as well as China.""And so the interests of the people are sidelined or totally ignored and neglected, and that's why they feel they have to take it up themselves.""It's a really tragic situation, it's an unfortunate situation that people lose trust in the democratic processes.""Wale said the national government's persistent persecution of Malaita province has brought things to a head.New Zealand response New Zealand's acting Foreign Minister, David Parker, said Aotearoa New Zealand is deeply concerned at the events unfolding in Solomon Islands.He said New Zealand is a long-standing partner of the Solomons, and there are deep and enduring connections between the two countries.Mr Parker said New Zealand's engagement in the Solomons is guided by the principle of tātou tātou - everyone acting together for the common good.He said New Zealand stands with the government and people of Solomon Islands.Mr Parker said New Zealand will remain in close contact with its Solomons counterparts and international partners, though there has not yet been a request for assistance.New Zealand Police are currently providing advice and support to their counterparts in the Solomons.The High Commission in Honiara is providing SafeTravel advice to New Zealanders in the country.Only six buildings still standing in Honiara's ChinatownRNZ Pacific correspondent in Honiara, Georgina Kekea, said there are only six buildings still standing in Honiara's Chinatown after two days of rioting.

The Institute said Chinese aid, in the form of grants and low interest loans, peaked in 2016, at US$287 million.Lowy's Pacific programme director, Jonathan Pryke said by 2019 that aid was down to US$169 million - its lowest level in seven years.""Total aid in 2019 was about US$2.44 billion, so they [China] are by no means a bit player, but they were certainly not the dominant force that many people would believe, and yes the story is very much one of decline,"" he said.The institute also found that a greater proportion of that reduced aid is in the form of concessional loans rather than grants.Within this period two Pacific nations, Kiribati and Solomon Islands transferred their allegiance from Taiwan to China.In addition, both New Zealand and Australia launched Pacific re-set campaigns with the apparent aim of targeting the perceived rise in Chinese influence.There is no immediate explanation for the cutback.Pryke said it's not clear why, but maybe a sign the aid had served its purpose, because China still retains its influence.He said low cost lending, in particular, had been used as a vehicle to get Chinese business enterprises into the Pacific.""And these organisations have put down deep roots in the Pacific now and are no longer reliant on Chinese aid to engage in commercial activity, prosecute China's interests. You know, no one in the Pacific will tell that in 2020 or 2021 that China's presence felt less impactful or less significant, but it is just that aid was less of a driver for it than it has been in the past,"" he said.",5 Oct 2021

The total value of the fund is over $US 960,000, equivalent to $SBD 7.8 million.Opposition leader Matthew Wale said the name ""National Development Fund"" is misleading.""These funds are not for national development at all. The title of National Development Funds is to mock the people of this country, the funds are purely political, used by the Prime Minister to maintain his office.""Mr Wale also said that the fund had been previously financed by Taiwan and has now been taken over by China, after the Solomon Islands government's decision to end diplomatic relations with Taipei.""The fact that the funds are paid by a foreign power is an egregious breach of Solomon Islands sovereignty and undermines government's ability to maintain any semblance of independence in its foreign policy,"" Mr Wale said.

Mr Wale said he was disappointed with China, as he had raised his objections to the Fund with China's ambassador to the Solomon Islands last year, and had been assured it would be discontinued.""It is shameful. This Prime Minister has built his reputation as the champion of sovereignty when he fought hard to resist RAMSI (Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands) in its early days, but it seems he has no problem at all receiving direct foreign power funding to secure his political interests, without the slightest thought of the impact on the sovereignty he often pretends to protect,"" he said.In response to the accusations the Solomon Islands Government has issued a statement conceding that when the fund was started by the Republic of China or Taiwan it was a discretionary fund for the prime minister.""Previous Prime Ministers have exercised their discretion in allocating these funds. However, when the Republic of China gave these funds they did not require that these funds be used for development projects,"" the statement said.But it said under China's financial arrangements the National Development Fund is now a project based constituency fund which opposition MPs are also welcome to apply for.

It accused Mr Wale of feigning ignorance about these changes in order to create political instability.The government statement also condemned the opposition leader's singling out of China which it says is simply supporting development in the country.""The politicisation of the diplomatic switch to China overt and covert by some of our politicians is becoming childish and tedious. We should all be focusing on development and not on politicking,"" the statement said.Matthew Wale in turn has rubbished the government's response pointing out that the leaked list of recipients of the fund this year are all government MPs.Mr Wale challenged the prime minister to publish all of the recipients of the fund in 2019 and 2020 to prove the claim that it is not only government MPs who benefit from the 'shameful' fund.The Chinese Embassy in Honiara has so far not responded to the accusations of political interference.",8 Sep 2021

The relaxed restrictions for workers from the three countries in the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme are expected to be a boon for the tourism-reliant countries, which have had no visitors for the past 17 months.But the RSE scheme includes workers from nine Pacific countries, and Solomon Islands are now asking why their RSE workers weren't allowed the same relaxed quarantine rules as Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu.The chair of a seasonal work programme in Samoa said the New Zealand RSE scheme was well run and well respected in Samoa, and it was ""great news"" the two-week quarantine requirement had been dropped for their workers.Tuatagaloa Joe Annandale said the scheme was in heavy demand, given the impact of Covid-19 on the country's tourism sector, and Samoa was ready to go.""The government has a work- ready pool of about 3000 to 4000 people. Six thousand people graduate every year, from schools here and they need jobs.""With Covid and everything else that's been happening, there are just not the opportunities for them to work and right now, seasonal work is a great option.""Tuatagaloa said while Australia offered great pay and more jobs, remoteness and isolation were problems, and there was a quarantine requirement.New Zealand has yet to announce how many workers could come from each country. The previous allocation was for 14,400 workers in total, though employers have called for more.Tonga head of Internal Affairs Fotu Fisi'iahi also said his people were ready to go, but first there were 550 Tongan RSE workers still to be repatriated.""The news is good ... the issue here is that we have to bring back our RSE workers who are currently in New Zealand to the satisfaction of the New Zealand government before we start re-joining the scheme.""Those entering New Zealand on the RSE scheme still have to follow the quarantine rules for their own country when they return home.Dr Fisi'iahi said this was the biggest challenge for Tonga because it could only handle 250 people at a time. And it would take three months to bring the seasonal workers home.""There's a monthly turnaround: three weeks quarantine, one week for cleaning up and resting of the frontliners. Many people, especially on social media, they don't understand the challenges.""Meanwhile in Solomon Islands, the leader of the opposition Matthew Wale said he did not understand why his country was not included.""I wondered what criteria was used in selecting the countries that New Zealand has extended that privilege to, and whether it is any different for Solomon Islands.""Wale said his country also had no community transmission of Covid-19 and their border security had been tightened to no- exemption entry, including the once porous border with neighbouring Bougainville.He said 70 percent of the population was under 30 years old, and many were unemployed now because tourism, fishing and agriculture had all declined.""Have mercy, please include us. We are absolutely desperate and the New Zealand RSE programme is a life saver for the Solomon Islands.""I would ask that the Solomon Islands is included in the first cohort of countries. We're no different from Vanuatu and Tonga.""However, a Samoan community spokesperson Tupa'imatuna FotuoSamoa Jackson was worried Pacific workers were being exploited in the pandemic environment where they had few options and New Zealand was holding all the cards.""It's like the best of the worst options. It's like we are prepared to settle for this mediocre solution because of the desperation for work, and we just have to accept it in a way. But it doesn't take away the fact that it's a power imbalance and Pacific people have to do this to make ends meet.""Tupa'imatuna said it was worth noting that the quarantine-free scheme was announced a day after the apology for the Dawn Raids of the 1970s where Pacific workers were deported because they were no longer economically useful.",4 Aug 2021

About 100,000 doses sent through the COVAX programme facility need to be used within a month or they will go to waste.A little more than 41,000 people in PNG have now had the vaccine, mostly essential workers and about 7000 health workers. But the figures are a drop in the bucket compared to the total population of 9 million people.Professor Glen Mola, the head of obstetrics and gynaecology at Port Moresby General Hospital, said the government could be more vigourous in quelling misinformation from anti-vaxxers.""It's just ridiculous that we spend hundreds of hours out of our precious health worker time countering the ridiculous conspiracy theories of a few people. They spend all their days on social media spreading all this fear.""The Controller has powers under the National Pandemic Act, to declare people a threat to public safety... and give them a warning and lock them up if they don't heed the warning.""

Many of PNG's nurses initially refused to get the vaccine when first offered in late March and early April, asking for clear information about its safety and efficacy.A Port Moresby nurse (who asked not to be named) this week told RNZ her colleagues had been working their way through the information about the vaccine that had since been made available to them, but she was not yet convinced about it.""The front-liners are not well informed of all those things, so most of us are still in suspense. But we are just trying to read around and search online, and see for ourselves what it is.""Prof Mola said his team of doctors had all lined up for the jab, but more work was needed to be put into the campaign to vaccinate as many health workers as possible.""They've had their first shot, and some have had two shots now - that's the doctors in the maternity side. And we have not had a doctor go down with Covid since we started vaccinating.""One prominent anti-vaxxer in PNG with almost 7000 Facebook followers offers multiple daily commentaries on what she described as a global project to kill and maim millions.

The information shared included 'terrifying' reports from an alternative UK media source, denigration of organisations which support the vaccine rollout in PNG, and questions such as: ""How many times do we have to tell these idiots who have allowed themselves to be injected with poison?""Marape earlier warned citizens against relying on information on Facebook to guide their approach to vaccines.The official death toll from Covid-19 in PNG is 167, but as with the total confirmed cases, the real figure is likely to be much higher, as testing for the virus and reporting of deaths have been limited.Health workers feature prominently among those in PNG confirmed to have caught the virus so far, and systemic staffing shortages were placing great strain on the workers who continued on the job.The Port Moresby nurse spoken to by RNZ said she believed there were hospital staff infected with the virus who continued to work in the hospital.""Maybe they are just trying to normalise the coronavirus like any other diseases,"" she said.In the Solomon Islands, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare spoke out in a nationwide address criticising a small group of health workers who had promoted misinformation about Covid-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness.He said it was extremely sad that the group had ignored evidence that vaccines were vital to break the cycle of the pandemic, and instead promoted misleading information to the public.""While I respect individual points of view, I will not allow deliberate misinformation to scare people that wish to protect themselves from Covid-19.""If such deliberate misinformation continues, those involved will be held accountable in accordance with provisions of the relevant regulations.""Prof Mola said drily that the upshot was that PNG was relying on the natural protection in a youthful population to mitigate some of the impacts of Covid-19.""75 percent of our population are under 30. And by and large (among) under-30s only one out of 1000 gets seriously ill, and one out of 2000 dies. So we're going to rely on the protection of youth.""PNG Health Minister Jelta Wong said officials were doing what they could to vaccinate the priority groups, and while there were ongoing ""issues"" with reaching all healthworkers, the vaccinations were now been extended to the elderly.",18 Jun 2021

Police said the man, who lives at Gilbert Camp in the hills above the capital Honiara, had dug down several metres on Saturday, when he struck something metal.When he discovered it was a WWII shell, he called police and an explosive ordnance disposal team then removed 101 highly explosive shells from the site.They were 105mm shells of the kind widely used with light field howitzer artillery by US troops in the Pacific theatre.Last week, a 105mm WWII shell detonated under a cooking fire in Honiara, fatally wounding two men and injuring another two other people.

That tragedy sparked calls for the Solomon Islands government to put more effort into locating and disposing of dangerous World War II bombs and shells, which still present a danger.The Solomon Islands was the scene of fierce fighting between Japan and the United States in WWII, and critics say the government must put more pressure on those countries to play a bigger role in disposing of the dangerous ordnance left behind.The officer in charge, Inspector Clifford Tunuki said the police team took two days to remove the shells, on Saturday and Sunday, and also scanned the surrounding area for more unexploded ordnance (UXO).""Since the UXOs pose great risk, I ask our good people, especially those in Honiara and other province with high deposits of UXOs to report it to police or to have their properties cleared by a UXO clearance company if they intend to develop it,"" Tunuki said.",18 May 2021

Health teams are already in Western and Choiseul provinces preparing to deliver the vaccine to 17-thousand people considered most at risk from Covid-19 as they're closest to PNG which has a serious outbreak.A senior advisor to the Solomons health ministry, Dr Yogesh Choudhri, says people are being given extra information about the risks.""Overall the risk is extremely low. Our stance right now is to continue with the vaccination. If the WHO issues a statement it cannot be used in a certain age group then of course we have an issue because all of our frontliners would be young people... we (couldn't) immunise them with AstraZeneca so we would have to look for alternatives.""Dr Choudhri said countries which are now limiting the vaccine vary widely in their age cut offs for the vaccine, another reason for caution over limiting its use, he said.In Australia, the Pfizer vaccine is now the preferred option for people under 50 because of the potential risk from AstraZeneca for younger people.Britain is offering an alternative for those under 30 while France and Belgium recommend AstraZeneca be given to those 55 and over.Germany, Italy and Spain have have suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60.""The issue can be raised that we have a young population, so should we be doing it, but there has been no scientific consensus by the WHO, the EMA (European Medicines Agency) as to what is the cut off situation,"" Dr Choudhri said.Health authorities had vaccinated just over 3000 frontline and essential workers and other vulnerable people in the capital, Honiara, by Monday night.",14 Apr 2021

Photo: Supplied/ the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre
The province's Gizo Fish Market is normally restocked with fish daily as people from communities take turn to sell their fish.This usually makes it easy to control the price of fish at the market.But tuna vendors want the authorities to explain why they have to pay $US2.51 to sell their catch at the Gizo market while those selling reef fish are charged US62cents.Tuna vendors said they were concerned because they spend more money and risk their lives to travel out in the open waters to fish.This has raised a feud among the tuna fish sellers in recent times.Namu Avo is from the Babanga community, outside Gizo Island. She is a frequent vendor at the Gizo market and one of those who has questioned the fee differences.Avo said she felt disappointed with how the authorities were charging the fees for fish vendors at the market.She said the difference of $US1.88 was expensive for tuna vendors, who had put more effort, time and money to fish tuna.She said sometimes vendors returned with ""few tuna, maybe less than 20"", and they really needed to sell them out to repay the expenses incurred on the fishing trip.But they still charged the vendors the same amount of fee and this was unfair, Avo said.Avo and other tuna vendors at the Gizo market agreed the authorities needed to consider the challenges and expenses they endured to bring fresh tuna to the market.Avo said many of them had to wake as early as 2am to prepare before heading out to various fish-aggregating devices (FADs) to fish.

According to Pacnews, Wesley Misu a fisherman and vendor from the Titiana Community outside Gizo, said the trip to reach the FADs could take up to five hours.Travelling out into the open seas in search of various FAD devices is very difficult and dangerous, and expensive, Misu said.The weather, he said, could be unpredictable and fishers had to take extra precaution.Fishermen sometimes had to cancel their fishing trips when there was no fuel or when the weather was severe, Misu said.Avo also said that fishing was a challenge for tuna fishers as they were not certain their catch would be 'completely sold'.She said reef fish sellers only took advantage of the reefs and didn't spend much money to fish for tuna as they had exploited the nearby reefs.Avo said the Gizo Fish Market was supposed to make selling fair to all, so that communities near Gizo could sell their fish each day.Each market day allowed vendors from two communities, including Titiana, Nusa Baruku, Babanga, and Saeragi, she said.Avo said as a community, vendors had to take turns to sell their catch at the market.But she said many vendors at the Gizo market were not unsupportive of this arrangement.Avo said she had found out that fish vendors at the Noro market were charged $US62cents regardless of being a reef fish or a tuna vendor.However she said competition was not high at Noro Market as it was at Gizo.It was lessened because the National Fisheries Development unloaded most of its catch to the SolTuna cannery there, Avo said.She said at Babanga there were a lot of boats and that nearly all families on the island went out to fish, as it was their only means of survival.She said the competition at the Gizo market could get high when other fishers or vendors arrived with high fish quantity.And when they started dropping their prices, others had no option but to do the same, she said.Avo said there was no understanding between the tuna vendors at the market.She warned such situations would force fish prices to drop to as low as $US1.25 and this did not cover the expenses incurred to travel out to fish in the open seas.

According to Avo and Misu, this misunderstanding had forced many fishers to resort to fishing in the nearby reefs.Too much fish was being harvested, so that unsustainable overfishing was occurring in the reefs outside Gizo, Avo said.Misu said since there was no land available to do gardening, fishing was the villagers' source of income.He said the money earned from fishing was used to pay for food, children's school fees and other basic necessities.Misu said when they were not able to fish for tuna in the open seas, vendors had to revisit the local reefs to help sustain our families.Gizo Town Council clerk Charles Kelly told Pacnews the local council was not responsible for collecting fees from vendors at the market.Kelly said vendors needed to negotiate with the Gizo market master.But he said the council was alarmed at the level of overfishing outside Gizo.Gizo Market Master Moffat Maeta said his office was fully aware of the matter, and that his officers would try and sort out the situation so it was fair to all.Maeta said the fee collectors were often lenient with reef fish vendors, which resulted in the low fees charged instead of the unstable fees.He said normally, the fish market fees were charged at $US2.51 across the board for all vendors.This is clearly stated in the Western Provincial Government Market Ordinance, Maeta said.He said there were plans to review the market ordinance and the fish market fees.Maeta said one idea being considered was to reduce the fees charged to tuna vendors and increase the fees for reef fish vendors.He said this was a way of making fishing on local reefs less viable.""By imposing high market fees on local fishers who contributed to unsustainable fishing in the nearby reefs, it was projected that they would have no other option but to travel into the open seas to fish.""This practice would allow local reefs as common fishing grounds to recover from overfishing.""",7 Apr 2021

Neighbouring Solomon Islands by comparison has no Covid-19 deaths and less than 30 cases of the virus, all of them contained in managed isolation.However the closeness of PNG's region of Bougainville to Solomon Islands, and the fact it has over a hundred confirmed cases of the virus, continues to the government in Honiara.Health authorities in the Solomons capital have already been vaccinating frontline health workers in the capital.The country received its first shipment of 24,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine a fortnight ago.But a senior advisor to the Solomons health ministry, Dr Yogesh Choudhri, said their biggest concern was the western border.""Because that is where the real risk lies. So we are trying our level best to prevent unauthorised entry into Solomon Islands at the western border.""But still as a proactive measure it is important for us to boost the immunity, the community level immunity in the western border.""Dr Choudhri said that of the 24,000 doses of Astrazeneca, 7,000 will be used in the capital Honiara and 17,000 in the country's west.",6 Apr 2021

Mannaseh Sogavare said it was extremely disappointing that people in frontline ministries hadn't turned up.In a national radio address he said that ""when you sign up to be a public servant you sign up to serve and to protecty your people and your country"".Sogavare also expressed his disappointment that only 600 Solomon Islanders in total had been vaccinated when the country has 24,000 AstraZeneca vaccine doses available.His comments echo those of the country's Minister for Health, Culwick Togamana who said frontline health workers who refuse vaccination against Covid-19 should be taken off the frontline.The Solomons' national vaccination rollout began last week after the arrival of 24,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, supplied through the Covax facility.Sogavare was the first to get the jab, followed by other leading officials including the health minister.Togamana told parliament he was ""extremely disappointed"" that a number of health workers were hesitant to get vaccinated.Frontline workers who are not vaccinated, they should be removed from taking up disfela duty, and also disfela special allowance directed by the Public Service, it (should) also be removed from them.""Togama sought to assure the public that the vaccine was safe.""If the honourable prime minister and also the minister of health, they are not frontline workers, but get the jab, does that not sink in (with people)?

There is no denying it. So what we are doing is our health promotion team is going to each ministry and we are doing sessions with the ministry, so the uptake was very positive.""At the same time he said they were wary of over-selling the vaccines.""Because we still only have 7000 doses for Honiara. So going full-fledged [on promotions] has also got its own disadvantages.""Solomon Islands was expecting to receive more than 80,000 more doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through the global covax facility by June.However, Yogesh Choudhri says this is no longer looking feasible and they are looking to get more vaccines through bilateral arrangements.""We will be receiving 50,000 doses from PRC, China in the first week of April or I guess the right date is 11 April,"" said Dr Choudhri.The 50,000 doses which will be arriving from China are the Sinopharm vaccine which has yet to be approved by the World Health Organisation.Dr Choudhri says they will not be stored and only used if approved by WHO.""But we are expecting that the WHO approval should come within the first week of April,"" he said.The Solomon Islands government is also in talks with the government of India to supply several hundred thousand doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.Meanwhile community awareness is already underway in the western part of the country in preparation for the vaccination drive roll out next week.",1 Apr 2021

Speaking to reporters in Palau, where he was attending the inauguration of the island nation's new President, Surangel Whipps Jr, Wu accused China of ""forcing itself into the Pacific"".""There's already a very clear awareness of what China is about ... China's way of forcing itself into the Pacific is going to cause strategic problems,"" he said.Palau is one of a dwindling number of Pacific countries that maintains diplomatic relationships with Taiwan, with Kiribati and Solomon Islands switching allegiances from Taiwan to China in 2019.Both those countries were reportedly offered large sums in foreign aid by China before making the switch.Wu said Beijing's One Belt, One Road initiative, the signature foreign policy of Chinese President Xi Jinping - which aims to build infrastructure and increase trade with China in developing nations through cheap loans from Chinese banks - was creating a ""debt trap"" for developing countries.""China's One Belt, One Road initiative has been moving all the way into the Pacific,"" Wu said.""What it does is lead China's very strong political influence, at the same time as leaving many countries in this region in a very serious debt trap.""Several Pacific nations - including Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu - are believed to be some of the most heavily indebted countries in the world to China.Both Canberra and Washington have voiced concerns about the level of Chinese loans in the region, fearing it would allow Beijing greater control over the Pacific's assets.Wu's comments echoed those of Whipps, who in a speech following his swearing-in, warned of ""foreign aggressors"".Close observers said the comment was directed at China.While most of his speech was in Palauan, the new President briefly broke into English in a clear message for those listening overseas.

He thanked partners like Australia, the United States, Japan and Taiwan for assisting Palau with its Covid-19 response and development, and said those countries ""helped us be protected from our foreign aggressors, and help combat climate change"".Palau is considered Covid-free, and thanks to its close relationship with the United States, is poised to become one of the world's first countries to be mostly vaccinated against the coronavirus.
Palau has already started vaccinating its citizens against Covid-19, with its outgoing president, Tommy Remengesau, among the first to get the jab, in the first days of this year.

Palau is one of just over a dozen countries in the world that maintains formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan instead of China. China considers Taiwan to be a breakaway province, and does not allow diplomatic partners to recognise both Beijing and Taipei.""Although our friendships at times may not be taken well by others - some nations have even tried to muscle their way into our country, as they have elsewhere - Palau has rightfully refuted these aggressive actions and will continue to do so,"" Whipps said.After 36 years of ties, Solomon Islands ended relations with Taiwan. What did it cost Beijing to win over the Pacific nation's old friend, and what might it mean for stability in the region?Wu said he ""recognised"" the Palauan President was talking about China in his remarks, and urged Australia and other democracies to fight Beijing's ""outward expansion of authoritarianism"".He also said Taiwan had been ""thinking about military strategy"" in order to defend against Beijing's threats, pointing to multi-billion dollar arms deals made between Taipei and the outgoing Trump administration.""Those kinds of weapons are necessary for Taiwan to be able to defend itself against the possible Chinese assault,"" Mr Wu said.""We need to make more friends understand ... Taiwan as a frontline state of democracies that is guarding against the expansionism of Chinese authoritarianism.""

President Whipps announced the creation of a ""sterile corridor"" to allow for Covid-safe travel between Palau and Taiwan.""The 'sterile corridor' between our countries will revitalise personal, medical, educational, and business relationships between our countries,"" he said.""It will boost Palau's economy, in our time of desperate need … For the purposes of Covid-19, a trip through the new sterile corridor will be like taking a domestic flight.""Taiwan's foreign minister agreed the proposed travel bubble would attract many Taiwanese people to Palau, but warned that ""strict measures"" had to be maintained to protect both countries from a deadly Covid-19 outbreak.""I think Palau is going to attract lots of Taiwanese tourists who want to go abroad for some enjoyment,"" Wu said.""Still, even though Palau is Covid-free, one of the reasons why it's able to maintain [its] Covid-free [status] is because of its very strict measures.""Palau - whose economy depends heavily on international tourism - has said its private sector unemployment rate was approaching 50 per cent because of job losses related to the pandemic.-ABC",23 Jan 2021

The government is putting a temporary ban on the social media platform until it can bring in new controls.Facebook is a major means of communication in Solomon Islands, according to Ruth Liloqula of Transparency International and a ban was ""one of the most stupid things the government could do"".""They're not thinking about the fact that we've got this pandemic ... we have positive cases that we still have to deal with,"" Liloqula said.""Facebook is all over the country.""About 20 percent of the population of 650,000 has access to the internet, according to Georgina Kekea of the Solomon Islands Media Association.The government has been using Facebook to broadcast speeches and share information on Covid-19.It is also used as a forum for public discussion and connects expats with family back home.""Facebook is the main medium they use to get information and also share what they know,"" Kekea said.It was concerning to the association when people's voices were being suppressed and it was against their constitutional rights, she said, although she said people could bypass the ban using other platforms..The government should have been more proactive rather than reactive, she said, given the new undersea cable linking the country to Australia.""They should have prepared the laws already.""

Transparency International executive director Ruth Liloqula questioned the timing of the move when scamming and other abuse of Facebook had been going on for a while.She believed the government just couldn not take the heat of adverse reaction to its recent economic stimulus package.""A lot of people are really pressing the government to make an explanation why some constituencies are getting $3 million and why some are just getting $600 and why the economic stimulus package has to go through members of Parliament at all,"" she said.Instead of a ban on Facebook, there needed to be more education around social media use, she said.""And work with other countries that have got legislation in place to fast-track bringing in some legislation to deal with what we are seeing coming into the country.""Currently a lot of people are being scammed of their money by these scammers from all over the world.""The local chamber of commerce said the ban was a threat to many businesses and would bring negative press on the world stage.Spokesperson Natalina Hong said many were already struggling in the pandemic and they depended on Facebook to link with their customers locally and overseas.Solomon Islands was not an easy place to do business, she said.""A lot of opportunities come through this sort of platform,"" Hong said.""We see this as our link to the world. This will be cutting out a bridge for us to grow as a country (and) have people have confidence in doing business or investing in Solomon Islands.""Thousands of fans of the national sport of football would also miss out, according to Siaosi Tafoa of the Solomon Islands Football Federation.He said all its domestic competitions were streamed live on Facebook .""We rely mainly on Facebook to market our players overseas and also we don't want to lose our followers who are following the games live from around the region.""I think a ban on Facebook would not only affect the marketability of the game and our players but also cause a lot of frustration from fans who are following the games.""A ban would put the Pacific island nation alongside just four other countries in the world where the social media platform is not allowed - China, Iran, Syria and North Korea.

Minister of Communications Peter Shanel Agovaka told RNZ Pacific that Facebook had been grossly abused in Solomon Islands.He cited character assassination, unsavoury posts and the need to protect the vulnerable as reasons for the ban.""Coming with freedom of expression and freedom of the media is a lot of responsibility. You don't just go out and say things out of the ordinary to your neighbours.""It's about using it wisely, share information and so on, not to abuse people.""Agovaka said the ban was only temporary until laws could be brought in to better control and govern the use of Facebook.""We are behind other countries in putting [out] legislation,"" he said.Cabinet was also looking at banning the Messenger app, he said.""We are ensuring the use of the media, particularly Facebook, is for the good of the people.""With Solomon Islands under a state of public emergency because of the pandemic, Agovaka expected the ban to be brought in as soon as possible and draft legislation put out in the new year.",19 Nov 2020

Reports from Samoa indicated MSC was considering a ban on Samoan seamen because the government had apparently refused to repatriate stranded nationals, unless companies met the costs of repatriation.However government-owned entity, Samoa Shipping Services, said it handles the placement of seafarers with shipping companies worldwide.Its CEO called the email leak an act of ''sabotage'' saying it was part of an extended conversation on the repatriation of stranded sailors.Lautimu'ia Uelese Va'ai said MSC was still hiring Samoan sailors, contrary to rumours.He said the email circulating now was just part of a longer conversation between management in ironing out and finding the best options.A repatriation flight from Los Angeles arriving in two weeks was expected to carry the first lot of sailors with the government saying 170 would return before the end of the month.Hundreds of Samoans work on cruise ships and merchant ships around the world.Meanwhile in Solomon Islands..The government has scheduled a repatriation flight from Fiji this week.This was confirmed in a statement from the Solomons High Commission in Suva calling on all citizens intending to board the flight on Thursday that the deadline for pre-departure Covid-19 tests is tomorrow.It also advised foreign nationals, who would like to catch the flight, they will require prior government approval from Honiara.Tickets for the flight can be purchased from Solomon Airlines.Passengers are advised to eat prior to the flight as there will be minimal catering onboard and also facial masks must be worn at all times.In Honiara all passengers will undergo additional screening and be required to quarantine for 14 days in supervised government approved facilities.",16 Nov 2020

Communications minister Peter Shanel Agovaka confirmed the decision to Solomon Times Online, saying public misuse of the platform was the main concern.""Abusive languages against ministers, prime minister, character assasination, defamation of character - all these are issues of concerns,"" Agovaka said.The country was lacking legislation on internet usage and cybercrime, which was particularly worrying when it came to what children were accessing and being exposed to, he said.""The use of the internet now in Solomon Islands needs to be properly regulated to safeguard our young people from harmful content.""It was not an attack on freedom of expression, pointing out that freedom of the press was still protected, he said.Agovaka also said the decision would not require Parliament's approval.""The government is still in discussion with the operators to work out how this can be done. The operators shall need to establish a firewall to block Facebook.""However, Agovaka said the initial decision, made last week, did not take into consideration the economic impacts of the decision, which would be investigated fully before the ban was imposed.There are only four countries in the world where Facebook is banned around the clock - they are China, Iran, Syria and North Korea.However, North Korea's ban is indirect because it is a complete internet ban.

Vokia in turn lost the seat after being found guilty of bribing voters.But, in an increasingly common practice in Solomon Islands politics, Vokia's wife, Ethel Lency, is running in the upcoming by-election to try and reclaim her husband's seat.Similar scenes are playing out in the Central Honiara constituency where Jenny Fugui, the wife of the disgraced former MP and cabinet minister, Moffat Fugui, is contesting her husband's former seat.Fugui was also found guilty of bribing voters.But unlike the Guadalcanal by-election there is a much broader field contesting the constituency in the capital with 10 candidates including two other women.

A Joint Border Operation Team has been holding discussions about the Covid threat with chiefs in Solomons' Western Province near the PNG border.The Team's Inspector Kerry Sireheti said that for months people had been adhering to the border closure under public emergency provisions introduced to prevent the virus reaching the country.But he said efforts to secure the border were increasing, and recent meetings with chiefs in the Shortland Islands were aimed at helping them prepare for health security too.""I try to integrate them into the system so it's going to be everybody's responsibility to actually look after the security aspect of the community, as well as adhere to the Covid-19 regulations as per the State of Emergency which governs the border at this point in time.""It's a kind of strategy to actually collaborate with the communities, because we know in our culture you cannot bypass the chiefs, the chiefly systems,"" Inspector Sireheti explained.""You have to work with them because they command the people. It is not us that command the people.""It gives us the opportunity to concentrate more on the border, if we integrate them so that they can be able to manage the people back in the villages.""So far cross-border movement has been mostly well contained by the Solomons. But securing the border in a maritime nation continues to be a big challenge as police have a huge area of operations to monitor.Inspector Sireheti said securing a border was a joint responsibility with neighbouring countries, but noted that border surveillance efforts in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville remained under-resourced.""As far as I'm concerned, diplomatically, Solomon Islands is actually on top of the security management of the border to ensure that the border is safe from people illegally crossing over.""But when we look at the AROB (Autonomous Region of Bougainville) we didn't see much that is happening at the border. The sad thing is we don't see the support that required from them by their central government.""

The disease has not reached Solomon Islands, which banned pork imports from infected countries in April.But the Solomon's director of biosecurity, Francis Tsatia, said farmers were being warned to look out for symptoms.""Also we've been trying to inform them about feeding pigs. There are certain things that we don't allow the farmers to use as feed, especially left overs from restaurants.""Pigs could contract African Swine Fever by eating infected pork.Awareness material including signs, posters and videos had been distributed to Choiseul, Western Province and Honiara, with plans to cover at least seven provinces, Tsatia said.""With farmers, we are trying to inform them of the seriousness of the disease, what they need to do if they see pigs dying. We've informed them to have biosecurity systems in place.""It's mainly backyard farming here, probably around one to three pigs per family but when you add all this together it's quite a huge number.""We're tailoring our awareness to these small scale farmers but we do have some huge ones too. Our information is that it's easier when you are dealing with commercial piggeries because you can control them. They have proper fencing.""Travellers coming into Solomon Islands were also being targeted, Tsatia said.""Our message to the travellers is don't bring any pork, even tinned pork. We also put emphasis on any materials that could be infected. If they have been to farms, we put that through our passenger declaration.""Humans cannot contract African Swine Fever but could carry it on clothes or shoes contaminated with fluids or faeces from sick pigs.PNG pocket infection contained by cullIn Papua New Guinea, road blocks had been set up to prevent the movement of pigs and pork meat out of the 'disease areas', Enga, Hela and Southern Highlands.

Ilagi Puana, chief veterinarian with PNG's National Agriculture and Quarantine Inspection Authority (NAQIA), said the objective was to stop the disease spreading down through the Highlands to coastal provinces where there are wild pigs and commercial piggeries.A ""pocket infection"" at Mount Hagen in Western Highlands had been ""contained and eradicated"", according to a NAQIA release.Puana said it was brought there by a family who migrated from Enga with a sick pig. Three or four animals were eventually put down after land owners reacted quickly to the threat and called in NAQIA.""We are still monitoring, we have people on the ground there since the pigs were culled. It's almost two months now. We are lucky. I think the awareness is having some impact. This is a pig cultured society. Anything to do with pigs they are very concerned.""NAQIA had documented the deaths of about 700 pigs from African Swine Fever in the disease areas but the veterinarian said the death toll was likely to be much higher.""There's about 700 we have on record but I think it's more than that. There's a lot of pig deaths that were never reported to us. I'm assuming in the region of two to three thousand.""Over the next six months, awareness in PNG would target ""small holder piggeries and also village pig holders... to make sure they confine their pigs"".""If they are using a tether system, they need to tether and make sure there is somebody looking after it all the time. Those are behavioural changes we want to establish,"" Puana said.As to how the disease was introduced to PNG, infected pork meat imported from Asia is believed to be the source.""We have evidence that this pork meat has gone up to the Southern Highlands where there is a construction company,"" Puana said. ""There was a lady working at the campsite. She was taking some of the kitchen waste to feed her pigs and that's how we think it's happened.""

Speaking at his swearing in ceremony Mangau, who is from Ontong Java in Malaita Province, said he was humbled by the new opportunity to serve Solomon Islanders.His appointment is significant in Solomon Islands' historical context given the breakdown of public trust in the police during bloody civil unrest in the late nineties and early 2000s in Solomon Islands, a period known as the Ethnic Tensions or simply the Tensions.During this period police weapons and resources, most of them stolen, were used in the fighting and some police officers took sides in the conflict joining local militia in terrorising citizens.A regional assistance mission sanctioned by the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders and led by Australia and New Zealand helped restore law and order and start Solomon Islands recovery.Commonly referred to locally by its acronym RAMSI the mission also helped rebuild the local police force from the ground up starting by laying off most of the officers who played an active role in the conflict.Mostyn Mangau said his appointment reflected all the hard work that had been put into that rebuild.""My appointment as Commissioner is an expression of the confidence our Government and people have in the more than 1,500 officers in the RSIPF.""We have come a long way since the dark days of the social unrest which brought not only the country but also its police force to its knees.""Mangau also appealed to all police officers and to the national and provincial governments, community leaders, women and youth and all citizens of Solomon Islands to support him in his new role.""With your support and through the hands of our Almighty God we will continue to maintain the Hapi Isles status that our beloved nation has become known throughout the region and the world,"" Mostyn Mangau said.

And so there are no checks and balances and oversight being exercised,"" Wale said.The Opposition Leader also said unlike Australia and New Zealand where there were different alert levels, 1 through 4, - Solomon Islands' emergency legislation was akin to jumping from 0 to 10 without anything in between.Regarding the motion to extend the current State of Emergency, Wale said with the lack of any alternatives parliament really had no choice but to approve it.""I take heart Mr Speaker in the statement by the prime minister that businesses schools, transportation and every other part of society and the economy should be able to function as normally as is possible,"" he said.""That Mr Speaker points to the fact that there is this need for that legislative work so that there is that other category that we can go to without resorting to that option of last resort.""In wrapping up his contribution to the debate, Wale commended front-line workers and the government for keeping Solomon Islands free of Covid-19 while still calling for urgency on the development of alternative emergency legislation so that another four months of a State of Public Emergency might be avoided.

The foreign ministry said the deal would provide tangible benefits, including improved market access, and support for trade development and policy needs.The ministry said of major interest to the Solomons was the labour mobility arrangement which is an annex to the agreement.It said this component would allow Solomon islanders to work in Australia and New Zealand.Solomon Islands is the sixth country to ratify Pacer Plus.The agreement comes into force 60 days after at least eight of the 11 signatories have ratified.Trade advisor calls for Aust rethink on PACER PlusHowever a trade policy researcher has called on the Australian Government to re-think the Pacific trade deal.A a policy brief for the Australian parliament from the Griffith Asia Institute, suggests Australia should take a new approach.Researcher Wesley Morgan, said, as part of its 'Pacific Step-up,' Australia needed to step away from what was an orthodox trade deal offering little to help Pacific producers.Dr Morgan wanted to see more thought put into helping Pacific farmers overcoming the barriers they faced.""In terms of quarantine issues, in terms of transport costs, and it definitely should be linked with the 'Step-Up' and the Australian aid programme because aid should be linked to finding and supporting value chains that can provide an ongoing livelihood,"" he said.

This week the Solomon Islands Maritime Safety Association submitted its report into the incident for a Board of Marine inquiry.On 2 April the MV Taimahero embarked on an inter-island crossing despite maritime warnings advising vessels not to take to sea because Cyclone Harold was in the area.The ferry hit very rough weather and in the early hours of the morning of the third 27 people were swept overboard by the heavy swells.All perished at sea with only some of the bodies recovered.Shipping information published by the WAC Community Company Ltd advertising their ferry's ill-fated journey ended ""Safe travelling and God bless"".The director of the maritime rescue coordination centre, Jonah Mitau, confirmed their report was submitted on Tuesday and a two-week Board of Marine inquiry will begin on 27 April.Mr Mitau declined to comment on the contents of the report but pointed out that it looked specifically at the maritime safety aspects of the tragedy.Police investigationMeanwhile police are preparing to travel to Malaita Province to speak with the survivors of the MV Taimareho ordeal as part of a criminal investigation.The acting Police Commissioner, Mostyn Mangau, said while good progress was being made he felt it was important for people to understand that determining who was liable for the deaths would take longer than the maritime inquiry.""We are progressing very well with our investigations here in Honiara with the avenues we are looking at in our investigation.""Right now we are waiting for finances to be made available so that officers can travel over to Malaita to get statements from people who travelled on the boat,"" Mr Mangau said.The government was preparing to send a team of professional counsellors to help the provincial government and local churches who were supporting victims' families.This was part of a pledge made by the prime minister Manasseh Sogavare in a national address last week.""The Government is committed to provide humanitarian assistance to families of the victims and to meet cultural obligations and proper burials for those who lost their lives,"" Mr Sogavare said.Shortly after the tragic incident occurred the MP for West Are Are, John Maneniaru, criticised local search and rescue capabilities saying people could have been saved if they were better resourced and prepared.But his comments backfired with hundreds of locals on social media questioning why the ferry was allowed to leave port in the first place given other shipping companies had cancelled their trips in accordance with maritime safety warnings at the time.

It was also the first since the mid-2017 departure of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands.For the report, locally-led research teams spent three weeks in 15 constituencies observing the electoral process and interviewing almost 5000 people.

It concluded that the election was, for the most part, conducted in a peaceful manner and that expectations of a free and fair election were generally met.However, some observers witnessed election candidates handing out benefits such as cash and material goods on the eve of the election - known locally as the 'Devil's Night'.The head of the ANU observer team, James Batley, said most of the voters interviewed were clear about expecting direct benefits from their elected representatives.""These can be all sorts of benefits such as material goods such as roofing iron or outboard motors. Solar kits also benefits not just to their household but to their village or to their community in terms of upgrading infrastructure like clinics or schools,"" Mr Batley said.Mr Batley said that focus on benefits was reflected in some of the irregularities in the voter registration process.For instance, more than 50,000 people applied to change the place where they were registered to vote.""Because they were looking for greener pastures in terms of more responsive members of parliament.""So, this has become quite a phenomenon in the election that almost one in eight voters changed the constituency that they were registered in.""The report contains a comprehensive list of recommendations, including removing barriers to the participation of women, and stopping MPs from using constituency development funds for personal and political gain.

The flagship research product of Transparency International, the index offers an annual snapshot of the degree of corruption by ranking countries and territories from zero to 100 - zero being highly corrupt.In 2018, Solomon Islands climbed to 44 points on the scale - from 39 the year before - thanks to the passing of anti-corruption and whistleblower legislation.But not much has been done to implement the laws so the latest index sees the country dropping to 42.Ruth Liloqula, from Transparency International Solomon Islands, said recent events meant she expected the score to be even lower.""Such as the elections, one of the most corrupt in the country. It was the highest number of petitions launched against winning candidates.""Then we have the China thing where civil society's space and voice and activism was restricted. And also we have an executive government that is imposed that has never contested or that is formed after the elections.""

So we are having three sitting women MPs for the very first time in the Solomon Islands parliament. So that is a very, very satisfying result,"" he said.The East Makira by-election was called after the sudden death, in July, of Mrs Maefai's late husband, Charles Maefai, a first time MP who had only been elected three months earlier.Mr Saitala said he understands arrangements are being made to try and get Lillian Maefai to return to the capital Honiara from her constituency sometime in the next few days so that she can be sworn in on the floor of parliament before it adjourns for the year.The other women MPs in Solomon Islands current parliament are Freda Soriacomua, the MP for Temotu Vatud, and Lanelle Tanangada, the MP for Gizo Kolombangara.In the 41 years since Solomon Islands gained its independence from Britain, Lillian Maefai is only the fifth woman to be elected to the country's parliament.The first woman to be elected in Solomon Islands was Hilda Kari representing North East Guadalcanal in the 1980s.

The Foundation's President, Paul Driessen, said he travelled to Malta last month and had a range of ""frutiful"" meetings with a range of clubs in the Maltese Premier League and First Division.""We got a very good feeling with Maltese Premier clubs. Tarxien Rainbows FC, a professional club of this top tier, is very interested. "" he said. ""We showed them the profiles of several players and Joses Nawo and Atkin Kaua were selected.""31-year-old Nawo and 23-year-old Kaua were first identified following a training camp held in the Netherlands in May as part of the Solomon Islands' preparation for the Pacific Games.""Our idea was to not only to prepare the team for the Pacific Games, but as well another objective for us in the foundation was to gain a lot of media attention so that people know that Solomon Islands has a lot of talent,"" Driessen explained.'Atkin was assessed by the Dutch coaches during the 2019 Pacific Games campaign as the player with the highest potential, career wise. He is still at an age where he can develop himself to a higher level while Joses Nawo is seen as the most complete player of the national team.""

Driessen said Malta is an ideal location for Pacific Islands players looking to break into top-level football because it does not have the same restictions on foreign players as other European leagues.""Malta does not have all these requirements. It's the perfect hub for those who want to make it to Europe,"" he said. ""The professional league is of a very high standard. The top five clubs of the 14 clubs that make the Maltese Premier league, they are comparable to a Dutch top league level.""""It will be very tough, but Malta is a good start,"" he said.

One of the most complete players of the international football team of the Solomon Islands. He can really be of straight value within the team,"" Driessen said.""It's straight re-inforcement, an investment in future you could say, take a young player, Atkin is a bit younger, so he could be holding a transfer value for example but at the same time to increase the level of the club.""""It is a brilliant opportunity. They are opening the gate for more Pacific Islanders going to Europe. Now, if they make it, they will survive the trial, they get a contract and then everyone in Malta knows about the Solomon Islands and they truly open the gate for more talent to be provided.""Tarxien Rainbows FC will provide accommodation and meals for the players, who are expected to spend 14 days on trial, but Driessen said Nawo and Kaua have less than week to find sponsors willing to cover the cost of their flights to Malta, or else they may not be able to take up the opportunity.""As a foundation we have done our part so it is now up to a sponsor in Solomon Islands in getting him funded. A delayed arrival is not possible because the Maltese Premier League kicks off for the second half of the season at the 10th of January. Tarxien Rainbows FC needs time to examine Joses Nawo so he has to earn this contract with a successful trial.""",15 Dec 2019

A range of government ministers from 15 Pacific island countries have been holding a forum in Nadi to discuss how to boost resources for young children in the region.Fiji's Minister for Health and Medical Services said now that the council and its steering committee were in place, the hard work could begin.Dr Ifereimi Waqainabete, who is also the Chair of the Ministerial Roundtable meeting, praised the multi-sectoral nature of the council and its 10-year work plan.The head of UNICEF, Henrietta Fore, opened the forum with a video message stressing how important early moments are in a child's life.""Early moments matter. The nutrition her parents give her. The love care and protection she gets and the early brain stimulation she receives through playing and interacting with friends and family. Together these ingredients wire her brain for success. They connect neurons at a once in a life time pace. They benefit her, her family and her society.""Ms Fore questioned why more countries were not following the initiative shown by the Pacific region by investing in early childhood development with a science-based structured programme.A recent World Bank study found children born in 2019 may only reach half their full potential as adults if access to critical public services like health and education is broken.Stunted physical growth affects one out of every three children in most parts of the Pacific, and island nations have the worst rates of arrested development in the world.A Solomon Islands nurse who works with UNICEF, Glenda Rathamana, sees patients such as 14-month-old Dorcas, who is 31 percent smaller than average for her age.She had intervened with a plan to correct the child's nutrition at a crucial window in time.""Stunting and malnutrition can have a major impact on children as they get older. It causes problems like learning difficulties in schools and non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart problems, obesity. So if we don't correct it at this stage when they are still children, they will develop these problems when they're older.""Specialist health clinics for young children to help educate parents with life saving information on child nutrition and health are likely to be extended further regionally as part of the 10-year plan.Underlining the importance of the council, Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General, Dame Meg Taylor said the future of the Blue Pacific was not guaranteed.""Our young people are confronted by what are being increasingly identified as non-traditional human security challenges. Improving access to early childhood development needs to be addressed within a complex environment where our children also need improved access to health including vaccine and hygiene services. Furthermore, our children need greater protection against abuse and exploitation.""Pacific Representative for UNICEF, Sheldon Yett, said establishment of the Council was timely.""The first one thousand days is that critical window when we really need to make sure a child has access to good nutritious foods, has a loving and supportive family, and is getting ready to go to school. It's really a very critical window when those neurons and when the synapses in the child's brain really start to form.""That's why its so important to intervene agressively and intervene early.""Pacific children needed action - not just words and commitment, Mr Yett said.UNICEF was working with regional governments, and stands ready to support governments in the Pacific to assess how policies, systems, services and programmes, can better provide for children in the Pacific.The Pacific Regional Council for Early Childhood Development represents 15 Pacific Island Countries and territories, including the Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tokelau, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.UNICEF, Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Council for Early Childhood Development, is hosting the forum this week, with funding support from the Government of New Zealand and in collaboration with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, the World Bank and regional partners.",25 Oct 2019

A strategic cooperation agreement signed last month between the Central Provincial Government and China Sam Enterprise Group which granted exclusive development rights to Tulagi and its surrounding islands, was ""unlawful, unenforceable and must be terminated with immediate effect,"" Attorney-General John Muria said in a statement Thursday.The five-year lease deal has alarmed locals on Tulagi, Solomon Islands officials and Western diplomats since it was reported in local media.Central Province Premier, Stanley Manetiva, who signed the agreement on 22 September, has maintained the deal is not legally binding and would not be possible under Solomon Islands land laws.""The issue is no longer an issue anymore,"" he told RNZ Pacific in an email on Wednesday, declining to comment further.China Sam has not publicly commented on the Tulagi deal but executives with the group met with Solomon Islands Prime Minister Mannaseh Sogavare when he visited China this month, weeks after diplomatic relations opened between the two countries.The agreement contained vague references to trade and minerals, including a possible oil and gas development as part of a ""special economic zone"". However, its broad wording could have enabled China Sam to build strategic assets such as deep sea ports, according to one senior Western diplomat.Mr Muria, the attorney-general, said the agreement signed had significant legal ""defects"", including an illegal clause which would exempt China Sam from having to obtain Foreign Investor status under Solomon Islands laws.The deal was also not vetted by the attorney-general's chambers, as required of all provincial and national level agreements, he said.",25 Oct 2019

The prime minister last week announced China had promised grant funding of more than $US50 million to support the country's hosting of the games, the ABC reported.Mannaseh Sogavare's announcement came after an historic state visit to China following the severing of diplomatic ties with Taiwan.A senior advisor to the Solomons Government, Clint Flood, said since the diplomatic switch they had met twice with teams from China about support for the event.Beijing was now considering a Solomon Islands' proposal, which involved China taking over Taiwan's previous commitments including the construction of the Main Stadium and several other key venues, Mr Flood said.""So before when we had Taiwan doing the main stadium, and then some other projects beside it,"" he explained.""We've now consolidated and said well we believe that China would be interested and possibly would support a revised complex which would have a main stadium, and next to it, some other required facilities for the Games.""The timeline the national authority was working to aimed to have construction beginning mid 2020 with all facilities to be completed by December 2022 six months before the games opening ceremony, he said.Solomon Islands was also in the process of finalising funding commitments from other donor parties for the games.",22 Oct 2019

But already cracks abound: there has been no official announcement and the provincial premier says the deal is on ice.Experts say the arrangement in Central Province would give the developer and other Chinese firms a strategic inlet into Solomon Islands, which until last month was one of Taiwan's dwindling allies in the Pacific.The government traded Taiwan for China in a move that it said would promise more development for the nation.The Central Province agreement, signed 22 September, would give Beijing-based Sam Group an exclusive five-year development lease for Tulagi island and its surrounding islands, according to a copy which was shared on Facebook on Friday by a Solomon Islands youth group which is pro-Taiwan.RNZ Pacific has verified the leaked copy's authenticity with two sources who are familiar with the agreement's contents.Central Province premier, Stanley Manetiva, confirmed he had signed the ""strategic cooperation agreement"" in Honiara with representatives of Sam Group, but said it was not legally binding and the company would have to comply with local laws and respect landowner rights on Tulagi.""To be honest here, leasing Tulagi will not be possible,"" he said in an interview. ""Nothing will eventuate on the agreement.""A phone number for Sam Group's office in Beijing listed on its website was disconnected on Friday. Another company listed as a party to the lease agreement, Xiamen International Trade Group, could not be reached for comment.According to a statement posted to Sam Group's website, a Solomon Islands delegation visited its headquarters in August.The two parties ""hoped to carry out comprehensive cooperation in energy, chemical industry, investment, trade and other fields in addition to existing cooperation,"" the statement said. It was unclear whether the visiting delegation was from Central Province.""We want the investors to come to our province,"" said Mr Manetiva, adding the diplomatic switch had opened investment opportunities for Solomon Islands. ""But we must be mindful, mindful in a sense that we must see that the people are our priority.""Not everyone's convinced the deal with Sam Group is as non-binding as Mr Manetiva claims.'A lot of concern' Solomon Islands' deputy opposition leader, Peter Kenilorea Junior, was worried the lease would still go ahead.""It raises a lot of concern for me, I didn't see any protection, or at least any obligation in the agreement that I saw that also safeguards the interests of Central islands province peoples and the resources.""As part of the Tulagi lease, Sam Group would be able to survey the island for oil and gas developments, despite what Mr Kenilorea Junior described as a sizeable anti-mining movement on the island.Central province, which hosted the former capital under British-ruled Solomon Islands, has a relatively small population of around 26,000 people, but covers a vast area of more than 600km2 of mostly-ocean. The province is also located close to the Guadalcanal, where the current capital Honiara is.Mr Kenilorea Junior said the province's strategically central location might have made it a target for a Chinese developer like Sam Group.""This may be a means to sort of piggybacking other companies into the Solomons,"" said Anna Powles, a senior lecturer in security studies at Massey University in New Zealand.She questioned whether one of Sam Group's subsidiaries, China Jing An, was privately-owned because it was previously part of China's Public Security Ministry.""My sense from other research and other companies similarly, is that there are still very strong ties there.""Still, local businesses on Tulagi have welcomed what they say is sorely-needed development on the island.""We don't have any banks and services here is quite low, and having investors to come and improve the place would be really great,"" said Teika Dennis, the owner of the Vanita Motel and Restaurant.",14 Oct 2019

But it was also part of the association's longer term build up to the 2023 Pacific Games which will be hosted by Solomon Islands.There are many challenges for all sports associations and federations in Solomon Islands in preparing for the games, but Mr Tapsell said the main factors were a lack of sports facilities, funding and administrative know-how.""Just to give you a sense of the practical challenges faced by boxing, there are no dedicated boxing facilities really in the whole country,"" Mr Tapsell said.""And there are various challenges associated with our relationship to international governing bodies. Finding the money to finance affiliation fees to those bodies.""Finding qualified referees and officials for major tournaments was also a problem.""Unfortunately in the Solomon Islands at present we don't have any officials that are qualified in accordance with the international regulatory body for amateur boxing. Which is a rather big issue here for the sport of boxing in terms of moving forward,"" he said.

But Mr Tapsell said it was not all doom and gloom.""One area that certainly is not a challenge is with the enthusiasm and motivation of the boxers,"" Tapsell said.

It means New Zealand will now have two football teams at the Olympic Games after the U-23 men's national team joined the Football Ferns in booking a ticket to Tokyo.Des Buckingham's side had dominated the qualifying tournament in Fiji and underlined their superiority in the final this afternoon, overcoming the Solomon Islands 5-0 to deservedly earn regional bragging rights and secure an Olympic berth in the process.The sides had met in their final group game last Friday and it was a thriller on that occasion, the Kiwis triumphing 4-2 in an absorbing encounter. They again found the net multiple times this afternoon at Churchill Park in Lautoka but the Solomons could not get close to them this time and the outcome did not look in doubt by the time the half-time whistle was blown.New Zealand had charged out of the blocks in their semi-final victory over Fiji to effectively win the match within 30 minutes and they did likewise today, again racing into a three-goal lead by the half-hour mark.Captain Logan Rogerson led by example to open the scoring early on, pouncing on a loose ball after Clayton Lewis had released Ben Waine down the left and it took just 20 more minutes for New Zealand to find a second, Myer Bevan following up after neat interplay between Lewis and Rogerson.New Zealand had one foot in Tokyo soon after as Waine was teed up by Rogerson, the move having been started by a quick free kick from Gianni Stensness.The Solomon Islands were never likely to come back from three goals down against a side yet to taste defeat in this tournament and so it proved as New Zealand confirmed their Olympic berth with two more goals in the second half.Golden boot winner Bevan struck his 12th goal of the tournament with 20 minutes remaining from a well-worked free kick routine with Lewis and it looked like that was the end of the scoring as the match entered stoppage time. But defender Billy Jones then popped up to head in yet another Lewis free kick as New Zealand signed off on their time in Fiji in style.""I just said to the boys that that final was the perfect game,"" Buckingham said.""To win a final 5-0 against a very good Solomons team and put New Zealand into the Olympics for only the third time in history is a huge achievement for this group,"" he added.""I can't quite put it into words, it's an unbelievable feeling right now. It's very emotional but I'm very pleased and proud for the playing group, and not just the 20 that we here but the 70 or 80 that have been part of this journey and will continue to be part of it over the next eight or nine months.""",5 Oct 2019

Four years ago, Fiji won the qualifiers by beating Vanuatu on penalties after New Zealand was disqualified for fielding an ineligible player.A lot has happened since then with New Zealand amassing 22 goals, and conceding just three, on their way to topping Group A of the tournament.Coach Des Buckingham told OFC TV his side was in good spirits.""The mood is really good, really nice environment, good environment, the players are really positive,"" he said.""We have got everybody available for us, no suspensions, so we are just looking forward to playing Fiji.""The team was ready to deal with a parochial and loud home crowd at Lautoka's Churchill Park.Buckingham knew playing a Pacific side at home made for a unique challenge.""We had this with the [U20s] World Cup Qualifiers last year in Tahiti, where we played Tahiti as the hosts,"" Buckingham said.""Once in our group stage and then again in the finals.""It is nice to be here but to play the hosts is going to be a bit of a challenge and of course they are the current holders of this competition so we will focus on ourselves and we will be ready for the game.""Fiji enter the game off a 1-0 loss to Vanuatu and their coach Marika Rodu admitted New Zealand were heavy favourites.However, he said they were not unbeatable.Despite New Zealand's impressive form, Rodu said the fact that Samoa and Solomon Islands had scored against the kiwis gave him encouragement.""Samoa and Solomons have demonstrated that goals can be scored against New Zealand so [it's] a matter of the right ingredients, pinpoint defending and pinpoint finishing and managing the game well and also our behaviour,"" he said.Rodu said getting over the psychological hurdle of facing the regional giants, New Zealand, was also a challenge.""The mental block that we need to get past, if we can deal with that, I think we can be in a good space to deal with New Zealand.""Rodu says his side would need to be at its best to win.

Today's second semi-final will see Vanuatu take on Solomon Islands.Vanuatu finished top of Group B by defeating Fiji over the weekend and are undefeated, while Solomon Islands picked up the loss to New Zealand.However, Vanuatu coach Etienne Mermer said that counted for nothing and he expected Solomons to bring their speed game this afternoon.""They have their own way to play. They are very fast, quick, technically they are good,"" he said.""This is the way Solomons team, most of the time they have quality in their team. But for us, we also have some players who they can also give them a good challenge.""The Solomon's side placed second in Group A after suffering a 4-2 loss to New Zealand in Suva last week.Despite their different win-loss records, Solomons coach Batram Suri said the competitive showing against New Zealand had them well placed for today's match.He said it would be a great clash against a traditional rival, but the team was ready.""The last game [was] a test of character for our players to prepare for the semi-finals. We did well against them, though we conceded four goals, we still fought, and I thought 'we are here to compete',"" Suri said.The Solomons coach said he knew many of the Vanuatu team well through working with them in club play over recent seasons.

The two sides made the final courtesy of victories over Fiji and Vanuatu respectively.A Solomon Islands football team has never made an Olympics while four years ago Fiji made their Olympic debut, after New Zealand was disqualified from the OFC Qualifiers for fielding an ineligible player.However this time around New Zealand ended Fiji's dream of making their second consecutive Olympics, thumping them 6-1, after racing to a 3-0 lead after half an hour.Despite hot and humid conditions at Lautoka's Churchill Park, the New Zealanders took complete control of the game keeping the home side scoreless until a 73rd minute goal from replacement Mohammed Shah.Full international Liberato Cacace and captain Logan Rogerson impressed early on, and it was Rogerson who created his side's opening goal by sending the ball into the box before Fiji defender Scott Mara deflected it into the net.Rogerson scored himself after a Ben Waine goal, before Myer Bevan completed the scoring for the first half.Fiji started the second half strongly with skipper Kishan Sami and Bruce Hughes both making stirring efforts and Scott Wara and Joeli Ranuti not capitalising on chances.New Zealand benchman Callan Elliot and Bevan concluded the game's scoring with the latter finishing with a brace to take his tournament tally to 10 goals.Fiji finished the game with 10 men after Akeimi Ralulu was sent from the field for a second yellow card.New Zealand coach Des Buckingham told OFC TV he was delighted with his side's clinical display, especially in hot and sticky conditions.""It was tough, 32 degrees with a 12 o'clock kick off, very trying but full credit to our playing group, for them for what they did, especially in the first half we they have done enough,"" he said.""The second half was a little bit scrappy, but we have done enough in the first half, and for them to continue working in this kind of heat and this kind of humidity was a real win for us, and it's important now for us to recover for the final,"" said Buckingham.He said the team would spend the next couple of days looking at areas to improve on but there was nothing big.""Our focus was always on arriving in the final, and scoring goals and they have done that with 28 goals in four games.""We also wanted to play well and we have shown that over the four games, we got better and we just want to arrive in the final better again,"" Buckingham added.Fiji coach Marika Rodu admitted New Zealand deserved their victory.""The gap remains between us and New Zealand and we need to patch this gap in the near future, but the work that has been done by New Zealand is marvellous,"" he said.Melanesian rivals Vanuatu and Solomon Islands met in the second of day's semi-finals, and kicked off in expected fashion with some fast-paced action.

Vanuatu looked likely early on with a number of darting runs down the flank by Bethuel Ollie and positive play from Ronaldo Wilkins.However the Solomons started to make their way back into the match with an Augustine Waita chance going over the crossbar .Both teams went back and forth before a Frank Kabui pass to set up Waita to score in the 37th minute.Vanuatu's task got tougher when Tasso Jeffrey was shown a straight red card in the second half for a dangerous tackle.Vanuatu continued to battle on gallantly despite the deficit in score and manpower, coming close to levelling the score before the final whistle put paid to their campaign.Solomon Islands now meet New Zealand on Saturday in a replay of their Group A encounter from last week in which the latter come through with a 4-2 win.Solomons coach Batram Suri said while he was happy with the result there was still a lot to do.He admitted Jeffrey's red card helped his side.""Yes it was crucial, but I thought despite the red card we had to play our own style, and they pushed us and it felt like we played against 11 players, but yes it was crucial for us,"" Suri said.Despite his side's exit, Vanuatu coach Etienne Mermer praised his players' spirit.""It's hard to explain, we came into this match wanting to win it but we didn't manage to do it, but it's life we couldn't come back,"" he said.""But I want to congratulate the boys, they played really well, they played good football today, and we managed to play with ten men and still managed to have ball possession and managed to put the Solomons under pressure.""

As of this morning, the petition had been signed by over 2000 members of organisations working in community development, women's empowerment and youth advocacy in Solomon Islands.The petition accuses the prime minister and his government of being self-serving in their decision making, and calls for a change in leadership.Veteran environmental and political activist Lawrence Makili, said it came after the government issued three new prospecting licences, just months after a major environmental disaster, and made the decision to switch diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China without any public consultation.""Because we see his leadership has brought a lot of problems and a lot of confusions and politically this country is not in stable situation.""So, we are gearing towards specifically demanding him to step down. We are looking at his leadership. We do not want his leadership,"" said Mr Makili, who now volunteers with local NGO Develop Services Exchange.The petition also serves as two weeks notice for a planned public protest rally during which a more detailed list of demands will be presented to the government.Last week, civil society organisations were publicly chastised by the prime minister's office for being vocal about the lack of consultation around the diplomatic switch from Taiwan to China.But Mr Makili said they are unfazed by the harassment and are maintaining a united front in accusing the prime minister and his government of making self-serving decisions without consultation, which they say will be to the detriment of the nation's future.",1 Oct 2019

Mr Hou, who is also a former central bank governor, was sacked as planning minister this week along with the justice minister, Tautai Kaitu'u.Mr Hou said he was dismissed for being vocal in caucus and cabinet about the need for more consideration and consultation before the switch.Solomon Islands' 36 year relationship with Taiwan ended last week before the Solomons' foreign affair minister, Jeremiah Manele, and his Chinese counterpart formalised ties on Sunday.Mr Hou said the Solomons had launched a formal process to consider the switch, and the government was to consider reports from four different review panels before deciding.But halfway through the process, Mr Hou said it was clear that the decision had already been made.""It was already predetermined this decision and what the government has been doing in the last couple of weeks is trying to legitimize this... and to try as much as possible to comply with (a) cabinet sanctioned process which, as we now found out, it has not been done,"" Mr Hou said.Even more worrying was that a taskforce exploring the merits of switching to China had recommended the Solomons do so before 1 October, he said.According to Mr Hou, the chair of the taskforce later admitted that the recommendation was based on a request from Beijing that the switch happen in time for the 70th anniversary of China's national day.Compounding Mr Hou's disappointment is the fear that China will exploit weak laws and regulations in Solomon Islands.Solomons institutions could be corrupted by Beijing and Chinese companies, he said.""The way they do business is anything but transparent and my greatest fear is this is going to really cripple all institutions of good governance and compliance law and order enforcement and (you) name it. All these institutions are going to be crippled by this,"" Mr Hou said.Now that the switch has been made, Solomon Islands should move quickly to strengthen legislation, he said.But given the rushed manner in which the switch was made, Mr Hou said he was afraid it was already too late.",27 Sep 2019

It will be the first time the Solomons competes at a football world cup when it takes the field in Brazil next month.The Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) had lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport regarding the eligibility of Solomon Islands footballer Chris Satu, endangering their participation at the tournament.Satu played for the Solomon Islands during the OFC Under 16 Championship in Honiara last September.In February, the OFC found Satu was born prior to 2002 and his participation breached championship regulations.The country forfeited all five games Satu appeared in at the tournament, meaning the Solomons lost their World Cup qualifying berth.However, the Solomon Islands Football Federation (SIFF) won an appeal against that disqualification which has now been backed by the Court of Arbitration.Solomons U17 coach Stanley Waita said he was excited by the latest ruling.

The Pacific had been a stronghold of support for Taipei as its diplomatic allies steadily dwindled. Until this week, six countries in the region recognised Taiwan over China. But in terms of population, Solomon Islands and Kiribati were the biggest.The first domino to fall was Solomon Islands. Since the government of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare was re-elected last year, there had been persistent murmurings about a potential switch that only grew louder when a taskforce formed by Mr Sogavare recommended a change in relations.On Tuesday, Taipei tried to front-foot an imminent announcement from Mr Sogavare, declaring that ties with Solomon Islands had been severed with immediate effect.At 11:30am, the Taiwanese flag in Honiara was lowered, and the plaque removed from the embassy entrance. A plane was on its way to take their diplomats home. All technical and medical personnel would be leaving, too.""This is a choice the Solomon Islands government has made, leaving us with no other option but to respond in this way,"" said Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen.On Friday, the second domino fell.Kiribati president Taneti Maamau made an announcement on national radio. His country would also be switching to China. That, too, brought swift rebuke from Taiwan.In a statement, foreign minister Joseph Wu said Taiwan ""deeply regrets and strongly condemns the Kiribati government's decision"" and accused Mr Maamau of holding ""highly unrealistic expectations regarding China.""The statement said Mr Maamau had recently sought financial assistance from Taiwan to help buy airplanes for the national airline, Air Kiribati. The Taiwan government had suggested lending money to buy the planes, but the Kiribati government had instead demanded a donation.""According to information obtained by Taiwan, the Chinese government has already promised to provide full funds for the procurement of several airplanes and commercial ferries, thus luring Kiribati into switching diplomatic relations,"" the statement read.Mr Maamau and the Kiribati government were unable to be reached for comment on Saturday.Taiwan is ruled by the Republic of China government in Taipei, where it has been based since it lost a civil war on mainland China to Mao Zedong's communist forces in 1949. Beijing considers the island its own territory - a renegade province - and neither Beijing or Taipei will maintain diplomatic ties with countries that recognise the other.

As the flag lowered outside the Honiara embassy on Tuesday morning, a large mournful crowd had gathered to farewell the ambassador, Oliver Liao. Local staff were in tears as Mr Liao embraced them a final time on his way to the airport.""Our friendship continues, especially our friendship with the civil society, we continue to regard you as really good friend,"" Mr Liao told the crowd. ""Over the past few years, in my tenure serving this embassy, I have been so deeply touched by your support and your friendship.""""We really love you,"" he said ruefully.Later on Tuesday, a crowd marched through central Honiara protesting the decision by the Sogavare government.The premier of Malaita province, Daniel Suidani said his people were not happy with the switch, with the change the latest touchstone for the independence movement there. Mr Suidani said he would push for independence to maintain ties with Taiwan, if there was backing from Malaitans.An opposition politician in the national parliament, Peter Kenilorea Jr, said the government's hasty decision was ""regrettable.""Mr Kenilorea, who is the son of the country's founding prime minister, was once the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is the current chair of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said the signs for the future were already ominous.""The reality is that we will be expecting a lot of interest now from such a dominant partner, and the fact that we are already marching to their drumbeat … is an ominous sign that they are already dictating our every next moves,"" he said.In Kiribati, there was a similar reaction there, too.

""We cannot understand the decision,"" said Sir Ieremia Tabai, a former president who is now a leading opposition parliamentarian. ""At the last election they said to the public that there would be no change in terms of recognition of Taiwan, so we are very surprised that they made the decision now.""""They don't have the mandate to change the recognition,"" Sir Ieremia said.But unlike Solomon Islands, it is not the first time Kiribati has changed colours. For 23 years from 1980, Kiribati maintained relations with Beijing, even hosting a Chinese satellite tracking station on South Tarawa, near a similar US facility in the Marshall Islands.That was until former president Anote Tong switched to recognise Taiwan in 2003, and the Chinese satellite facility and embassy in Tarawa were promptly abandoned.Sir Ieremia said that if the opposition was elected to government in elections that are due to be held in Kiribati next year, then diplomatic recognition would be switched once again.The Solomon Islands prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, was adamant that there would be no going back. In an 11-page statement released to media on Friday night, he defended his cabinet's move, saying any decision otherwise would have been irresponsible.""While we cannot deny the longstanding friendship we have maintained with Taiwan, the future stability and wellbeing of Solomon Islands depends on our own ability to engage at the international level with development partners capable of advancing our national interests,"" he said.Mr Sogavare stressed that recognising China would not mean taking on risky loans or falling into a debt trap, as Taiwan's president warned in her announcement.Losing its two largest diplomatic allies in the Pacific is a significant blow for Taiwan and its president, Tsai Ing-wen, ahead of elections on the island in January. Since she was elected in 2016, seven allies have fallen to Beijing amid rising tension between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.

The latest decisions by Solomon Islands and Kiribati are likely to ripple through domestic politics there, analysts have said, with elections less than four months away.Ms Tsai, a pro-independence politician, will be fighting for re-election against Han Kuo-yu, an opponent who is friendlier towards China.But that local dynamic was one of the justifications given by Mr Sogavare in his statement.""The Solomon Islands is better served making a decision that reflects our long-term development interests rather than being uncertain over what might happen should one day Taiwan democratically decide to reunite with mainland China,"" he said.For now though, Taiwan's remaining allies in the Pacific are remaining steadfast in their support.The Marshall Islands and Palau, both countries in free association with the United States, have confirmed their continued backing for Taipei, and Tuvalu's new prime minister, Kausea Natano, on Friday affirmed his country's continued support.However, the government of Nauru's new president Lionel Aingimea is yet to comment publicly about his country's relations with Taiwan.But that doesn't mean Taipei and Beijing won't continue hustling.At a news conference on Friday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Geng Shuang, was asked whether China was pushing for Tuvalu to switch recognition.""China's position is consistent and clear,"" he said.

The two governments made a statement which also noted that Indonesia had not yet given access to Papua for the UN Human Rights Commissioner.The statement was delivered at the council's latest session by Sumbue Antas from Vanuatu's Permanent Mission to the UN.It followed weeks of protests and related unrest in Papua which left at least ten people dead and dozens of Papuans arrested.The Melanesian countries told the council of their deep concern about ongoing rights violations against the freedoms of expression and assembly, as well as racial discrimination towards Papuans in the Indonesian-administered provinces of Papua and West Papua.They echoed last week's call from the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, for Indonesia to protect the fundamental human rights of Papuans.""Related to this agenda item, we are concerned about the Indonesian Government's delay in confirming a time and date for the Human Rights Commissioner to conduct its visit to West Papua,"" Mr Antas said.For years, the UN Human Rights Commissioner's office has been trying to secure permission from Jakarta to visit Papua region.Indonesia's government has indicated that, for the time being, access to Papua would remain restricted because of the security situation created by the recent unrest, which was triggered by racist harassment of Papuan students in Java last month.Six thousand extra Indonesian military and police personnel were deployed to Papua to respond to the widespread protests. The government also implemented restrictions on internet coverage in Papua, although this was gradually being eased as of last week.

There is really limited budgets to fulfill these requrements for CITES,"" Rosalie Masu said.

Solid Black, Bokz Boyz, Sound Temple, Black Centipede and Red Star Unit are just a few of the bands from the heyday of Solomon Islands' rock and heavy metal.But today the country is more commonly known for its own genre of music, Solomon Islands Reggae.This was inspired by the regional and international success of pioneering artists like Sharzy and groups like Onetox, DMP and Dezine, who frequently tour the Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand.This year Jaro Local became the first Solomon Islander to win the award for Best International Artist at New Zealand's Pacific Music Awards.But a new breed of heavy metal bands in the country is bucking the dominance of reggae. Among them are Earthbound, Forbid and Sons of Solomon.

The Sons of Solomon, not to be confused with the New Zealand reggae band of the same name, is leading the charge against the common misconception that only reggae, hip hop, rhythm and blues, and gospel music are popular in the Pacific.Lead guitarist Floyd Kofela said based on positive feedback following the release of singles 'Follow' and 'New Beginning', he believed there was still a large heavy metal fan base in the country.""For me, I just feel like metal music has a part to play in the whole music industry in Solomon Islands. So we just want to complement Solomon Islands music as a whole and be part of the Solomon Islands music industry as well,"" Kofela said.Fearly Kofana, who sings the clean vocals for Sons of Solomons, has lived and played in heavy metal bands in Papua New Guinea. Kofana said all across Melanesia he had met fans who followed the Solomons' small but vibrant metal scene.""I think in all the Melanesian countries, the Solomons is the centre of heavy metal. Because of the British influence even way back when rock and roll was popular in Solomon Islands,"" Kofana said.""Up until the era of the likes of Sharzy and other island artists then it started to die out. But how I see it, there are still a lot of people who love heavy metal in Solomon Islands.""

David Gegeo, the director of research at Solomon Islands National University, said thousands of Solomon Islanders were kidnapped and later contracted to work in Australia in the 1800s, a practice known as Blackbirding.Its legacy includes intergenerational anger that could be relieved, if the complete history of the practise were taught in schools, Dr Gegeo said.""There was grieving over people leaving but also there was anger when people were taken. People still talk about those stories with a certain degree of pain, anger and frustration,"" he said.""'What did we do to deserve this? We were taken away to develop someone elses country, economy'. Yes, there is still some anger.""From listening to oral histories, Dr Gegeo said Blackbirding had disrupted social fabric in Solomon's villagers and caused disputes.""For example, Fiu harbour on Malaita where I come from, after young men were taken, a chief, or what we call in Kwara'ae a fata'abu, would curse the harbour because people were kidnapped from the harbour. Anybody who was seen in the harbour, even just walking along the beach would be killed. And there were bounties,"" he said.

""Another impact: two friends went to the beach and one of them was taken away. The parents, or the tribal group of the kid that was taken away, would be angry and would demand compensation from his people, saying 'it was your son who took my son to the beach that day and he was kidnapped. If it hadn't been for his friendship with your son this would not have happened'. So sometimes compensation, killing took place because of it.""""Also, the fact that young men who are supposed to be in the village and doing tribal responsibilities were taken away. It left a gap and women suddenly had to step into men's roles because able bodied men were taken away.""The school curriculum in the Solomons only focuses on the so-called benefits of Blackbirding, Dr Gegeo said, the result of history being ""deemphasised"" by the ""colonial regime"" as a means of modernising the country.""It's taught under Social Studies. The bit about Blackbirding is very highly selective in that it emphasised mostly what you might call the benefits of blackbirding,"" he said.""People coming back with guns and knives and axes, Solomons Pidgin and Chritianity but not the other side of it which is the suffering and the agony that Blackbirded Solomon Islanders went through.""I believe in presenting a balanced picture of the phenomenon.

Those plans have been shared obviously with donor countries so for instance this week we signed the agreement with the government of the Republic of China Taiwan to fund the main stadium.""""The contract has been signed with the contractor, we know exactly how much it's going to cost and obviously the two governments have worked out a loan programme and a repayment programme based on that.

I want to have these venues done December 2022 and not two weeks before the Games.""Mr Flood said for Solomon Islands hosting the 2023 Pacific Games is about more than just two weeks of sporting competition.""We want to use the Games as a catalyst to clean up the city, they want to sort out some water control quality issues so the big lesson I think is these Games are about a whole of government approach.""""You have to have every single department working together to ensure that we all come together for the Games but more importantly what's the vision 25-30 years down the road.

The survey by the child protection agency ECPAT International shows perpetrators are most likely to be family members or a close family friend.It was a small study but showed children were being abused for profit at an appalling rate, according to the director of ECPAT International New Zealand, Eleanor Parkes.""We saw again and again in this research that more often it's not a ""stranger-danger"" situation.""More often it is coming from someone that is known to the child so a family member or a close family friend,"" she said.Researchers surveyed 84 welfare workers in Fiji, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Tonga, Samoa and Kiribati.Eighty percent of them had managed cases of child sexual exploitation in the past year.""It's sexual abuse that has a particular commercial aspect to it, so there's someone profiting from that abuse,"" Ms Parkes said.Factors impacting on children's vulnerability include poverty, religious beliefs, culture and shortcomings in the justice sector.Increasing access to the internet and technology in the Pacific was making children more vulnerable to sexual exploitation, the study found.The lack of awareness about where the offence lies when it comes to technology was concerning, Ms Parkes said.""People know that it's illegal to take photos or videos of child sexual abuse but there was much less awareness around the fact that the third party, that person who watches the videos or accesses those images, are also committing an offence and that's on the increase as well,"" she said.The study also pointed to more opportunities for exploitation because of increasing trade and travel in the region.Child sexual exploitation was happening around remote logging camps, set up by foreign companies, according to some of the welfare workers.Ms Parkes said raising awareness among parents and within communities is crucial to encourage children to speak up about exploitation.ECPAT has come up with several recommendations including awareness campaigns and training for parents and specialised police units.Its report also recommends challenging the culture of silence and taboo around sex to get people to report abuse and seek help, particularly in tight-knit communities.""One thing that was coming through in this research is that when things were reported they tended to get followed up on.""The rates of an investigation and even a conviction were higher than I expected to see at least.

The Tiki Toa went into the match as heavy favourites having beaten the Bilikiki 11-6 during their group stage encounter two days earlier.The first of three periods brought no goals scored and it wasn't until late in the second that Solomon Islands went in front thanks to a powerful drive by Allan Farobo.

But the hosts responded a few minutes later with back to back goals from Patrick Tepa and Heiarii Tavanae to take a 2-1 lead into the final period.Tavanae struck again to give the Tiki Toa a 3-1 buffer before McPhillip Aisa pegged a goal back for Solomon Islands, who were attempting to retain their Oceania title won back in 2013.However, Bilikiki goalkeeper Fred Hale gifted the hosts an opportunity to restore their two-goal cushion after conceding a technical foul and Heimanu Taiarui made no mistake, converting from the penalty spot to give Tahiti a 4-2 lead.Roy Mafane managed a consolation strike for Solomon Islands with 12 seconds left on the clock but it wasn't enough to prevent Tahiti from claiming victory and securing their passage to a fifth-consecutive Beach Soccer World Cup.

Water supplies in the Solomon Islands capital continue to be affected by logging, with some of the city's water supply shut down for two days last week.The Kongalai catchment, in the hills above Honiara, is where 40 percent of the city's water comes from.Two logging sites upstream from the Kongulai intake - one legal and the other illegal - has unleashed sediment into the river.So, for the past few months, the water intake has had to be shut down when it rains, as sediment levels skyrocket.Last week, some parts of Honiara were without water for as much as 48 hours in what is becoming a regular occurence.""The key underlying cause of increase high turbidity are the illegal or unmanaged logging activities upstream in the Kongulai catchment water area,"" said Ian Gooden, chief executive of Solomon Water.""This is a big challenge for us as we are a victim of these activities but we have a responsibility to provide safe and healthy water to our customers""The government says the logging in the catchment has been reined in, but the effects will be felt for some time.The chief executive of Solomons Water, Ian Gooden, apologised to customers, saying there were plans for a new treatment plant at Kongulai - but that won't be ready until late next year.

The Solomons has recognized Taiwan since 1983 and would be a prized chip should it swap diplomatic ties as China seeks to expand its influence and presence in the Pacific.A taskforce set up by Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare to review the Taiwan relationship will visit Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Papua New Guinea which all have formal ties with China.The tour will begin this week and also include Beijing and Taipei, taskforce chair John Moffat Fugui told Reuters.""We will use their countries as case studies to see the kind of development relations they have, the kind of assistance they get, the conditionalities or lack of conditionalities they might have, the kind of governance,"" Mr Fugui, a government legislator, said by phone from the Solomons' capital, Honiara.""We will do due diligence,"" he said, adding the taskforce report was expected by the end of August and could recommend a middle course.""It's not either or, it's also both,"" he said, without elaborating on such a scenario.The Solomon Islands is among 17 nations to recognise self-ruled and democratic Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province with no right to state-to-state ties.Although the relationship with Taiwan comes with generous aid payments, the Solomons sends two-thirds of its exports to China and is weighing the merits of a change.China's footprint in the Pacific has been growing, with governments there owing about US$1.3 billion to Beijing and raising fears in the West that the region is becoming more susceptible to Chinese influence.Although Pacific islands offer little economically to either China or Taiwan, their support is valued in global forums such as the United Nations. The Solomons - the scene of decisive battles in World War II - is a particular flashpoint.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison this month made the first visit by an Australian leader to the Solomons in a decade, and the United States has urged Pacific nations with ties to Taipei to maintain the status quo.Mr Fugui said the seven-member taskforce could leave as early as Thursday and would keep an open mind in meetings with foreign leaders, diplomats and business leaders during the tour.""I think there are concerns about the countries that have relations with China in terms of the style of development they have because China is a great power,"" he said.""In terms of a small island state, that is a huge jump from having relations with our traditional partners...(but) at the same time we need to catch the opportunity to look at it and look at it properly.""- Reuters",25 Jun 2019

Last week, amid diplomatic visits from both Australia and New Zealand, the Solomon Islands Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele said the government would take its time to make an informed decision.The director of the Centre for Pacific Studies at the University of Hawaii, Tarcisius Kabutaulaka, said China's aid focus on large infrastructure projects was appealing to some Solomon Islands MPs.But leaders need to consider whether the country can manage not only the potential debt that could be incurred but also the intensity of a relationship with China, he said.""Think about whether or not we are prepared for a relationship that is going to come with intensity both in terms of diplomacy as well as in terms of investment and how we can best benefit from it,"" Dr Kabutaulaka said.""So at the end of the day it is interest of the Solomon Islands people that is the most important thing.""Dr Kabutaulaka also said Australia and New Zealand's actions in the Pacific speak louder than their attempts to play down concerns over the Solomon Islands considering cutting diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of China.In their official statements during last week's visits to Solomon Islands, both Australia and New Zealand said they were not putting any pressure on the country either way.But Dr Kabutaulaka said Australia's Step Up and New Zealand's Pacific Reset policies told a different story.""We cannot get away from the fact that Australia and New Zealand have ... have done in recent years attempted to strengthen their influence in the Pacific Islands region vis-a-vis the rising presence or assertive presence of the People's Republic of China,"" Dr Kabutaulaka said.",13 Jun 2019

The previous parliament in 2016 exempted its members from paying income tax. It also granted itself a swathe of untaxed allowances and approved a 300 percent increase to so-called 'terminal grants,' a one-off payment made to MPs at the end of each four year term, just before an election.The tax-free decision provoked a public outcry and a challenge in the courts, but the High Court ultimately sided with the MPs.Still, the Parliamentary Entitlements Commission, which sets MPs' pay, in March decided to revoke their tax free status, which was welcomed by organisations including Transparency Solomon Islands.However, the commission has raised MPs' pay to offset the money that will be lost to tax in what the commission's secretary, Derick Vagi, referred to as ""grossing up.""""To say there is a massive pay jump is wrong,"" said Mr Vagi. ""The take home pay is no different.""Mr Vagi said the pay for an average Solomon Islands MP is now 7646 Solomon Islands dollars a fortnight, which is about $US953. About 40 percent of that would be lost to income tax, he said, which takes the MP back to what they earned while tax-free.The Prime Minister, Manasseh Sogavare, will be paid SBD$11,843 (US$1453) a fortnight, according to a parliamentary gazette.

Solomon Islands finished runners up at the UEFA tournament: coming from behind to beat Moldova in their opening match and losing to Belarus and Kazakstan on penalties, after both matches had finished all-square after 90 minutes.Stanley Waita says his players held their own against some of the best young players in Europe.""I did not expect them to perform that far but they show some character, they show a lot of energy,"" Stanley Waita said.""And going to Europe to play in the tournament we don't know what the level or how did the other countries in Europe play. We just go there without knowing anything and we just perform with our heart.""However Stanley Waita said the players still have a lot to learn and need to improve their discipline, after ending their final match against Kazakhstan with only nine players on the pitch, after Raphael Lea'i and Philip Ropa were sent off.He said the team was approached by people who were interested in signing some of the Solomon Islands players but they advised them to go through the correct channels through the national federation.",11 May 2019

Solomon Islands police have arrested more than 30 people for offences following disturbances in Honiara in the wake of the election of Manasseh Sogavare as prime minister on Wednesday.Police say some members of the public took the law into their own hands and marched through Honiara, causing public disturbances, fighting and property damage.Significant damage occurred at the Pacific Casino Hotel and a number of vehicles were also damaged.Marches had been banned by police during the prime ministerial vote and the Solomon Star newspaper reports that police may make further arrests.Five police and four prison officers were injured during the rioting.Police in Honiara are working throughout tonight to control reports of a mob wanting to enter into the city centre. https://t.co/RZp9cgSVD1 @SamisoniPareti @Netrika #honiaratension #pmsogavare #solotensions #melapoli pic.twitter.com/Sf5ZAaIaMYPolice fired teargas to control mobs in Honiara. https://t.co/lr2E5OqPki @SamisoniPareti @Netrika #solopolitics #pmsogavare #melapoli pic.twitter.com/EgONbPGrxd",25 Apr 2019

Mr Sogavare told the Solomon Star the decision was taken in light of the country having recently been caught in a very awkward situation over mining issues.Earlier this year a cargo ship ran aground on a reef off of Rennell while trying to load bauxite from a mine on the island.It eventually spilled hundreds of tonnes of heavy fuel oil into the ocean causing one of the worst man made disasters in Solomon Islands in recent times.The whole saga has revealed inadequacies in Solomon Islands mining law when it comes to holding mining companies accountable for environmental disasters caused by their operations.In the Rennell case, the mining company Bintan Mining continues to deny liability for the spill and has said it would be suing the ship's owner.Manasseh Sogavare said his government is committed to delivering new legislation for the mining sector as part of a larger aim to build a broad-based and environmentally sustainable economy.Mr Sogavare said he hopes the new law will create a robust and conducive local mining sector that can attract good investors.",8 May 2019

Since early February, bulk carrier, Solomon Trader, has been wedged on a reef off Rennell Island, where it has spilled an estimated 100 tonnes of oil.The spill happened near a protected marine area and poisoned local water supplies and fishing grounds, sparking an international outcry.More than three months on, the Solomon Islands Disaster Management Office said the vessel will be refloated and towed from the reef.Its director, Loti Yates, said the process, which is being led by a salvager contracted by the shipowner's insurer, will take around three days.""It is a huge and very, very difficult operation,"" he said.Mr Yates added that cleanup efforts which began in March are ongoing, with oil still coating the shoreline of the nearby and once pristine Kangava Bay.He added that all oil onboard the ship had been removed but based on ship records there was an unknown amount missing.""Maybe they evaporated, maybe they just sailed away or sunk into the bottom of the ocean. Not sure yet.""Mr Yates said investigations by the Solomon Islands government into the disaster had been obstructed by a missing data drive taken from the ship by its owner.He said requests for the data - which is too big to transfer online - to be sent physically had gone unanswered for the past three weeks.""We are sort of frustrated but we are still hoping that it will arrive.""",10 May 2019

But a lot of uncertainty in the lead up to the election centred around a lawsuit filed by the rival prime ministerial candidate Matthew Wale against Mr Sogavare.Matthew Wale told Connect News he was challenging the validity of Mr Sogavare's nomination for prime minister based on the late registration of his political party.""The case that I lodged was significant for clarifying the application of the laws relating to the nomination and election of the prime minister,"" Matthew Wale said.But a constitutional lawyer in Solomon Islands, Charles Ashley, believes Mr Wale might have left it too late to make the challenge.""What I believe Matthew Wale should have done was before Sogavare was nominated that was the time that he could have asked the High Court to rule on Sogavare's eligibility to be a candidate,"" Charles Ashley said.The conflict or confusion is centred around a piece of legislation called the Political Parties Integrity Act which was designed to try and strengthen Solomon Islands political party systems and reduce instability.
Police deployed to deal with the rioting in Honiara

It was passed by parliament despite the absence of crucial constitutional amendments to render it fully effective.Further complicating Manasseh Sogavare's election as prime minister was a court order obtained by Matthew Wale and delivered to the governor general Sir Frank Kabui just before Wednesday's election calling for the postponement of the process pending the High Court ruling tomorrow.Sir Frank chose to ignore the court order and proceeded with the election prompting Mr Wale and his counterparts to stage a walkout claiming the governor general's action was illegal.""The walkout therefore is for the sake of the rule of law. That the Governor General did not abide by the direction to defer the meeting. A direction of the High Court,"" Matthew Wale said.But Mr Ashley believes Sir Frank was actually acting within the law as the Solomon Islands constitution provides special protections for the governor general and his running of the election of the prime minister.""Schedule two of the constitution says even the courts, you cannot look into what the determination, the deliberation that has been taken by the Governor General,"" Mr Ashley said.

Mr Ashley believes even if the High Court were to rule Mr Sogavare's nomination for prime minister invalid based on the Political Parties Integrity Act it would be rendered ineffective by the constitution which says any MP can be nominated for the prime minister's post.Meanwhile, an uneasy calm has settled over the capital Honiara after Wednesday night's unrest.The Police Commissioner Matthew Varley has said the situation is now under control and he is urging residents of the capital to go about their daily lives.So far 50 people have been arrested in connection to the unrest.The National Referral Hospital has also seen an influx of patients seeking medical attention for cuts and bruises.One doctor has condemned the violence saying a young boy has lost an eye as a result of the lawlessness.

Parliament has confirmed all but one of 50 MPs have reported in following the general election earlier this month.All are required to do so before the Governor General can call the election of the prime minister by secret ballot.In the meantime, two coalitions of political parties have formed, one around the previous prime minister, Rick Hou, and the other around MPs in the previous opposition.Both groups claim to have the majority of MPs but some are listed on both sides.Four political parties have signed a new coalition agreement and are claiming to have the numbers to form the next government.The coalition includes both prime ministers from the last parliament: Mr Hou with his Democratic Alliance Party and Manasseh Sogavare with his newly reformed Our Party. The other two parties are the Kadere Party and the Peoples First Party.In a statement released on Sunday night, the Democratic Coalition for Advancement claimed it had the support of 33 of the country's 50 newly elected MPs.However, only 28 MPs turned up for the traditional coalition group photo shared by the Kadere Party on its Facebook page.
The Solomons Democratic Coalition for Advancement one of two coalitions vying to form the new government in Solomon Islands.

Some of the members in the new group also featured in an earlier formed grand coalition of six political parties, which is also claiming to have the majority of MPs.The parties in the grand coalition are the Democratic Party, United Party, People's Alliance Party, People's First Party, United Democratic Party and the Party for Rural Advancement.The mathematical impossibility of the two coalitions' membership claims are consistent with the Solomon Islands practice of horse-trading among MPs, known locally as the ""numbers game"".The practice is often associated with the government forming period after national elections but is in fact ever present in Solomon Islands politics.It frequently manifests in no confidence motions against the country's prime ministers.In the 40 years since independence, only two prime ministers, Solomon Mamaloni elected in 1989 and Allan Kemakeza in 2001, have ever completed a full four year term.A government in Solomon Islands is considered to be doing well if it is still in power halfway through its term.At the heart of the unpredictable ""numbers game"" is the fact that every MP in Solomon Islands is legally an independent, free to jump ship, change political parties and even start their own political party at the drop of a hat.
Photo: RNZ Pacific/ Koroi Hawkins
New legislation has been brought in to try and give political parties more prominence in Solomon Islands politics by tying the formation of government and eligibility for the prime ministership to party membership.But this last election again saw more independent candidates winning parliamentary seats than party-affiliated ones.It was not until after the election that MPs started to gravitate towards political parties in the hope of being part of a new government.This suggests that political parties in Solomon Islands are still very much a means to an end, more akin to a group of people making the same wager than sharing the same goals.A final important piece to the mathematical puzzle of ""the numbers game"" is the inducements necessary to hold the fractious coalitions together.The prime ministership and senior ministerial portfolios are the biggest bargaining chips, followed by lucrative chairmanships of various boards and licensing regulators.At the bottom of the scale is the much talked about but never proven allegations of hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash paid to undecided or opportunistic MPs to switch sides.Those lowest on the political food chain, referred to locally as ""grasshoppers"" may switch sides multiple times in the coming days or weeks leading up to the formation of government.In theory, each shift is accompanied by a cash payment which has earned the nickname, ""fundraising"".The political wrangling is expected to come to a conclusion when the Governor General announces the date for the election of the prime minister this week.",15 Apr 2019

Environmental damage from extractive industries was in the spotlight again in February when a cargo ship loading bauxite on Rennell island, ran aground on a reef in Lughu Bay, spilling more than a hundred tonnes of heavy fuel oil into the ocean.After weeks of delays, international salvage crews have contained the spill but a massive clean-up operation is still underway with the assistance of Australia and New Zealand.Questions of liability, inadequate legislation and corporate responsibility have been pored over again and again, with the maritime incident being described by the country's prime minister as the worst man-made environmental disaster in recent times.University of Queensland senior research fellow Simon Albert has spent the last 15 years trying to help both the Solomon Islands government and local communities with environmental management and protection.Dr Albert said with most Solomon Islanders living in rural areas, the environment is their social security and safety net but it's being destroyed by logging and mining.""There isn't a lot of effort put into a broader environmental management framework to look at the barriers and interventions that can prevent the Rennell situation from occurring,"" he said.""To think of the environment in the Solomons, I often think about it as a form of social security or welfare,""""So it's the intactness of the Solomons' environment that provides that backstop or that security for people to turn to when they face economic challenges.""",15 Apr 2019

Nearly three quarters of sitting MPs were returned to parliament after last week's election and efforts are underway to form a government.Transparency Solomon Islands is urging voters to be vigilant in holding their newly elected representatives accountable.The organisation's chief executive, Ruth Liloqula, said people needed to realise they were as equally responsible for the actions of their leaders, as they were for having chosen them.""This country can only change if all of us make the effort to make that change,"" Ms Liloqula said.""Your vote is your voice and you only control that but after casting your ballot paper your responsibility does not end here, it has just begun,"" she said.""You also need to exercise that right to hold your leaders accountable for the sake of Solomon Islands.""Meanwhile, as negotiations to form the next government ramp up in the capital, Honiara, a coalition appears to be forming around Kandere, a major party in the last coalition government.The Solomon Islands Democratic Party is the only other party to emerge from the election with at least eight successful candidates.",9 Apr 2019

The Commonwealth observer group has commended the commitment of the people of Solomon Islands to participating peacefully in last Wednesday's national election.In a preliminary statement released over the weekend, its chairperson, former Vanuatu prime minister Sato Kilman, says the group acknowledged the efforts of the Solomon Islands Electoral Commission to conduct the election under the country's new Electoral Act which was brought in just the year before.Mr Kilman said his group observed some positive aspects of the process and also identified areas that could be improved to enhance the country's democratic process.One example of this was the group noted the out-of-constituency voter registration arrangements saw complaints raised about the lack of clarity around the definition of an ""ordinary resident"" and where citizens can register to vote.Complaints were also received about the lack of out-of-constituency voting arrangements for those working in essential services areas such as hospitals and those who have had to travel outside of their constituency for work purposes.The group praised the security operation for the election and acknowledged the logistical support from Australia and New Zealand both to police and electoral authorities.

It, however, noted on polling day that several voters were unable to find their names on the lists at polling stations.They also noted inconsistencies in the way ballot boxes were sealed and labelled and some voting screens needed to be more carefully positioned.Accessibility to polling stations was also quite difficult in some locations although the group noted where this was the case polling agents did their best to assist the elderly and people with disabilities.Counting was still underway when the Commonwealth observer group releases their statement but they said there were several areas that could be worked on to improve the efficiency of the count.Other areas which the group said it would cover in more depth in its final report were concerns about incumbent MPs using Constituency Development Funds in their campaigning, supporting more aspiring women politicians to contest as only 26 out of the 333 candidates were women.It also made some observations on the limit on campaign funding set out under the country's new Electoral Act.",8 Apr 2019

Most of the teams play 4-3-3 and I think that's still the best system but it depends on the players you have,"" he said.""I was talking to the (Solomons) ambassador and he said 'we have to play Total Football'.""I said 'if we have the players, we can do that'.""Rijsbergen was a part of the Dutch team that made the Total Football style famous as it won through to the 1974 World Cup final.

I'm not sure that the selection of the Solomons will be the same as the Dutch team as the 70s but it doesn't matter.""Having coached in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and South and Central America, Rijsbergen said he could be tempted to extend his time in Oceania.""After the Pacific Games, maybe I will stay and travel around Australia and New Zealand.

New Zealand's multi-million dollar investment in tourism in Solomon Islands is about to start paying dividends, with the opening of a new international airport in the country's Western Province.It's expected to open up a region renowned for its pristine waters and considered one of the last wild frontiers on earth.New Zealand has been helping the Solomons develop its tourism industry so it can break its economic reliance on non-renewable industries like logging and mining.Plans for an international airport in Western Province began in 2012 with New Zealand committing US$20 million to tourism development.New Zealand's foreign minister at the time Murray McCully opened the Munda airfield in 2013 and remarked that it would soon be welcoming tourists on international flights.Solomon Airlines' operations manager, Dave Pearce, said that day finally arrived with a flight scheduled from Brisbane on Saturday, 30 March.""This was supposed to happen in April last year and it's been delayed for a number of reasons but we strongly believe that once the service actually starts then sales will take-off,"" said Mr Pearce.Regulatory and technical challenges including the introduction of border control caused the series of delays said Mr Pearce.

Beyond the airport, he said, tourism operators have had access to interest free loans to develop and improve their offerings.""The Tourism Infrastructure Development Fund, it was created with the aim of improving the existing infrastructure at the resorts and hotels and everything else in the Western Province,"" said Dave Pearce.One of those who took advantage of the fund is Titiru Eco Lodge's Kilo Paza who was able to upgrade his business on Rendova Island.""I now have four over water bungalows and three garden bungalows which can now take up to 20 guests,"" he said.People throughout the Western Province had been working hard to ensure it was ready as an international tourism gateway, said Dive Munda's Belinda Botha.""We've also received a bit of help to make sure that our vessels, our boats, are up to international safety standards, making sure that they have been configured to make sure that we can now accommodate more guests,"" she said.""And also be able to offer further away dive sites with the safer configuration of the boats.""Western Province is renowned for its pristine waters and its diving to the remains of sunken WWII ships from the Japanese and American fleets.They have the attractions but Ms Botha said they need to ensure government keeps investing in the marketing and promotion of the region so the airport investment pays off.""This is one of the last wild frontiers left on Planet Ocean and we know for us to be able to keep this place as pristine and untouched, it's not mining, it's not logging, it's not forestry,"" she said.""We know tourism is the way to go.""

New Zealand's High Commissioner to Solomon Islands said Wellington's direct commitment to the airport project was around US$10 million.Moving away from diminishing non-renewable industries like logging is strategically important said Don Higgins.""It is environmentally and socially damaging so we see tourism as a way of providing sustainable income from a source that is non-extractive, if you like.""And also, one of the benefits to the type of tourism we're involved in is the money accrues directly to the provinces and to those operators,"" said Mr Higgins.Sharing his optimism is Dive Munda's Belinda Botha who said Western Province will be attractive to the seasoned traveller who is looking for a new destination.""Our target market is somebody that actively wants to participate in making a positive contribution to sustainable development.""And really growing and expanding an area where we can still make a difference in terms of protecting and conserving our resources,"" said Ms Botha.She expected visitor numbers to increase most from Australia and New Zealand but said Europeans and North American traveller numbers were increasing.The Saturday flight from Brisbane is the start of a weekly service.However, the longer term goal is multiple weekly flights according to Solomon Airlines' Dave Pearce and the addition of services to Sydney and Auckland.

In February, a cargo ship loading bauxite from a mine on the island, during bad weather, ran aground on a reef in Lughu Bay, eventually spilling more than a hundred tonnes of heavy fuel oil into the ocean.After weeks of delays International salvage crews have now contained the spill but a massive clean-up operation is still underway with the assistance of Australia and New Zealand.Questions of liability, inadequate legislation and corporate responsibility have been pored over again and again with the maritime incident being described by the country's prime minister as the worst man-made environmental disaster in recent times.

University of Queensland senior research fellow Simon Albert has spent the last 15 years trying to help both the Solomon Islands government and local communities with environmental management and protection.Dr Albert said as tragic as the Rennell disaster is for local communities it is also an important opportunity for the country to take stock.""If we all reflect on this it is more than just a foreign mining company causing environmental damage. I think we all need to reflect on the various stakeholders whether that is the role of the community, the role of the government, the role of outsiders like myself and the role of international partners in creating the environment and the framework to allow this accident to happen.""In the latest twist of events the Indonesian miner Bintan Mining Corporation, which chartered the stricken MV Solomon Trader, is suing the ship's owner King Trader Ltd.A spokesperson for the miner told the Island Sun they were suing the shipping company as the charterer and on behalf of the people of Rennell Bellona.""We will stand for the rights of the rights of the people of Rennell Bellona to hold the ship owner viable for the incident"", the spokesperson said.",1 Apr 2019

It is the country's first since the departure of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands almost two years ago.The mission, which started in 2003, brought an end to a bloody ethnic conflict that left over 200 people dead or missing, tens of thousands displaced and the national economy crippled.Fast forward two decades and post-conflict Solomon Islands is preparing for the biggest test of its security and stability so far.Crowded campaign rallies and long float parades have been going all weekend with boisterous political supporters decked out in party colours, waving banners and voicing their approval for their chosen election candidate.There are 50 parliamentary seats up for grabs in the first-past-the-post race and stiff competition between cash strapped incumbent MPs promising continuity and everyone else promising change.

""A good leader from my perspective like first somebody who is god fearing, somebody who is righteous, somebody who hates corrupt practices and wicked practices.""Jerrlim Laufilu and many others I spoke to said they wanted better leaders. But in Solomon Islands politics a ""good leader"" does not necessarily mean a good lawmaker.""A person who will take care of us when we go for education to school next year to help with school fees.""I want, if the person I vote for wins, I hope changes will take place in my community""The reason both Daisy and Esther before her, are seeking direct benefits from their Member of Parliament is because of something called the Constituency Development Funds, more commonly referred to as CDFs, over which MPs have full discretion.According to investigative research from Transparency Solomon Islands, since 2010 MPs have spent more than $SBD2 billion worth of tax payers' money through the secretive funds, earning themselves the nickname ""ATMs"". The majority of the spending is unaccounted for.

This is our opportunity to show the world that Solomon Islands is a peaceful progressive country of the future.

And if they do their job properly there should be a fair bit to report because police are already having to deal with rogue political groups going around threatening voters with violence if they do not support particular candidates.Also corrupt election candidates in the country are adapting to its strict new electoral laws and coming up with some innovative ideas in the process.Last week the Solomon Islands Electoral Commission warned election candidates that it was an offence to charter ships or organise transportation to get their own supporters to and from the polls.Out of constituency voting is non-existent in Solomon Islands so it is common practice for wealthy election candidates contesting provincial seats to charter whole ships to get their supporters to and from the polls.But because of the new laws party affiliated candidates are getting business associates and family members to charter ships on their behalf.Independents are having supporters collect cash from agents at random spots around town so at the ticketing offices they can appear to be paying for their own fare to go and vote.

But the most disturbing practice is voters being smuggled out of the capital, boarding ships from inlets, hidden coves and log ponds outside of the capital and away from prying eyes.The last practice also raises safety concerns as the smuggler's boats, which reportedly depart in the dead of night, are not being monitored for overloading.Local police are aware of the reports and are investigating.",1 Apr 2019

Voters in Solomon Islands are being urged to double check the polling stations where they have been registered to vote to avoid disappointment when the polls open next Wednesday.The Chief Electoral Officer, Mose Saitala says voters should make the most of the new sms poll-station-finder or use the [www.solomonelections.net online service].Mr Saitala said voters need to check, even if they think they know their polling station.""Why I want to emphasise people to test their polling stations is because with the massive increases in the numbers of voters. I mean we have about 72,000 increase.""""That means that we have to create another 300 plus polling stations throughout the country. And with that is a re-dividing of people into polling stations,"" he said.Mr Saitala said it would not be good for voters to line up for hours only to find when they get to the front of the queue that their name is not there.For the sms service, voters need to send a text to 288 with their first name followed by a coma, then their surname followed by another coma, then their date of birth in the format day, month then year.One example would be, if a person named John Smith, who was born on the 11th of June in 1989, wanted to use the service his text message to 288 should read john,smith,11061989 once sent an automated reply will give his polling station, constituency and polling number.",29 Mar 2019

One of its authors, Dutch scientist Jan van der Ploeg, said the real number of attacks was likely to be higher because many villages and indeed whole islands were not visited.In the 20-year period from 1998 to 2017 a total of 194 attacks were reported.One third of these attacks resulted in a person's death: 83 people have been killed in total, 31 were children.Some of the accounts captured in the report are chilling.""In 2008, Don Ricky was playing in the sea with some kids from his village, New Land in Marovo Lagoon, Western Province. At dusk the other kids headed home, but the six-year-old boy went back into the sea to fetch his ball. A crocodile suddenly pulled him under. The villagers never found his body.""Jan van der Ploeg, links the increase in attacks to a burgeoning crocodile population since the government banned the export of crocodile skins in 1993 as part of a global push to prevent the reptiles from becoming extinct.""And when they stopped hunting the population was very small but it responded and it recovered very rapidly,"" Mr van der Ploeg said.It is estimated that there are now between 1400 and 2300 saltwater crocodiles in the country.""So there are more and more crocodiles and larger crocodiles than 20, 25 years ago, and that is leading to many more attacks, and is one of the main findings of our report the number of attacks is also increasing and that is really a worry,"" he said.

But it's a complicated problem to address in the Solomon Islands.Killing crocodiles is forbidden in many of the local cultures with kastom stories or folklore depicting them as, taboo, sacred animals or ancestral spirits like in this one abbreviated from the report.""A long time ago one of our ancestors had a son. He and his wife loved their son very much. But one day they noticed their son had a tail ... one day a close relative from another village paid them a visit. He shouted at the boy and chased him out, so the boy went to Wairaha River and it became his home ever since. This was the beginning of our tribe.""According to the report at least five people a year are killed by crocodiles on average in Solomon Islands over the past decade. In the first few months of 2018 alone there were 13 attacks, three of them fatal.Already this year the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force have received several call outs for problem crocodiles. On Malaita the team captured and killed three of the animals after an attack on a 12 year-old girl on New Year's Day. The child survived but sustained serious injuries to her legs.

Mr van der Ploeg said the report recommends including more safety awareness for communities living near known crocodile habitats, more training and help for police to hunt down killer crocs and legalising the sale of crocodile products in Solomon Islands.""So making sure that the people in the villages receive more information on how to deal with the crocodile problem. And if people have a serious problem with crocodiles and they cannot solve it then the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force can come in to assist.""But having said that, Mr van der Ploeg said he thought it important to remember that Solomon Islanders have been living with crocodiles for tens-of-thousands-of-years and have developed their own precautionary measures like always fishing in large groups or making sure you have bright flashlights when going near the water at night.As to the future implementation of the report's recommendations Mr van der Ploeg said staff from the Solomons' ministry of fisheries and ministry of environment were drafting a new crocodile management strategy which they plan to submit to whatever new government emerges after the National General Election on 3 April.

The saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is the world's largest living reptile, with males recorded in excess of 6m and over 1000kg. The largest saltwater crocodile recorded in Solomon Islands was 5.9m, on Isabel.This large and opportunistic apex predator hunts a wide variety of animals, including fish, mud crabs, turtles, flying foxes, dogs and pigs. Prey are typically ambushed in or at the edge of the water. Small animals are swallowed whole, while large ones are dragged into deep water, drowned and then torn to pieces. Large adult saltwater crocodiles will also consider humans as prey.Humans and saltwater crocodiles have coexisted in Solomon Islands for 30,000 years, and crocodiles play a central role in the cultural history of the country. This is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that a crocodile features prominently on the Solomon Islands coat of arms, alongside another man-eating predator in the islands, the shark.",9 Mar 2019

The Solomon Islands caretaker Prime Minister Rick Hou says the government is looking again at the lease for bauxite mining operator, APID and its associate BinTan Mining Solomon Islands.This comes after the environmental destruction caused by a bauxite carrier running aground in Kangava Bay on Rennell Island, which led to 100 tonnes of heavy fuel oil flowing into the bay.Mr Hou said both mining companies, along with the shipping company, are responsible for the clean-up.Furthermore he said the mining companies may be barred from Rennell.""The decision on the company mining lease and development consent will be done when all assessments I have instructed have been completed,"" he said.""We have laws in this country and regardless of the inadequacies in some areas they still form the basis upon which decisions relating to the mining lease and development consent must be addressed.""Mr Hou said Solomon Islands has earned little from the more than 64 loads of bauxite ore that have been shipped off Rennell since the mine started operations.

The abandoned hull of the 200-metre long cargo vessel, Solomon Trader, still sits precariously on the reef at Kangava Bay, in remote Rennell Island, where it was washed up on 5 February. The ship, chartered by an Indonesian mining company, had encountered difficulties while trying to load bauxite during a cyclone.A gash on the bulker's side has leaked about 100 tonnes of oil into the sea, according to environmental assessments conducted by Solomon Islands and Australian authorities, creating an oil slick that extends about six kilometres from the wreckage.The oil spill spells disaster for local communities in Kangava Bay, where hundreds of residents rely on the sea for their food and livelihoods. Pictures from the area have shown normally bright blue water darkened by oil slicks, white sand blackened by sludge, and interviews with residents have told of a heavy stench that makes breathing difficult.""It's part of our life,"" said Colin Singamoana, the premier of Rennell Province. ""We usually use the reef. We also rely on seafood.""As response crews scrambled to contain the spill and pump the remaining oil from the ship, they are in a race against time to avert a catastrophe. Environmental assessments predict a ""high chance"" of the remaining fuel escaping, with the hull threatening to break apart.Anger over how avoidable this environmental disaster was has been compounded by the response from shipping and mining companies involved, which officials from Solomon Islands, Australia and New Zealand have described as slow and evasive.""Our view is that the ship's owners and insurers need to play their part,"" said Don Higgins, the New Zealand High Commissioner to Solomon Islands.In a post to Twitter on Saturday, Roderick Brazier, the Australian High Commissioner to Solomon Islands said: ""The companies involved must take action now"".On Sunday, Australia's foreign minister Marisse Payne weighed in: ""We expect companies operating in our region to meet international standards and take seriously their environmental obligations,"" she said in a statement.

The Hong Kong-flagged Solomon Trader arrived in Kangava Bay from the Chinese port city of Longkou on 5 February, when Cyclone Oma was churning its way through southern Solomon Islands and the north of Vanuatu.The Solomon Islands Meteorological Service was issuing cyclone warnings for much of the country, including Rennell, on 5 February, including specific warnings for mariners to secure their vessels and avoid sailing.Despite the weather, the ship's crew started loading bauxite, the main mineral used in the production of aluminium, from a mine on Rennell operated by the company Bintan Mining Ltd.Cyclone Oma whipped up heavy swells and, somehow, the Solomon Trader was cast adrift in the middle of the night, ending up stricken on the reef a few metres from the shore of Kangava Bay.Where the crew were and how they reacted is still under investigation, and the Solomon Islands government said it had conducted initial interviews with them as part of its inquiries.Mr Singamoana said he understood negligence had played a part in the disaster.""The crew of the vessel left for the celebration of the Chinese New Year, that's what I heard when I was in Rennell,"" he said in an interview from Honiara, the capital.""The crew of the vessel … they went up to the campsite of the mining company and when the storm hit the vessel it was too late to do anything.""The acting director of the Solomon Islands Maritime Safety administration, Jonah Mitau, had also told local media of a lack of crew watching the vessel that night, suggesting it was a breach of the international safety management code.Much of Rennell - including a marine zone that extends three kilometres out to sea - is part of a World Heritage Area, recognised by the United Nations as a global site of ecological significance that's already threatened by mining, logging and climate change. The island is the largest raised coral atoll in the world, and contains diverse and unmodified forests, coral and species.It took days for disaster authorities to reach the ship, which was not leaking initially, according to the Solomon Islands Disaster Management Office. Then, once the ship did start leaking, it took several more days for salvage crews to be deployed.As the abandoned ship started to list, and as oil began to pour into the pristine waters, according to three people with direct knowledge of the operation, the mine continued to operate, with several ships manoeuvering around the Solomon Trader to collect their loads, stirring up oil in the process.According to the governments of Solomon Islands, New Zealand and Australia, the responsibility for containing the spill, cleaning it up, and removing the wreckage, lies with the ship's owner, King Trading Ltd, its South Korean insurer, and the miner, Bintan Mining Ltd.King Trading Ltd did not respond to requests for comment.But they've acted frustratingly slow, according to government sources, with one saying action was only really taken once international pressure was applied.""It's frustrating that it's taken so long in such a sensitive area,"" Mr Higgins said.Nearly a month on, work is finally gaining momentum. Solomon Islands has asked Australia's maritime agency to lead the response, and several military flights loaded with equipment and experts have arrived in the country. A ship is en route to Rennell from Australia which will be anchored at Kangava Bay as an operations centre.

New Zealand's government said it had deployed two experts from Maritime New Zealand and would consider further assistance alongside Australian counterparts.""There is a high risk remaining heavy fuel oil on the vessel (currently estimated at over 600 tonnes) will be released into the surrounding area,"" Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.Meanwhile, the oil spill was being stirred in the currents, Mr Singamoana said, leaving locals and officials to peel the sticky bitumen-like sludge from their white sand and rocks.He said locals were being told to avoid seafood, their main protein source.Despite best efforts to protect it, Mr Higgins said that it was likely the world heritage area would be affected in some way.He said pressure continued to be applied for the companies to step up, as frustration towards them continued to mount. On Monday, the Solomon Islands government was talking of taking legal action against the companies and possibly suspending Bintan's operations on Rennell.That frustration has reached Canberra too. ""Australia is profoundly disappointed by the slow response of these companies, and their lack of adequate communications with and responsiveness to the Solomon Islands government,"" the DFAT statement said.""We are using our international network and standing as a close partner of Solomon Islands to advocate for Solomon Islands' interests and bring pressure to bear on responsible entities,"" it continued. ""We will act, as appropriate, to minimise the impacts of the spill while ensuring we do not diminish in any way the fundamental obligations of responsible parties.""For Mr Singamoana, the companies had to step up: ""They have to do something about it, especially to the local people who own the reefs"".""They did it,"" he said.",4 Mar 2019

In Kangava Bay, the azure waters have been blackened by oil, the reef thick with sludge. Metres away, where the rich rainforest barrels down to the coast, the white sand gets coated by a heavy goop with each wave that rolls in. The air is thick with the stench of heavy chemicals, residents say.Each day for the past three weeks, locals have looked out to a giant ship, the MV Solomon Trader, as it sits wedged on a reef, a gash on its side leaking as much as 60 tonnes of oil into a marine sanctuary.The spill is still not contained, and experts have scrambled from as far away as Australia and the United States to try and stem the flow in what authorities now say could be the Solomon Islands' worst environmental disaster.As the Solomon Islands government confirmed it cannot cope with the scale of the leak, containment supplies are being flown from Australia.Efforts to refloat the ship, chartered by bauxite miner Bintan Mining Corporation, have been hampered by poor weather and Rennell's remoteness.Meanwhile, the spill could taint a Unesco world heritage area already threatened by climate change, mining and logging. And for locals, it's poisoning their food sources and livelihoods.Willie Kaitu'u, who hails from the Tehakatu'u tribe in Kangava Bay, said the beaches were covered with oil, the air was pungent, and fishing grounds that his people have long relied on ruined.""There's very black oil that's spread everywhere,"" he said via a crackly cellphone. ""The oil has started to go over and cover the beaches and also the deep sea. It's covered the protected area. There's a clear sign of worry,"" he said.The Hong Kong-flagged Solomon Trader had arrived in Rennell from the Chinese port city of Longkou to collect a load of bauxite, the main ore used in the production of aluminium, when it was washed onto the reef by Cyclone Oma, according to the ship's owners.Since 4 February, it's sat where it was grounded. Cyclone Oma lingered for more than a week, stirring heavy swells and preventing tugboats from attempting to salvage the ship, from where it's proved stubborn to remove.

The reef it sits on is part of a World Heritage Area, recognised by the United Nations as a global site of ecological significance that's already under threat. Rennell is the largest raised coral atoll in the world, and contains diverse and unmodified forests, coral and species.In a statement, Unesco said it was concerned about the spill and was ""working with the national authorities to ascertain the status of the situation and the best mitigation measures to be taken"".But it could still get worse, according to the premier of Rennell and Bellona province, Colin Singamoana.Initial reports by the Australian experts suggested about 60 tonnes of oil had already leaked from the ship. But more than 600 tonnes remained on board. The reef had been acting as a sort of plug, Mr Singamoana said, and if the ship shifted, the remaining oil could be unleashed much more quickly.Mr Singamoana said the currents had already started spreading oil down much of the Rennell coast, and he warned it could reach as far as the neighbouring island, Bellona.""The content of the oil on board is highly poisonous,"" Mr Singamoana said. ""We use the sea for most of our support, especially in terms of food.""A member of the Rennell community in the capital Honiara, Derek Pongi, said his relatives had told him that the oil had already poisoned their fishing grounds.""The people rely on the sea but now it's all contaminated and polluted,"" he said. ""Things are not looking good for my people.""Mr Pongi said people were growing increasingly frustrated with the pace of the response, and that anger was mounting particularly towards the bauxite miner, Bintan Mining Corporation (BMC).Many are asking why the company was loading bauxite when there were cyclone warnings for the entire country, and how there were so few safeguards in place in a world heritage area.The Solomon Islands government has described the spill as an emergency and has committed several agencies to the response. But word from Honiara has been muted, and disaster officials have said it doesn't have the capacity to cope.It's activated an agreement with Australia that has seen its Maritime Safety Authority committed to the response, and experts and equipment were deployed on a special military flight late last week. The Australian High Commission, in a statement, said it was exploring all options to contain the spill.The ship's owners, Hong Kong-based King Trader Ltd, said it had also sent a team to help with the salvage operations and was doing everything it could.But the bauxite miner, BMC, had a different response through its parent company. It published statements in local newspapers seeking to absolve itself of responsibility, critics claim, pushing it onto King Trader Ltd.""BMC, as the voyage charterer, have no legal responsibility … for the ship,"" the statement read. ""BMC is just using the ship to carry its good from the point of loading to the point of discharge.""""In the case of Solomon Trader, BMC as charterers of the ship, have no liability for this incident,"" it said, adding that the outlook for a successful operation was promising.That position met with frustration from Premier Singamoana.""To me I think the responsibility really in regard to that issue is the mining company.""Mr Singamoana said he planned to seek advice from the attorney general, while the Australian High Commissioner, Roderick Brazier, said Australia would help the Solomon Islands government to hold the company, owners and insurers to account for the damage.Meanwhile, oil's still leaking, and Mr Kaitu'u said the people of Kangava Bay were fearful about their food sources, their income and their environment.""It's not looking good,"" he lamented.

A tanker which became wedged on a reef off Rennell Island earlier this month has leaked as much as 60 tonnes of oil into a marine sanctuary.The bauxite miner which chartered the ship, Bintan Mining Corporation, is leading salvage efforts, which began on Sunday.Bintan's manager, Fred Teng, said a team is preparing to transfer oil off the ship.But he said efforts had been stalled by a power generator failure, which has put the cargo crane on-board out of order.Mr Teng said salvage equipment, including a generator, and 10 crew members are arriving in Honiara on Friday to assist.",28 Feb 2019

Having spread from its initial invasion site in Honiara, a new variant of the beetle is threatening copra and palm oil production and livelihoods of villagers who depend on coconuts.New Zealand research institute AgResearch Dr Trevor Jackson has been assisting Solomon Islanders respond to the problem.He said it was much worse than we anticipated when the pest was first noticed in the Pacific around 10 years ago.""We've seen areas where virtually all of the palms in an area have been destroyed by the beetle. So this has caused a total collapse in coconut production in those areas.""Dr Jackson said a virus previously released to bring the pest under control was no longer effective.He said until a new control was found, efforts to stop the spread of the pest were intensifying in the Solomons.

""What we saw before is if we can weaken the pest by introducing a biocontrol agent like the virus then it weakens the whole population and that effectively stops it spreading. Our problem at the moment is that we don't have an agent like that. So in the short-term the slogan in the Solomons is 'Cut, Burn and Kill'.""Dr Jackson said the slogan urged people to cut down infected palms, clean up the infected areas, and kill beetles as much as possible to counter breeding.This voracious variant of the common rhinoceros beetle was first recognised for its aggressive damage on the island of Guam and it has since been found in Hawaii, Papua New Guinea, and now on Solomon Islands.The beetle damages the palms by boring into the palm stem and feeding on the sap. Developing fronds in the growing point are damaged by the feeding and the plant will be seriously defoliated. Attacked heavily by the beetle, a palm will die.Previous invasions started in urban areas and spread to the surrounding countryside but the Solomon Islands invasion is the first time the beetle has spread into the productive agricultural environment.""Mature oil palm are being killed in the plantations as well as the young replant,"" said Dr Jackson.""In some areas there is almost total destruction of the coconut palms, much worse than our first predictions of 50% loss"".

According to him, previous prime minister Manasseh Sogavare's pursuit of the Papuan self-determination issue was part of his former role as chair of the Melanesian Spearhead Group.Mr Tozaka said bringing Indonesia and the United Liberation Movement for West Papua into the MSG was designed to get the two sides talking.He admitted it had been difficult.""It's not going to be something that we can solve within a very short time. It is a long term issue. And I think the referral of the matter to the United Nations, I think we have achieved that,"" he said.Representatives of seven Pacific Islands countries have spoken at the UN in recent years over their concern about human rights abuses in Papua or called for a new self-determination process for Papuans.But with Indonesia's government strengthening ties with some of these countries last year, the number of Pacific governments prepared to keep speaking out appears to be dwindling.Papua New Guinea's government supports the economic development approach that Jakarta is taking in Papua region as the best response to West Papuan discontent with Indonesian rule.PNG's Foreign Minister Rimbink Pato recently said the two countries had been planning and implementing joint projects in their common border areas.""Things are about to really take off as our constructive engagement policy picks up speed,"" Mr Pato said.Yet the MSG's full members - Solomon Islands, PNG, Fiji, Vanuatu and the FLNKS body of New Caledonia's Kanaks - have come to an impasse of sorts over West Papua.Vanuatu and the FLNKS want to advance West Papuan independence aspirations at the United Nations. PNG and Fiji are firmly opposed to this, recognising Indonesia's sovereign claim over Papua.Since late 2017 when Mr Sogavare was ousted, Solomon Islands had been hovering somewhere in the middle, amid uncertainty over where it stood.Some members of the government, including Mr Sogavare who is now deputy prime minster, remain deeply concerned about ongoing conflict in Papua. But the prime minister increasingly appears to have taken a departure on the policy.Mr Hou last month told local media that West Papua was a domestic issue for Indonesia to deal with alone.""We have to go through the normal channel of talking with the government of Indonesia, and I think that's Rick Hou's position,"" Mr Tozaka said.He insisted the current Solomons government concern for human rights in Papua was consistent with previous governments.""The self-determination issue is a matter that is very sensitive... it is a matter that... we have to go through diplomatic lines.""You cannot just say to them 'we want to have this, you have to do this'. We have to understand each other first,"" the minister explained.Mr Tozaka indicated his government regularly raised concerns about human rights abuses in Papua with Indonesia's government.

He said Rick Hou met with Indonesian president Joko Widodo during the APEC summit in Papua New Guinea in November.However, Mr Tozaka conceded he didn't think Papua was discussed between the two leaders.Meanwhile, he said that a report from a Solomon Islands delegation which visited Papua last year had still not been discussed by the government.The delegation, comprising of government and civil society representatives, visited Jayapura last April at the invitation of Indonesia's government.According to the head of the delegation, the government's official position on West Papua would be informed by the report resulting from the delegation's visit.",16 Jan 2019

Loti Yates, the director of the Solomon Islands Disaster Management Office, is used to dealing with floods. But even he's getting worried with what he has to deal with - and how often.""When I first come ... 15 years ago, we were dealing with floods only on the Guadalcanal plains around this time of year,"" he said. ""Very rarely you'd hear of flooding on other parts of the Solomon Islands.""But that's no longer the case. Much of his year can be consumed dealing with floods right across the archipelago, he said, in as many as eight provinces at once.That's exactly what he's dealing with right now. For two weeks, much of the country has been drenched by heavy rain that's caused flooding and landslides across the country. Two people have died and as many as 22,000 have had their homes or food crops destroyed, the office estimates.Many of those people were staying with relatives or sleeping in churches, he said.""When it comes to seeing the changes over the years - I can vouch for that. Things have just been getting worse and worse,"" said Mr Yates.In several provinces, rivers have burst their banks and swept through villages. Flood water has contaminated drinking water and destroyed crops. Strong winds blew off rooftops and flattened homes. Landslides have cut access to roads in some districts.
Weeks of unrelenting rain has unleashed floods across much of the Solomon Islands. Loti Yates says the rainy season is becoming increasingly so. 
Photo: The Island Sun
January has always been the rainy season in the Pacific, but the volume and frequency in which the region is being struck is alarming scientists and aid agencies, and adding significant pressure to the limited resources of the region's disaster offices.Since 2015, the Pacific has been hit by a category five cyclone -- the highest category possible, with minimum mean winds of 198km/h -- four times. Cyclone Liua, the first of this season, developed near Solomon Islands on 26 September, the earliest in recorded history.This past fortnight, the Solomon Islands has had to contend with three storms that have pelted the country in rapid succession. First, there was the tropical depression that slowly crossed the country, later turning into Cyclone Mona, which is now menacing Fiji. Then, another tropical depression formed nearby, and has been held over the country because it's sandwiched by Cyclone Penny to the south and another system to the west.That's brought two weeks of unrelenting rain, said Mr Yates.
There are currently three storms active in the Pacific right now.

""We haven't had a big cyclone since Tropical Cyclone Zoe in 2003,"" he said. ""But Solomon Islands doesn't need a cyclone to get severe flooding. What we go through, maybe two or three tropical depressions which have very high rainfall and consequently, there is huge flooding.""Mr Yates said one of the deaths was in Isabel Province, when a man died while trying to swim across a river to get home. Police confirmed another death when a boat with eight people on board capsized in the Marovo Lagoon in Seghe on New Year's Eve, three people from the boat are still missing.""We've been trying to warn people not to travel across the islands or rivers,"" said Mr Yates. ""It's unfortunate though that despite all these warnings people are still crossing islands on banana boats and risking everybody's lives.""Mr Yates said these figures were likely to change, as his office was yet to make contact with more remote areas. Thousands more could be affected, he warned.""We've had very little information coming in because of the continuing bad weather,"" explained Mr Yates. ""People couldn't travel and therefore only now in the last day or so, we are starting to receive people coming in or people have managed to get their cellphones working and are able to pass on information to us.""We are expecting this figure to increase because we haven't got anything from Temotu Province yet and we've heard very little from Makira Province.""

The effects of these floods are likely to linger for a long time, Mr Yates said. Eighty percent of rural communities rely on solar power for electricity. But such little sun has made charging cellphones problematic, restricting communication across the island.The Guadalcanal plains, which he described as the capital's food basket, had been inundated, with many crops washed out.""When you look at the amount of water running through and it has been inundated for five or six days in most cases, you will know that root crops, vegetables and everything that usually gets tracked into Honiara markets will be very less now.""Eighty-five percent of Solomon Islanders lived off subsistence farming, Mr Yates said, and the increasing frequency with which crops had been affected was hampering community life.""They only grow just enough to live on and any extras that these people plant in their lands, can be sold in markets and that would go to servicing other needs such as school fees and stationery for their kids,"" explained Mr Yates.""So that is what we are looking at here. We do not have the dole system where the government gives funds to people to help them every week. These are farmers who work their land just enough to eat and survive and whatever extras they can get out of their lands, they can sell in the markets. Now that's gone.""Fishermen, too, were struggling with not being able to go out for two weeks, as have the cocoa and cassava industries, two of the country's main drivers.Mr Yates said aid was urgently needed, and people were being told to boil their water before drinking it. The risk of water and mosquito-borne diseases had increased dramatically because of the floods, he said.""Many people don't have proper water systems. Communities use wells or streams so now their water systems will be gone. But the secondary impacts are health issues like diarrhoea and with too much water around, it is good nesting places for mosquitoes so increases the chances of having malaria and dengue outbreaks,"" Mr Yates said.
Hillsides have buckled in many areas as a result of two weeks of heavy rain.

""We need food and hygiene kits. Washing is a critical issue here. We need to get clean water, sanitation and hygiene because consequences of not dealing with this will have bigger consequences on the health, disease outbreaks.""This season has already been pretty bad for Solomon Islands, but for Mr Yates, it's becoming a new normal. While it's been more than a decade since the last significant cyclone, the country has been regularly ravaged by some kind of storm or floods.He said it's getting worse.""People are aware of the change. You sit down and listen to the elders in the communities and they'll tell you, 'Oh we used to be doing this here...and now these years, we can't.'""The land size is decreasing because of erosion over the last 20 years, and so you need to worry. There are more remote islands and our population is increasing.""And with the changing climate, he fears the country cannot prepare enough.""That is a concern for all of us, for the Disaster Management team, for the government, for everybody here. You need to start considering resettlement polices and maybe polices that will help decrease the ongoing issues of greenhouse gasses etc.""Not that countries like Solomon Islands contribute much to this.

The programme was developed in response to widespread consultations and research on access to justice in rural Solomon Islands, carried out by the World Bank with funding from Australia, in the aftermath of the violent ethnic conflict during the late nineties and early 2000s.A senior governance specialist at the bank, Virginia Horscroft, said they found communities felt they were unable to deal with a number of the challenges they were facing in terms of disputes, and there was a need for mediation.""And communities expressed a wish to both have some support in being able to strengthen their own mechanisms for resolving disputes and also to have a greater connection with the state,"" Virginia Horscroft said.The head of the Solomons' field research team, Ali Tuhanuku, said the Community Governance and Grievance Management Program aims to address both of these concerns by assisting provincial governments to train locally appointed community officers.""And the role of these officers one is to help them resolve conflict when they arise and refer serious matters to the police and two for them to be the channel for service providers such as education, health and others as their link into communities,"" said Ali Tuhanuku.

Measures to promote gender diverse workplaces include new ways to support employees affected by violence.The report looks at the first year of the Waka Mere Commitment to Action, a two-year initiative promoting gender equality in the private sector in Solomon Islands.It shows eight companies have now set targets for increasing the share of women in leadership positions and are investing in women through management courses.Nine out of 12 women who attended the courses were later promoted or given broader responsibilities.The report has been produced by International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, and the Solomon Islands Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Australian and New Zealand governments supported the report.Through Waka Mere, which means ""she works"" in pidgin, the 15 companies are working towards meeting at least one of three commitments: promote more women into leadership positions, build respectful and supportive workplaces, and increase opportunities for women in jobs traditionally held by men.""It's clear the private sector in Solomon Islands is starting to recognise the value to their business and staff of breaking down barriers to women's employment,"" said Milissa Day, IFC's Country Representative for Solomon Islands. ""There is definitely more to be done and we look forward to seeing participating companies reach their targets next year.""Eleven Waka Mere companies trained teams on how to respond to staff affected by violence and started implementing a policy for addressing domestic violence, as part of measures to build respectful and supportive workplaces. At the same time, more employers started to train women to take on traditionally male-dominated roles such as driving company vehicles.""We hope this is just the beginning and that the Waka Mere companies will inspire and set the example for others to follow,"" said Dennis Meone, CEO at SICCI.Prior to the start of the initiative, employee surveys and HR data from the companies showed women were underrepresented at all levels of the workforce, especially in leadership positions. While half the companies had policies on equal employment opportunity or non-discrimination, one third of employees reported that women and men did not have the same chances for promotion.Three quarters of all employees agreed that domestic violence was affecting people's ability to go to work or perform at work. One third of employees reported that they did not feel comfortable or safe at work. In Solomon Islands, only one in four private sector jobs are held by a woman and two out of three women experience domestic violence.Waka Mere companies include: Bank South Pacific, Bulk Shop, GPPOL, Hatanga Construction Ltd., Heritage Park, National Fisheries Development, Pan Oceanic Bank, Solomon Airlines, Solomon Brewery, Solomon Islands National Provident Fund, Solomon Islands Port Authority, Solomon Islands Tobacco Company Ltd, Solomon Islands Water Authority, Solomon Power, and SolTuna.",15 Oct 2018

UNICEF said six Pacific countries showed improvement in their rates over the past year with the others being Vanuatu, the Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Palau and Nauru.The agency's latest report into global child mortality said the improvements were due to better antenatal care, increased immunisation rates, more government health spending and more coordination among donors.UNICEF's Pacific Representative, Sheldon Yett said for the positive trend to continue there needed to be an even greater priority on improving access to health services, promotion of breast feeding, good nutrition, and access to clean water as well as basic sanitation.The agency estimated around the world 6.3 million children under 15 years of age died in 2017, or 1 every 5 seconds, mostly of preventable causes such as complications during birth, pneumonia, diarrhoea, neonatal sepsis and malaria.For children everywhere, the most risky period is the first month of life with 2.5 million babies dying during this time in 2017.The global number of children dying under five has fallen dramatically from 12.6 million in 1990 to 5.4 million in 2017.

This open letter is supported by a group of New Zealanders who have worked and those are who are still working in development in the Solomon Islands and condemns Ms du Plessis-Allan's remarks on Newstalk ZB as well as Newstalk ZB's implicit support.

History has shown that the dehumanisation of a group of people by referring to them as a class of non-human animals liberates aggression and has far-reaching consequences in enabling one group of people to hurt the other group. Well-known examples of this have been shown in the calling of Tutsi people as cockroaches, Bosniaks and Croatians as aliens, and Jews as rats and parasites. Journalism and broadcasting plays a crucial role in all countries as voices and opinions are distributed nation-wide, and so the spread of hatred should have no place in this process. National broadcasters should know better.Here in the Solomon Islands, we work alongside many hardworking people. We work across a range of sectors, including governance, justice, climate change, health, education, youth, tourism, infrastructure, and journalism. We work with people from the country leader level down to the staff out on the field. While of course no country is without bad people here and there, they are always outnumbered by the many good people who are dedicated to the development of the country. It would not be surprising to find that Solomon Islanders are vastly dedicated to their own development, equally if not more so, than those in New Zealand. We have no doubt that the Solomon Islands are not unique in the Pacific in this aspect. To paint entire countries and regions as hellholes and leeches is an insult to the good people working hard to make a change.

Finally, as there are many exemplary New Zealanders who have dedicated many years working across the Pacific Islands to help build capacity and strengthen institutions, it follows that the remarks belittle our efforts. To say that Pacific Islanders are leeching off us is a gross misunderstanding of the situation and undermines the credibility of the work of New Zealanders in the field. Foreign aid exists not simply as a charity, but it is well understood that helping our neighbours helps us in return. In turn, we have more trade partners, better prevention of epidemics, better regional and national security, improved international relations, and of course a better reputation for New Zealand. To say that the Pacific Islands don't matter shows a lack of understanding. The fraction of money that the New Zealand government spends here is well worth the returns we receive.We understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. We simply hope that the opinions are well-formed, evidence-based, and do not spread hatred due to gross generalisations and misinformation. However, while her comments have certainly not gone unnoticed here in the Solomon Islands, the general reaction from Solomon Islanders indicates an understanding that the unfortunate actions of a few individuals do not represent an entire nation, let alone an entire region. Solomon Islanders continue to hold New Zealand and New Zealanders in high regard and we New Zealanders working here are confident that this remains the case.On behalf of:Nid SatjipanonHoward LawryRosalind LawryKate HaugheyAnna O'KeefeSophie Lewis-SmithElisabeth DegremontJack ThompsonCraig HooperPip StevensonCatherine Hanson-FriendPatrick RoseNicole HerronJackie Cronin",20 Sep 2018

Tito Vodowaqa doubled Fiji's advantage nine minutes into the second spell after connecting with a low cross across the face of goal from Mohammed Naizal.Vanuatu, who finished runners-up to New Zealand at the last OFC Under 19 Championship, pegged a goal back in the 80th minute when a foul in the box allowed Jordy Tasip to convert from the penalty spot.But with only added time remaining Vanuatu conceded a penalty of their own at the other end of the field.Kishan Sami saw his first effort saved but kept his cool to slot home the follow up attempt which gave Fiji a 3-1 lead that they held until the final whistle.Head coach Bal Reddy said it was a well deserved victory.""That is basically what we are here for so these three points is a little bit of pressure released and the boys have really played their hearts out today,"" he said.""It's a sweet victory for us in terms of in the last two World Cup (qualifying tournament) Vanuatu defeated us so I think it's a good one for us.""

In the other Group B clash at Stade Fautaua in Papeete, Solomon Islands came from a goal down to beat New Caledonia 3-2.The French territory had five or six decent chances in the opening ten minutes but took until the 23rd minute to break the deadlock, when Cyril Drawilo converted from the penalty spot.Lino Houairia equalised four minutes from the interval after finding himself unmarked at the back post.In the 52nd minute New Caledonia goalkeeper Christopher Yeiwene was yellow carded as he punched the ball clear under pressure from Ali Mekawir who then left the field with a head injury.Patrick Taroga fired the resulting penalty past reserve keeper Une Kecine to put Solomon Islands 2-1 to the good, which became 3-1 20 minutes later, when Lucas Bituad's attempt at clearing a corner ended up in the back of his own net.

New Caledonia captain Cyril Drawilo cut the deficit the one with his second penalty goal of the match, following a handball but Solomon Islands held on for the remaining 15 minutes to secure an important first-up result.""To play against New Caledonia, for the Solomon Islands, is not easy,"" Solomons coach Batram Suri said.""It's always one wins, then the other wins and always by a close margin. So we expected that it would be tough today.""We came from behind, we were doing well and the boys really tried their guts out.

The Solomon Islands government led by prime minister Rick Hou has been applauded by people all over the country for taking these important forward steps in the fight against corruption.But the chairperson of parliament's Bills and Legislations Committee, Matthew Wale, said the new anti-corruption act is defective.The MP for Aoke Langa Langa has pointed to weak provisions on unjust enrichment and a clause allowing local custom or cultural practices to be used as a defence against corruption allegations.Mr Wale said all point to a lack of political will to take a zero tolerance approach to corruption.""The law is defective in a number of key areas however it is I think a giant leap forwards for Solomon Islands in terms of recognition of the problem of corruption and establishing mechanisms to substantively address it,"" Matthew Wale said.One of the contentious parts of the new law is clause six which implies that the act does not apply retrospectively.Matthew Wale says it is an unnecessary clause because this protection is already provided for in section 10(4) of the country's constitution.The chief executive of Transparency Solomon Islands, Ruth Liloqula, said relevant or not, it paints a bad picture.""The fact that it is in [the Act] portrays to the public that legislators have something to hide and that they are protecting themselves from being investigated. This is the interpretation for the public,"" he said.The Bills and Legislation Committee has made several recommendations for strengthening the anti-corruption law.One of them is for the commission, it seeks to set up, to be accorded more financial independence from government.The legal director of the office of the Ombudsman in Solomon Islands, Nelson Dhita, said this is an ongoing operational issue for his organisation.""For us we had requested additional funds and human resources but that was not given to us,"" he said.""There is an additional overarching obligation on the government to adequately resource this anti-corruption agency and its sister organisations in order for them to be fully effective as expected in undertaking there mandate in fighting corruption in all its forms and at all levels,"" he said.Nelson Dhita said his office also shares the concerns raised by others about the Act allowing traditional or cultural practices to be used as a defence against allegations of corruption particularly bribery.""A zero tolerance approach should be taken. No room should be given for an excuse premising on custom at least in corruption offences,"" Nelson Dhita said.Matthew Wale said the errant clauses in the new legislation reflect how politically divisive the legislation has been.""This bill has taken a number of years to get to the floor of parliament and even then the approval was more acquiescence because of the public pressure,"" he said.""Now that it is passed it is good to see it in practice. That it is implemented and with that I hope that there will be much more recognition in parliament that the law needs to be strengthened.""Among the committee's recommendations to achieve this is a call for the Act to provide more scope for investigating corruption in the private sector and suggestions that the commission be given powers to freeze funds and seize assets suspected of having been obtained corruptly.But Transparency's Ruth Liloqula said her organisations main focus is pushing for the Anti-Corruption Act and its sister legislation the Whistleblowers Protection Act to come into effect.The Whistleblowers Protection BIll 2016, passed on Tuesday, is designed to strengthen the Anti-corruption Act by protecting people who report corruption, maladministration or misconduct in the public and private sectors.""We are hoping that there will be investigations and that people will come forward to report what they see and provide evidence without having to be afraid that they are going to be losing their jobs ... or that they wont be protected,"" Ruth Liloqula said.According to the office of the Solomon Islands' Attorney General it is up to the prime minister Rick Hou to announce a commencement date for the new laws.In the meantime, there have been renewed calls for the government to also bring Freedom of Information legislation to parliament and further strengthen the new-found appetite to root out corruption in Solomon Islands.",2 Aug 2018

Why is it not producing the necessary classroom spaces? Why are we short of money for scholarships and the like?"" Rick Hou said.Mr Hou told the SIBC that the Solomon Islands' economy was expected to grow by three percent this year, which by global standards is quite healthy.But he said in Solomon Islands' context high inflation and population growth cancel out any potential growth benefits.""We are short of money for almost everything. So there has to be some way of addressing this,"" he said.The prime minister believes if Solomon Islands is to break out of a cycle of 'running on the spot' it needs to stop exporting raw materials and start processing them and also start investing more in agriculture and tourism.""We don't need to think of any other schemes. Just address these things. This is crops or products where every dollar you spend gets into the hands of rural households immediately.""This is good for income, it is good for development, good for foreign exchange, good for government revenue, good for the family, good for the economy, good for the country,"" Mr Hou said.

But the prime minister said the country's most important resource, its people, had lost sight of what it means to be a Solomon Islander, ""where everybody is not only willing but proud to serve their country"".""Do not think if you are a fisherman that you are not serving your country? Or if you are working in the garden planting your yams or your cassava don't think you are just doing that for your family. No you are serving this country by doing this activity. It is value. It is productivity. That is what we want,"" Mr Hou said.""And of course, that call of course comes to us decision makers it is really critical that we make those important decisions.""",2 Aug 2018

Solomon Islands police says they confiscated a West Papuan flag at the Melanesian Arts Festival to stop any provocation aimed at the Indonesian delegation.Ben Didiomea had his flag taken by police over the weekend after he held it up in front of Indonesia's festival stall to protest its inclusion at the event.A video on Facebook shows Mr Didiomea - who was part of a group of demonstrators - holding up West Papua's Morning Star flag as Indonesian officials tried to move him away from the stall.He was then approached by Solomon Islands Police who confiscated the flag.Mr Didiomea said he had been standing in solidarity with fellow Melanesian people of Indonesia's Papua region, where the Morning Star is banned.He said the Melanesian Arts Festival, which Honiara hosted over the last ten days, was not intended as an Asian festival.Police issued a statement saying the flag was removed to prevent provocation of the Indonesians, reminding the demonstrators that it was not a political event.Mr Didiomea, who along with two other demonstrators was questioned by police, said the inclusion of Indonesia at the Arts Festival was a political move by the Solomons government.""Because it was a festival of Melanesia, Indonesia is not part of Melanesia. So why does it need an Indonesia stall at the arts festival? It's a Melanesian festival, so what are Indonesia coming to arts festival?""According to Mr Didiomea, the police action was a sign that the country was forming a closer relationship with Indonesia.The Solomon Islands government under prime minister Rick Hou has recently shown signs that it was pursuing a different policy regarding West Papua to that of the previous prime minister Manasseh Sogavare.Mr Sogavare, who is now the deputy prime minister, campaigned internationally about West Papuan human rights issues. He was also supportive of the United Liberation Movement for West Papua, and instrumental in its admission to the Melanesian Spearhead Group in 2015.However after he was replaced by Mr Hou late last year, the Solomons government has been notably less vocal about West Papua human rights issues in international fora.A visit in April by a Solomons delegation to Indonesia's provinces of Papua and West Papua at the invitation of Jakarta was billed as having added ""balance"" to the government's view on West Papuan issues.The Solomons government told RNZ Pacific in May that it was consulting with the provinces as it formulated an official position on West Papuan human rights and self-determination issues.",9 Jul 2018

Negotiations for the use of land, previously used for the Festival of Pacific Arts in 2012, had been ongoing since early last year.The original site proposed for the stadium at Burns Creek near the eastern boundary of Honiara was abandoned due to difficulties evicting squatters from the land.It was important the new stadium was one that worked for the city and the country in the long-term and was sustainable, Minogue said.""What it will allow now is for the next stage, the actual design of the facility, to ramp up and get moving,"" he said.""During the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands was here and the Pacific Games Council have signed an updated Host City Agreement with him and NOCSI, the host Olympic Committee.""We did sign a contract when they won the Games in 2016 but we thought given that it's the first time they're hosting the games and being mindful of some of the issues we had around the 2019 event, switching out of Tonga,"" Minogue said.""For a country that's got to build a lot of facilities we thought we should put some additional milestones into the contract and we've all signed off on those... around the facilities construction is an important one but also things like the funding and establishment of the Games Organising Committee.""Making sure those structures are in place early enough so they can deliver the games... and I think having this land agreement for King George VI is going to go a long way to helping them meet the facilities deadlines we've put out for them.""",9 May 2018

Some say that these things happened previously, in the past,"" he explained.""So we have been collecting different views from them.

The delegation was led by Solomon Islands' Ambassador to Indonesia, Salana Kalu, and included the Solomons Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, John Teddie Usuramo, as well as a Special Secretary to the Prime Minister, Rence Sore.Five representatives from Solomon Islands' civil society were also part of the delegation, including a representative of the country's West Papua solidarity network.A spokesman for Indonesia's government said one of the objectives of the visit was for the delegation to see first-hand the development and situation in Indonesia, particularly in the provinces of Papua and West Papua.In Solomon Islands, the visit was barely publicised. But shortly before the delegation arrived in Papua, Indonesian media had reported on the visit, saying the Solomon Islanders had been invited by Wiranto, Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs.While the delegation was scheduled to meet with Papua's acting Governor inside the provincial government headquarters in downtown Jayapura, a small protest was held outside the building.Those demonstrating included students, activists and some staff from the secretariat of the United Liberation Movement for West Papua.A spokesman for the demonstrators said their public action was a way of questioning why the delegation came to Papua ""silently"", but also of conveying thanks to Solomon Islands for its support for West Papuan self-determination and human rights.
Nine West Papuans were arrested by Indonesian police outside Papua's government headquarters in Jayapura today

Jayapura police broke up the protest and took nine of those demonstrating away before they were able to have access to the Solomon Islanders. It's understood the nine were questioned and soon released.A brief statement from the Jayapura police chief suggested there was no significant incident outside the Governor's office, and appeared to deny that arrests had been made. Those staging the protest had reportedly not gained a permit to do so.Speaking from his home in the US, the vice-chairman of the Liberation Movement, Octo Mote, expressed disappointment that Honiara had not told them about the visit.""They didn't inform us at all, so I'm just predicting that one of the conditions of the visit from the Indonesian government was don't tell the Papuans,"" he said.Mr Mote said it would have been culturally appropriate for the Solomon Islanders to consult with representatives of the indigenous Papuans before they came to Papua.He said the Liberation Movement still felt its bid for an independent Papua had the support of Solomon Islands behind it.The government of Solomon Islands has been one of the most vocal on the world stage about human rights abuses in Papua region, widely known as West Papua.Until Rick Houenipwela recently replaced Manasseh Sogavare as the Solomons prime minister, the government had been championing moves to increase West Papuan representation in regional fora, notably the Melanesian Spearhead Group.Under Mr Sogavare's chairmanship of the MSG, the Liberation Movement in 2015 achieved observer status in the group.However Indonesia, whose government opposes the Liberation Movement, has controversially also been given a greater role in the MSG in recent years.

Even though Mr Sogavare remains influential as the Solomons deputy prime minister, the new leadership of Rick Houenipwela appears to be taking Solomon Islands on a different, more Jakarta-friendly approach to the Papua issue.Although recent data from Indonesia's National Violence Monitoring System showed Papua was the most violent province in Indonesia, the government of President Joko Widodo has embarked on a major infrastructure development drive in Papua which it says is transforming the region for the better.According to the Indonesian government spokesman, the Solomon Islands delegation would be discussing potential infrastructure development that Indonesia could assist with in the Solomons, particularly ahead of the upcoming Pacific Games.He said health sector cooperation was also up for discussion, in particular the need of Solomon Islands hospitals for medical equipment such as CT Scanners.The Solomons delegation was to be in Indonesia for a week. Its movements in Papua are being facilitated, at least in part, by Jakarta's Papuan envoys, Frans Albert Joku and Nicolas Messet.Former Papuan independence advocates, Mr Joku and Mr Messet both returned to Papua from exile around a decade ago and have been advocating for West Papuans to accept Indonesian rule.",25 Apr 2018

I knew it would happen there from a set piece,"" Allen said.""I know Osea (Vakatalesau) well, Brian (Kaltack) some of the other boys, I used to coach them before with Hekari and so I reminded my players what they can do.""Osea has good height, and he used it in the corner even though I warned them. The plan now is to go home, work on some things and prepare once more. We have a big chance to do something great at home next week.""Meanwhile, Team Wellington and Auckland City played out a goal-less first leg at Dave Farrington Park, with defending champions Auckland hosting the return leg at Kiwitea Street this weekend.

Work to rehabilitate the Parasi airfield in South Malaita was completed last month and a successful test flight was conducted over the weekend.Work to reopen the airfield began after the successfull brokering and signing of an agreement with landowners, according to a statement from the government.It credited the progress to an airport taskforce led by the ministry of communication and aviation which worked behind the scenes to get all parties to reach a consensus.The construction of a terminal building is the next step for the airport to prepare it for commercial flights expected to start by the middle of the year.The government said Parasi landowners had set a good example and it is calling on those involved in disputes that have closed two other airfields in the country at Manaoba and Lom lom to follow suit.",5 Apr 2018

Pacific Bauxite secured a prospecting license in 2016 with the support of some local landowners and obtained a provincial business licence, after a change in the local government, to begin working on Nende Island.But it has met with stiff opposition from other landowning groups who accused the company of operating illegally and are trying to take it to court.At the heart of the local protests against Pacific Bauxite is the fact that the area it's hoping to mine is among the most fertile farming land on the island of Nende.A member of the Temotu Provincial Assembly, Nelson Omar, said he told the miners as much in 2016 when he was the premier and his administration rejected their application for a provincial business licence.""You came without gun. Better you go back and you bring a gun, you shoot every people on the island and then you do your mining,"" Mr Omar told the miners.""Because it is in no way different from what will happen thereafter after you mine this place.""

After a change of provincial government, Pacific Bauxite was swiftly granted a provincial business license.That licence expires on the first of April.Just last week the latest protest by those opposing Pacific Bauxite took place at the office of the current provincial premier, David Maina, urging him not to renew the licence.Mr Maina said he listened to the protesters' views but condemned their actions as illegal.""They didn't follow the protocol they gave their letter less than 24 hours but by the law of this country any protest [notice] should be [given] 14 days through the police,"" David Maina said.Mr Maina said he is also considering pursuing legal action because he and his family also received death threats from anti-mining groups""We have to weigh these things properly, because already they have threatened where I come from the Reef Islands with threats and then my family itself. They used some words that are not fit or pleased to be heard. Like blood shed like this. So now I will try to find and file a court case for this,"" said David Maina.Nelson Omar said Mr Maina would do well to heed the groundswell of opposition to mining and reject any application to renew Pacific Bauxite's licence.""Once the premier doesn't listen to them. And he will grant a, renew the licence again then there will be bigger protests for him to resign his seat as a sitting premier of the province,"" warned Mr Omar.

One of the leaders of the main group of landowners opposing Pacific Bauxite, Ruddy Oti, said having the provincial business licence declined would be a small victory.Mr Oti said the real battle was trying to raise enough funds to challenge the legality of the miner's prospecting licence in court.He said his group had found a lawyer willing to take up their cause and raised $US1936 of the $US6,455 Solomon dollars needed to open a case.""We are looking at filing two cases. First one is injunction case. While we stop any prospecting activities we ask court to review the process in which the licence was obtained and that will be the second case,"" explained Ruddy Oti.

Pacific Bauxite's prospecting licence expires in December.But Mr Oti said company officials are meeting with pro-mining landowners in the capital Honiara this week to discuss applying for an actual mining licence.For the Temotu premier David Maina this would be a positive step.He said as one of the most remote provinces in Solomon Islands, Temotu could not afford to be picky with economic opportunity.Mr Maina said he wanted to mediate between those for and against mining Nende.""It will be fair if both parties come together and find a neutral zone that will take you together to discuss their issues. Because the government only caught in between the system,"" said David Maina.But Ruddy Oti said consultation should have been done before the company was granted a prospecting licence.""So that you have all these things in place before you have prospecting licence. As it is now the prospecting licence is now granted and so the whole process was flawed,"" said Ruddy Oti.""There is too much corruption in it. So what we want to do is just to stuff up the whole thing.""

He said Fiji's prime minister Frank Bainimarama breached MSG procedure by forcing the other four full members to accept Indonesia as part of the sub-regional grouping, whose full members are Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and FLNKS Kanaks movement of New Caledonia.Indonesia was admitted to the MSG with observer status in 2011 after Mr Bainimarama assumed the MSG's rotational chairmanship.""There was no consensus in the admission of Indonesia by member countries,"" claimed Mr Sogavare who wants Indonesian control of West Papua reviewed by the United Nations.In 2015 Indonesia had its status in the group elevated. This remains a complicating factor as the MSG wrestles with the sensitive issue of a West Papuan membership bid.However, in response, Fiji's Defence Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola, who often represents Fiji at MSG summits, denied Mr Sogavare's claim that the MSG didn't reach consensus on the issue.""I think he is either suffering from memory loss or trying to play politics with his own constituents,"" said Ratu Inoke.""He has forgotten that it was during his term as chair of the MSG when Indonesia was admitted to the MSG as an associate member. All members of the MSG had agreed.""

Mr Sogavare had chaired the 2015 meeting in Honiara where, according to Ratu Inoke, MSG leaders reached consensus about Indonesia's status in the group.""I cannot really understand why he is making this statement, trying to put the blame on our prime minister, because all the (MSG) members agreed to admit Indonesia as an associate member,"" said the Fiji minister.Following the 2015 summit, Mr Sogavare spoke of how bringing Indonesia into the fold had been polarising for MSG leaders.The United Liberation Movement for West Papua was itself granted observer status in the MSG in 2015, but its application for full membership continues to divide the five full members.At their latest summit in Port Moresby last month, MSG leaders approved new clarifications on guidelines around membership in the group.The Liberation Movement's application has been referred to the MSG secretariat for processing, but Fiji and Papua New Guinea have signalled they remain opposed to the pro-independence West Papuans being given full membership.Of the other full members of the group, Vanuatu and the FLNKS appear firmly in support of the Papuan bid.

Solomon Islands had until recently also been strongly in support of giving West Papuans full membership in the MSG.

After a win and a draw each, Team Wellington and AS Magenta are sitting on four points.Wellington coach Jose Figuera told OFC TV he wants his team to continue the form displayed in their last match, a 7-1 victory over Samoan club side Lupe Ole Soaga.""The plan for us doesn't change. We obviously want to come out and win the game,"" Figuera said.""Our objective was to finish top of the group and we know to do that we have to win to secure.""The most important factor will be our concentration and our organisation with the ball and without the ball,"" he said.Figuera said his team knows AS Magenta well.""We faced them last year in the semi-final. They are a strong team, very physical and aggressive and lots of speed so they have many dangers.""We have to make sure we are ready for all of their weapons but more importantly we have to make sure we are at the top of our game as well,"" he said.Solomon Island side Marist FC play Lupe after their match, with the former strong favourites and a chance to advance with a win.

AS Magenta coach Alain Moizan said the equation for the group is simple.""If we win, we qualify and Wellington most likely [will be] eliminated because Marist will win over Lupe.""For us that means there is no alternative but to win this match. It won't be easy because obviously Wellington is also more or less in the same situation.""Moizan said Wellington could get through with a draw but Magenta's best approach is to go out and try and win.Marist coach Jerry Allen has a similar mindset ahead of his match.Allen said his team is looking to score plenty of goals.""We score probably five goals it would help us to qualify,"" he said.""Lupe, they don't have any pressure with them but I believe that they will give us a good game.""The plan is that we must get maximum points,"" Allen said.Lupe are winless and their coach Paul Ualesi doesn't expect the task to get any easier against Marist FC.""It's a really hard one because Marist will try their best to qualify for the second round but we will try our very best.""""It's a home game [for them]. A lot of people, so it's big pressure for our boys but we are going to continue to fight the Marist team. We need to finish on a high note.""

The 29 men were apprehended at sea last week travelling in three boats.Police said the men were armed and on their way to the Western Provincial capital Gizo to seek compensation for the death of a relative earlier this month.The police feared trouble if their demands for compensation were not met.The men escaped from police custody on Wednesday last week after being suspected of entering the country illegally.By Saturday, nine of the men had turned themselves in.Police said they had been interviewed and processed by police and immigration officers and escorted back over the Solomon Islands-Papua New Guinea border.Because of close family ties between Papua New Guinea's Bougainville and the Solomons' Shortland Islands, communities there are allowed to travel freely between the two regions.There has been criticism that the arrests were insensitive and might have repercussions for Solomon Islanders living in or travelling to Bougainville.The Solomon Islands Police Commissioner Matthew Varley said such fears were unfounded and clarified that the special customary travel zone between Bougainville and Western Province only applied to the Shortland Islands.There was no automatic immigration approval for foreign citizens to travel beyond the Shortland Islands, he said.The police chief said throughout the operation Solomon Islands police were in daily contact with their counterparts on Bougainville.He called on communities on both sides of the border to respect the laws of both countries.Solomon Islands police said they would continue to maintain a high visibility presence in Gizo and surrounding islands over the coming days.They will also continue to investigate the lapse in security which led to the escape of the men from Gizo Police Station on the morning of February 21.Police are also warning anyone assisting the 20 Bougainvilleans still at large that it is unlawful to harbour and assist anyone who has escaped from custody.",26 Feb 2018

The Australian company which is being supported by the provincial government has met with growing opposition from the resource owning communities in West Nende.A mining advisor for the Temotu Conservation and Sustainable Development Association said that recently in the provincial capital Lata he witnessed the company's representatives being forced by angry landowners to get back on to a plane after they had just landed and fly back to Honiara.Ruddy Oti said communities across Temotu were working together to try and raise around $US6,456 or $SBD50,000 to engage a lawyer to challenge the legality of Pacific Bauxite's prospecting licence.""We appoint certain people to look after donations from each community. The cost involved to challenge a mining company in the court of law it is very expensive. The people of Nende even though this issue is very complex I think the people of Nende are united and patriotic to pursue this,"" said Ruddy Oti.

It was third time unlucky for Manasseh Sogavare on Monday night as he was ousted as the Solomon Islands prime minister in a vote of no confidence.Mr Sogavare's third stint as prime minister was his longest, and he came tantalisingly close to that elusive goal in Solomon Island politics: a full term in office.However, 10-months out from elections he was politically wounded by recent defections by almost half his cabinet, and narrowly defeated by 27 votes to 23.The vote followed six hours of arduous debate in parliament, kicked off by opposition MP Derek Sikua, who explained his reasons for moving the motion.Dr Sikua said MPs had lost confidence in Mr Sogavare because he wasn't listening to them any more and had become suspicious of anyone differing from his point of view.""Once he is fixated on a conspiracy his judgement ... inevitably becomes subjective to it,"" he told parliament. ""My greatest sadness is that all too often, the prime minister sees it fit to lower himself to submit to advice from individuals with dubious character.""But the communications minister and Sogavare supporter Peter Shanel rejected claims that Mr Sogavare hadn't been consulting with members of cabinet.He accused the ministers who defected of trying to hold the government to ransom over a personal grudge with the prime minister.

""Nothing is wrong with the policies we have,"" insisted Mr Shanel. ""Nothing is wrong with the policies that government implemented. Nothing is wrong with the work programme we brought in. In fact, we have good programmes.""Mr Shanel and other supporters urged MPs to let the prime minister finish the final ten months of his four-year term in office.But the East Honiara MP, Douglas Ete, said time had run out for Mr Sogavare. Citing shortfalls in health, education and general development around the country, he said they had no option but to support the motion.""Ten months is too much time, [it's] enough time to destroy this nation. So my question is what has the government done?,"" asked Mr Ete. ""We all must take the blame for it ... we have to go back to the drawing table and rewrite it.""In the end a slim majority of MPs voted to remove Mr Sogavare.

The vote brought around another prime minister's downfall in yet another no confidence vote. Since independence in 1975, only one prime minister has managed to serve a full term in office.For Mr Sogavare, Monday marked the end of his longest term as prime minister.His first term was in 2000, when he was installed as prime minister after Bartholomew Ulufa'alu was captured by rebels and forced to resign in an effective coup at the height of the country's ethnic conflict. However, his party failed to gain any traction in elections the following year.His second stint came in 2006, when Snyder Rini was forced to resign after riots in Honiara. This time, his term was in the middle of the Australia-led RAMSI intervention, of which he -- at the time -- was a critic. Mr Sogavare expelled the Australian High Commissioner and engaged in a public spat with the Australian government. He was eventually defeated in a no-confidence motion in December 2007.Mr Sogavare started his latest term after the 2014 elections, when he promised to revive the country's economy and work to eradicate corruption.

Mr Sogavare was toppled yesterday, losing a vote of no confidence in the 50 seat parliament by 27 to 23.The MPs who voted for the ouster included a number who had been in Mr Sogavare's cabinet until only recently.The MPs have denied it was over the anti-corruption bill, but Ruth Liloqula said her organisation and the Solomon Islands general public thought otherwise.""When they actually tabled the motion of no confidence and all the justification for that it does not ring true for anybody. It was shallow and the counting of numbers to pass the motion of no confidence, and I don't think we are impressed with what's going on.""Meanwhile, police in Solomon Islands have appealed for people to remain calm in the wake of the toppling of Mr Sogavare.

The former Central Bank governor was today elected by parliament 33 votes to 16 over the other candidate, Central Honiara MP John Moffat Fugui.Speaking to the parliament, Mr Hou said he would continue with the policies of the government of Manasseh Sogavare, who was ousted in a vote of no-confidence last week.""One of our immediate tasks is to identify clinics around the country that have been forced to close down, with ther view to reopening them. It goes without saying that it is the responsibility of the government to provide basic health services and indeed all other basic services to its citizens, especially in the rural areas.""Rick Hou said another important objective of his new government was to stabilise the country's ""ailing fiscal situation"".""It is my government's priority to immediately address the cash flow situation. My government will ensure there is fiscal displine across all government sectors and to assist line ministries to execute their respective budgets more efficiently, effectively and responsibly.""The Small Malaita MP said he recognised the public demand for advancement of the anti-corruption bill that the Sogavare government recently tabled.""Corruption has caused inefficiencies in operations, it has undermined public trust in government, and it has exhausted public resources and money as well as causing injustice through advantaging a few at the expense of many,"" said Mr Hou.""It has robbed vital resources from our schools and hospitals.

Nine ministers, including Deputy Prime Minister Manasseh Maelanga, tendered their resignation at the weekend, while a number of backbenchers have announced that they too are leaving the government.Among the defectors are former prime ministers Danny Phillip and Snyder Rini, lending weight to moves to change government. The group is basing its lobbying at the Honiara Hotel, and has been joined by a number of government backbenchers.As lobbying among MPs gets into full swing, the Honiara Hotel group is claiming a majority of MPs in the 50-seat parliament. It plans to oust Mr Sogavare in a vote of no-confidence next week.The defecting ministers claim the current government, the Democratic Coalition for Change, has lost trust in the leadership of Mr Sogavare. There are also grumblings about the influence of Mr Sogavare's nephew, Robson Djokovic, as cabinet's chief of staff.Mr Rini, the former Fisheries Minister, said he and the others resigned because the prime minister had stopped listening to others, and had been straying from core government policy of governance and sectoral reforms.""He changed his approach. He was diverting from our main policies, and he has listened too much to the outsiders, instead of listening to us ministers. So that's why I don't have any confidence with him, and why I resigned.""

But the Minister of Infrastructure Development, Stanley Sofu, said it was not entirely clear why the members resigned, suggesting there was more to it than Mr Rini was letting on.""We are trying to find out what are the reasons that made them resign from the government. I think it's something to do with the anti-corruption bill. I am still with the government, and I am committed to the anti-corruption bill.""The anti-corruption bill, a revised version of earlier legislation that Mr Sogavare's government controversially withdrew, was tabled for its first reading yesterday. It will still have to go through parliament's Bills and Legislation Committee for consideration before MPs can debate it in parliament.The jilted history of this legislation, including the modifications it has already undergone, underlines how a number of MPs remain uneasy about the legislation.According to another former prime minister, and the leader of parliament's group of independent MPs, Derek Sikua, the bill could yet be delayed again.He said some MPs fear that the passing of the bill will entail a jail term for them, since their names were already with police for investigation for corruption allegations.

Snyder Rini denied that he had any problem with the anti-corruption bill. He also dismissed any suggestion that Mr Sogavare should be given another chance, given the prime minister was only a year out from completing his first full four-year term in office.""I've given him a lot of chances,"" said Mr Rini.""In 2016, there were other members of our government that ran away, and I kept on supporting him. And then we got the number. So we gave him a chance, but he's not taking that chance very seriously, and is just listening to his cronies, and his nephew.""The Communications Minister Peter Shanel is another MP who has pledged his support to Mr Sogavare. He also claimed that those who resigned did not like the government's intention to pass the anti-corruption bill.Mr Shanel named Mr Rini and Mr Phillip as two central figures, accusing them of using personal grudges against Mr Sogavare and his nephew to hold government to ransom.Robson Djokovic was described by Mr Shanel as the driver of government reform programmes.""It did not go well with some of the ministers because they don't like to be pushed,"" said Mr Shanel. ""Things here in Solomon Islands are slow, but as government we can't have a slow government in providing services to the public.""He was outwardly confident that Mr Sogavare would have majority support in the 50-seat parliament come next week's vote of no-confidence.""The government has 24 at the moment. I believe the other side has at least 26. There are in some quarters people who misled each other. So we are looking at those who we can get back to government before the weekend.""

Manasseh Sogavare has urged people to heed advice from national disaster authorities and not to spread rumours that could cause panic.Authorities said the Tinakula volcano was undergoing a category three moderate eruption that poses minimal threat to nearby islands.The major concern was the impact of ash from the volcano on communities downwind of Tinakula in the Reef Islands where there are reports water supplies have already been contaminated.An aviation warning has also been issued for the Santa Cruz Islands.The director of the National Disaster Management Office Loti Yates said there was no way of telling how long the eruption event will continue but they are closely monitoring the volcano's activity.A school teacher on one of the islands affected by ash from the erupting volcano says uncertainty was causing a lot of anxiety in his community.Teacher on Fenualoa, Matthew Matoko, said the ashfall had stopped but it has contaminated a lot of the wells and water tanks on the island.Mr Matoko said the shortage of safe-drinking water on Fenualoa and the nearby islands was the most immediate problem but he says the lack of accurate information is also an issue.""They are worried what will happen next besides the water.

A statement from the prime minister's office confirmed today that the Minister of Mines David Dei Pacha and the Infrastructure Minister Jimmy Lusibaea had been sacked although it indicated that reports in local media that the Minister of Environment Samuel Manetoali had also been sacked were wrong.The sacking is accompanied by a major cabinet reshuffle which sees the mines portfolio taken up by government back bencher Bradley Tovosia while the Ministry of Fisheries will be filled by Stanley Sofu who is being moved from the Ministry of Police.Mr Sofu's former portfolio is being taken up by the former Lands Minister Moses Garu who is replaced by backbencher Andrew Manepora'a who has been called up to ministerial duties for the lands portfolio.Other changes see the Minister of Commerce Elijah Doromuala swapping with his colleague Bradford Marau who headed the Ministry of Justice.And finally the Education Minister Moffat Fugui also switches places with the Minister for Public Service John Dean Kuku.The government statement said the reshuffle was because some ministries had been underperforming and the Prime Minister wanted to improve efficiency to make the most of the last year of his government's tenure.However government sources say the sacking of Mr Lusibaea and Mr Dei Pacha were related to allegations of corruption.The stability of Manasseh Sogavare's government will also be a concern depending on what kind of weight the sacked ministers carry with other government MPs.1.

According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, as of last month, Solomon Islands had the sixth worst representation of women in parliament in the world.The country, which celebrates 39 years of democracy this Friday, has had only three women in parliament since gaining independence from Britain in 1978.Since 2008 women's rights advocates in the country have been pushing for 10 reserve seats for women, one for each of the 9 provinces and one for the capital Honiara.Two consecutive governments promised and failed to create reserve seats for women and the current government proposed temporary special measures to trial reserve seats for women over five years.But Mrs Soriocomua, who secured her seat in an open election running against in one of Solomon Islands' most traditionally patrilineal electorates, said while she understood the logic behind the move, she didn't believe it would help local women advance gender equality in the country.""I'm not agree with the idea of just giving them the reserve seats to walk in. You must be elected in a proper procedure. So that when you speak out or become a legislature people want to listen to you. It's not fair for our men, you have to fight to get the chair in a proper way.""Mrs Soriocomua also said culture needed to be kept separate from democracy if women were to progress as leaders in the country.She said she was only able to do so because her aspirations for democratic leadership were completely separate from the cultural leadership roles of local chiefs.""I have to respect them, I have to go right down, sit down with them, in our own culture, not bringing the democratic and culture together, you can not do that. You have to respect them, let them always be up there, and you sit down like you are the one who brings message to them, and you bring back the message to the the government, and this is how we should work.""Solomon Islands has the sixth worst representation of women in parliament in the world.Cultural barriers to women's participation in leadership in Solomon Islands are well documented in research by regional academics and experts and international human development organisations.",5 Jul 2017

At the final meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum's Enhanced Consultative Mechanism RAMSI was described as a perfect illustration of what can be done when applying Pacific solutions to Pacific problems.The meeting heard much had been achieved over the life of the mission with the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force now ready to assume full policing and security responsibilities.In a press release the Police Force was recognised as one of the most highly trained in the region, with the recent deployment of its members to participate in the United Nations Mission in Darfur illustrating its international standing.The ECM noted RAMSI had completed its mission to restore law and order, stabilise, re-set and strengthen national institutions, rebuild business confidence, enable employment opportunities, and restore essential services.",28 Jun 2017

A Solomon Islands conservation group says it's planning legal action against the government over mining plans in the remote Temotu province.An Australian company, Pacific Bauxite, secured a licence to prospect Santa Cruz island, and it claimed it had the consent of several landowner groups.But the Temotu Conservation and Sustainable Development Association said those groups didn't realise the implications of what might happen, and many were now trying to withdraw their consent.The Association's chair, Father Charles Melinga, said the provincial and national governments had done nothing to address their concerns.He said the groups believed the law was not followed when the prospecting licence was granted, and they were hoping to challenge it in court.Father Melinga said he hoped the process could begin soon.""As far as mining is concerned at the moment, the population is in suspense as to what will happen next.

Those promises came amid the rush of sympathy that followed devastating floods in Honiara in May 2014. The Mataniko River burst its banks following weeks of torrential rain, spilling into the Kwa village and destroying everything. 21 people died and hundreds were left homeless.

The Kwa village was condemned, and the government offered the displaced people land here in April Valley, in the rolling hills above the city's east. It also promised to help them build new homes and restore basic utilities, such as water and power.""In terms of the land, I am happy with what the government has done,"" said Michael Fa'abona, the chairman of the community. However, he said none of the other promises had come to fruition, and his people feel forgotten.""Because we live as citizens of this country ... we see the government as our father,"" he said. ""So I feel the government should recognise us and think of us and help us with the things they have already promised.""

On a tour along the village's boggy footpaths, Mr Fa'abona said much of the community was still living in tents that had become weathered and torn. Those who had houses, he said, had built them themselves by cobbling together timber and roofing iron.When the decision was made to relocate the approximately 100 villagers here, the Ministry of Lands promised that each family would be given - at no cost - land titles with 75 year leases. A ""blessing from almighty God,"" the ministry said. But that blessing never came.

""Our biggest problems are access to water and health clinics,"" said Brenda Ketea. ""We use wells and it is quite hard work pulling up water and our wells are not that hygenic. [But] we use these to do our washing and we even drink and bathe from them as well.""Because of the dirty wells, some children had fallen severely ill or died. When they did get sick, the nearest medical clinic was miles away, and most of the journey could only be made on foot.What happened in Honiara on 2 April, 2014, when the muddy torrent swept through Kwa village, is still a sensitive topic for the community and John Maelikiei, a youth leader, said many still had trouble coping.""Some of us have lost our fathers ... some of the young ones running around are still children and don't have mothers,"" he said. ""We see those children struggling and we worry for them - they have lost their help in the community and we look out for them.""

Many of the settlement's young people did not go to school, he said. The nearest one was miles away, and most parents could not afford to pay fees. Another young man, Kevin Ketoi, said many of the villagers had very low self-esteem.""I think if we had something like joinery of something it would be best for us youths here to preoccupy ourselves with and making things and get some sort of an income,"" he said.Above the village, at the peak of a hill overlooking the green, palm-fringed valley, the community had built a church from timber, plywood, tarpaulin and an iron rope, tied down by string.They called it St John's, after their old church, whose solid brick-and-mortar stood no match for the river's fury.

One man said the Archbishop of Melanesia had visited the site the weekend before for All Saints Day celebrations. When asked what the Archbishop had thought of their living conditions, the man laughed. He said he commented that it was a nice piece of land.Beside the church sat a concrete monument the community had erected as a memorial, which sat beneath a tattered Solomon Islands flag that fluttered defiantly in the wind. Every year, on 3 April, the community gathered here to hold a memorial service.""We always remember them ... That is why we made this monument,"" said Mr Fa'abona. ""And we have hoisted the Solomon Islands' flag to show that this is the place that the government gave us victims.""

But apart from the land, the government had given this community little else.The lands minister, Moses Garu, did not agree to an interview. But in brief comments outside parliament, he said he was aware of the problems faced by the people at April Valley and his ministry was still working on getting water and power to the settlement.But he said other issues relating to land tenure were more complex, and authorities had encoutered issues including people who were not flood victims moving onto the allocated land.Mr Garu said the ministry's permanent secretary, Stanley Waleanisia, would be the better person to speak to. Mr Waleanisia is yet to respond to requests for comment.

1255,https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/331639/frustrations-over-mining-coming-to-a-head-in-temotu,"Given the anger among the local community about bauxite mining, the conversation was remarkably cordial.""There is good mining, and there is bad mining, and I've witnessed a lot of bad mining,"" said the Australian man to the villagers of Noipe in Solomon Islands' Temotu province.He stood at a roadblock near their village, speaking to a handful of local adults, a teacher and a couple of dozens kids from Noipe's primary school.""We work really hard with the community,"" said the man, ""we have agreements with communities for good mining. We do everything we can to protect the land, the villages, the people.""We provide education for the children, we provide training for the adults. Can I show you some photos?"" he said, turning to get something from his nearby vehicle.""Excuse me,"" responded the teacher, ""we don't need photos, we don't need mining and we don't need prospecting, that's all. Our land is our heritage, our future for young generations.""""Okay, alright, thank you very much"" said the Australian politely, before leaving.The villagers posted a video of the exchange, saying they did not agree with mining prospecting proceeding on their land.The Australian man in the video is Mark Gwynne, the executive chairman of Pacific Bauxite.This Australian company owns 50 percent of AU Capital Mining, the entity which in 2015 won a license to prospect for bauxite at Nende in Temotu.Temotu is the most remote of Solomon Islands' provinces. Ships only general visit once a fortnight, and the twice weekly scheduled flights from Honiara are often cancelled as there's little money to have the grass on Temotu's airstrip cut.Yet there was a hotly anticipated visit to Temotu this month by Gwynne and company.Pacific Bauxite, formerly named Iron Mountain Mining, has come in for increased criticism in Temotu over the way it gained a business licence to conduct its prospecting at Nende.The license was granted soon after the Temotu provincial assembly voted in a new premier, David Maina, to replace Nelson Omar in late March.Shortly in advance of this, there was a flurry of activity on the Australian stock exchange as people bought up shares in Pacific Bauxite.Omar said the basis for moves to oust him was to approve the business license.""(But) the consent from the resource owners, the land owners, how it was conducted, was not done in accordance with existing legislations which govern the mining and logging acts,"" he explained.

On its website, Pacific Bauxite insists it has consulted with locals.""The Company is extensively engaged with the local community and is ensuring that all stakeholders are made fully aware of current and future activities regarding the Project.""But its assertion that ""meetings held with local parties to date have been extremely positive, and much enthusiasm has been generated by the recent phase of exploration"" contradicts comments from the local communities themselves.In reality, there's a groundswell of concern about the mining among the community on Temotu's main island of Nende (Santa Cruz).The concern stems partly from local people feeling they weren't adequately consulted in advance about the prospecting by either the company or government.It's also about fear of the potential environmental impacts of mining.Grace Kava, who is from the west side of Temotu's capital Lata, said most locals did not approve of bauxite mining due to fear it would devastate the soil.""Because they already knew something like the bauxite mining up in Rennell (Rennell and Bellona) province up the road, getting into a big disaster. They think the same thing will happen to them.""Ben Menivi, who is from Graciosa Bay, said mining posed a big threat to the water source from which the community gets much of its drinking water.""So that's my concern, that if the bauxite continues, they come and continue the work, they might destroy some of the top soils at the top of the mountain where the water source comes from.""

Another local, Henry Kapu, explained that because Temotu was prone to natural disasters and sea level rise, people from smaller islands in the group flocked to Nende, the province's main island, when they needed support, for food or other materials.This support system, he explained, would be at stake once bauxite mining had disrupted then island.""We will lose all our arable land, crops, ancestral land boundaries and this will further exacerbate land disputes,"" he said, warning that this could lead to more ethnic tensions in Solomon Islands, the type which brought the country to its knees at the turn of the century.The Temotu provincial executive is firmly supportive of the project.A provincial minister and former Temotu Premier, Father Brown Beu said they had considered the environmental impacts, and had consulted with landowners who he said were largely in favour.""The people who are against this prospecting are all working class, and they're all in town (Honiara),"" said Beu.""They should be assisting in some form, but they are not. Let me tell you that these people, as far as we in Temotu are concerned, we're not listening to them, full stop.""He claimed that as a remote and under-developed province, Temotu needed the kind of investment the bauxite project would bring.""Unlike other investors who are invested in Temotu Province, they (the mining company) will shortly after this be able to provide medical facilities that we will never - I don't know, centuries to come - never have.""Isn't that something that's worth looking forward to?"" he said.

Beu's characterisation of those against mining as outsiders sparked an outpouring of frustration on Facebook.""BB is our past parliamentarian. He says we are backwards in terms of development. Has he done any thing better for our province since his leadership to date?"" commented one Temotu man, Desmond Nimepo.When several personnel from the mining company turned up to Temotu in the past week, roadblocks were mounted by landowners to stop them moving around.Beu, who confirmed the miners were under police protection while in Lata, has been criticised by a former governor general of Solomon Islands.Sir John Ini Lapli, speaking on behalf of Nende people, said Beu's comments were way off the mark, and that the provincial executive had not taken the impacts of mining into account.According to Sir John, the issue had created tension in Temotu.He indicated that the upper levels of government and the ministry of mines were essentially likely to proceed with the mining, no matter how people felt.""You know they said in this law that certain feet below the ground, it is not people's land, it is government's. So that is where the government is sort of proceeding with this.""They came with some agent unknown, they didn't come through the procedure, and so they were able to pay some people to sign, accepting this proposal they signed up, and that is how they locked these landowners,"" said Sir John.

The provincial government's involvement in this process echoes the murky experience around logging operations on Temotu's Vanikoro Island.These operations, which have proved deeply divisive among the local community, are run by a Malaysian company, Galego Logging, whose local partner is Vanikoro Lumber Limited.Sometimes it extends to bribing people without explaining to people what they're asked to do Father Colton MedobuVLL's chief executive is Temotu's deputy premier, Ezekiel Tamoa.According to a Vanikoro native, Edward Pae, Tamoa promised that the developer would come and build infrastructure like roads, clinics, wharves, even an airstrip.""But up to now, they only cleared the land... There's totally no infrastructure developments on the land at the moment,"" Pae said.""After five years, there's a lot of environmental damages done: rivers crossed, tabu sites illegally entered, and most of the water sources that villages or communities around Vanikoro used to use have been badly damaged. And now the people on the ground in Vanikoro are really affected.""Tamoa denied there was any conflict of interest in him being the head of a company which got a license to log from the government he is part of.""Overall I think most of the landowners are okay with these developments. They stand to benefit from it.""

Tamoa disputed claims that in Vainkoro there had been no benefits from the logging, saying an airstrip and roads were being developed.He insisted that only a few locals had reservations about logging, but opposition to the project has already boiled over into unrest last year in the form of sabtoage of logging machinery, and has the potential to do so again.Numerous moves are afoot to press the provincial government to halt bauxite mining activities, including a public petition.Furthermore, a paralegal officer and concerned landowner, Ruddy Oti, has been collecting affidavits signed by Nende landowners who feel they were misled by the mining company when it sought to get landowner consent.Oti said that earlier, some individual landowners had been approached by the company and gave their consent.""After Oceans Watch (environmental NGO) did some awareness in Nende, there was some sense of realisation among these landowners who had previously given their consent, then they eventually agreed to have their consent revoked.""A Nende local and ranger for Oceans Watch, Titus Godfrey, said developers who came to Temotu tended to know some local people were interested in quick gains.""I mean, people gave their signature because the guy who came, he came in December, when he came in at Lata they said if you want to survey our places to do the drilling you can pay two hundred dollars or something like that.""

It's a theme echoed by Father Colton Medobu, an Anglican priest in Noole village.""The situation like here is people wait for opportunities of money: money, money, money... And when people talk about these things, people resort to advances of big money. That's why these people get caught up and use this as the basis for working with the people. And sometimes it extends to bribing people without explaining to people what they're asked to do.""He said that local people wanted development and were not strictly against resource extractive operators.But he said there had to be proper consultation and a proper strategy to avoid potential displacement and negative health and environmental consequences from these developments.While the provincial government appears unlikely to answer the petition's call to revoke the mining company's business license, it is under increasing pressure to respond to the community's concerns.Yet Brown Beu said that until the prospecting finished, it was premature to stop the project.""Then, we'll be able to ascertain as to whether there is enough minerals in the soil for mining later on,"" he explained.""And that of course depends on the people. Once the reports have come out and the people basically 'no we don't want mining' then that's it, it's finished.""This may not be the case - once a Surface Access Agreement is signed, there are few ways to stop the mining other than through the courts at the Development Consent stage.However, out of the current venting on Temotu has come an elevated level of public discourse about mining and logging.Raising awareness about these areas was the aim of NGO Oceans Watch.The co-director of Oceans Watch Solomon Islands, Chris Bone, said there had been a lack of awareness about not only the impacts of logging and mining, but also about what the better options were.Of those options, eco-tourism is an area that Temotu has huge potential in.""The place is absolutely gorgeous. It's a very, very special and very treasured place, and one of the last places in the Pacific that has this wonderful primary rainforest,"" he explained.

Oceans Watch has been raising awareness in the remote province about potential impacts from bauxite mining and logging developments currently afoot.The Temotu government said the resource projects would bring sorely-needed development to the province.But the co-director of Oceans Watch Solomon Islands, Chris Bone, said in the case of logging, local people would earn a pittance from their trees due to transfer pricing and middle men.""They can make quite a lot more money from their forests, with sustainable development, than they can from logging and mining. So we are working hard to inform people about for example about the REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) Plus scheme for carbon trading. They can earn more money for just protecting their environment and signing it for a carbon-trading scheme, than from logging,"" said Chris Bone.In the case of bauxite mining, which is at the prospecting stage in Temotu, it would take a long time to rehabilitate the island of Nende from the ravages of mining.

""The land is the basis of food and water sources for most local people, something that the groundswell of local opponents to mining fear will be jeopardised by the bauxite project,"" Mr Bone explained.Oceans Watch had also sent people to Rennell Island in the neighbouring province of Rennell and Bellona to examine the impact of bauxite mining.""And they have looked at the bauxite mining there and the topography and the geography.

But Mr Tozaka said they also told him the biggest issue with hiring them was the cost of airfares from Solomon Islands which are almost double that of the other Pacific countries involved in the RSE scheme.Other issues included the financial difficulty for Solomon Islanders in meeting visa requirements particularly medical examinations.Mr Tozaka said he relayed some of these difficulties to his New Zealand counterpart Murray McCully and was pleased to receive an offer of technical assistance.""We can talk about increasing our number. But it is also very important that the government through my ministry take ownership, leadership and engagement by putting in resources and also to put in place a policy that will guide the RSE program in the country,"" said Milner Tozaka.

Steep airfares are a major impediment to Solomon Island workers wanting to take part in New Zealand's Recognised Seasonal Employers scheme.The labour mobility scheme provides special work visas for Pacific Islanders to work in New Zealand's viticulture and horticulture industries.This year there are more than 600 Solomon Islands RSE workers - the highest number since the scheme began in 2007.By comparison however smaller Pacific nations such as Vanuatu, which has more than 4000 RSE workers, and Samoa and Tonga, which have about 2000 workers respectively, are doing way better.The Solomon Islands foreign minister Milner Tozaka said this was partly due to a need for increased capacity within his ministry to facilitate RSE workers applications but also because there were no direct flights between Solomon Islands and New Zealand.""Although they have expressed, the employers have expressed interest to increase our participation in the future. The biggest hindrance to recruiting more Solomon Islanders is in the airfare costs. To bring a [Ni-] Vanuatu here it only costs $NZ 900 but to bring our worker it costs $NZ 1500 plus other costs,"" he said.Milner Tozaka also wants the New Zealand's RSE scheme to allow Solomon Islanders to work in areas apart from viticulture and horticulture.Mr Tozaka, who was in New Zealand last week, asked for his country's workers to be involved in areas like construction, fisheries and hospitality.Mr Tozaka praised the RSE scheme calling it his ministry's flagship arrangement and one which has improved the lives of many Solomon Islanders.According to government statistics in the 2016 season alone RSE workers remitted almost $US3 million to Solomon Islands.New Zealand and Solomon Islands will later this year sign a new Inter-Agency Understanding on the RSE scheme in New Zealand during its 10th anniversary celebrations.

Earlier this year services to Atoifi in East Malaita were temporarily suspended and the main Gwaunaru'u airport on Malaita reopened last year after being closed for almost six years over a dispute.Mr Sigimanu said the airline hopes the Santa Cruz suspension will end soon.""It is really an issue that is beyond our control, it is to be resolved between the claimants of the land where the airstrip is located and the government. So once they resolve that issue and they advise us we can resume services back into Santa Cruz, "" Colin Sigimanu said.Mr Sigimanu said there were also at least two other provincial airstrips in the Solomon Islands which have been closed indefinitely because of land disputes.One of these a new multi-million dollar airstrip on Manaoba in North Malaita has not been used since it was first commissioned in 2013.",14 Mar 2017

Of course they went to higher ground and some of them went to the clinic and after the aftershock they went back to higher ground so there's still a lot of anxiety among the people there after the shocks and tremors.""

RIPEL was once the biggest company in the Solomons but has been riven with disputes between foreign owners, the government, unions, and workers for over a decade.

Russell Islands Plantation Estates Limited, or RIPEL, was one of the main economic drivers of the Solomon Islands in the late nineties to early 2000s.Consultations by the government began this week with stakeholders and the public to find lasting solutions to the issue of whether RIPEL has a future.The plantation previously contributed millions worth of production to the national economy per annum and employed more than 800 people before it collapsed in 2004.Chairman of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on RIPEL Dickson Mua who is also the MP for Savo-Russels in the Central Province acknowledged that finding a way forward was not an easy task.But he said the government was confident that a solution could be found through a consultative approach.This process ends on Friday and a report to the Government ie expected early next year.The cabinet sub-committee's aim is to explore the best options for the national government to address outstanding issues in a manner that is fair to all parties taking into account all competing and sometimes overlapping interests.A row over work conditions and the style of management on the large island plantation in the immediate aftermath of several years of ethnic unrest in the country resulted in a workers' strike which quickly spiralled out of control when the company declared the strike illegal and tried to shut it down by force.As a result RIPEL company representatives were evicted from the plantation's islands which continue to be occupied by former workers and their families.The customary landowners of the islands, who claim their forefathers were duped into selling the islands to the RIPEL company, have also weighed in on the issue, demanding the islands be returned to them as the rightful owners.The company representatives however have maintained for years that the islands are illegally occupied and the failure of the Solomon Islands Government and the country's police force to evict the former workers from the islands amounts to an inability to enforce the law.Successive governments have tried and failed to find a solution to the RIPEL problem, however the current government, which is half way through its term, is adamant that resolving it is a priority.",15 Dec 2016

This comes after a meeting between Manasseh Sogavare and the heads of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, or RAMSI, last week.RAMSI's special co-ordinator, Quinton Devlin, said it was important to start rearming special units before RAMSI leaves the country next June.Mr Devlin said this would ensure local police could make the most of RAMSI's expertise and resources.There has been mixed reaction to the prospect of rearming, as the force's weapons fell into militant hands during the ethnic crisis of more than a decade ago.Mr Sogavare was also briefed on the challenges posed by the fact there were still guns in the communities despite a ban imposed in 2003.RAMSI's deputy special co-ordinator Alex Cameron suggested another gun amnesty before RAMSI left Solomon Islands.""Solomon Islands has achieved the phenomenal record as the country with the lowest gun crime rate in the world,"" said Mr Cameron in a statement, adding that ""there is still room for improvement should there be another gun amnesty period before June 2017.""",5 Dec 2016

The Sub-Committee on Legal and Institutional Issues was tasked by MSG leaders at their Honiara summit in July to clarify guidelines for observer, associate and full membership in the group.This comes as the MSG's five full members - Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia's FLNKS Kanaks Movement - grapple with whether to grant full membership to West Papuans.The United Liberation Movement for West Papua was granted observer status in the MSG last year but its bid for full membership has been deferred pending clarity on the guidelines.Indonesia, which has associate membership status in the MSG, has opposed the Liberation Movement's bid, saying its own involvement in the group covers West Papuans.

Opening the two day meeting at the MSG secretariat, a Solomon Islands Foreign Affairs official, William Soaki, suggested the guidelines needed to contribute to the overall objective of the group.It echoed recent comments by Vanuatu's Prime Minister Charlot Salwai that since last year MSG membership criteria had been developed which did not reflect the group's founding principles, which were about decolonising Melanesia.Mr Soaki said guidelines were required to provide a more streamlined and clear scope for leaders to use in assessing expressions of interest for some form of membership in the MSG.The Director General of the MSG Secretariat, Amena Yauvoli, encouraged the committee to provide ""a workable resolution going forward"".He said the deliberation of the committee was ""pivotally important for the future of the organisation"" as the issue of West Papuan membership could make or break the organisation.Pending development of the guidelines, a leader summit was expected in the next couple of months to make a decision on the Liberation Movement's application.

The Solomons' envoy on West Papua, Rex Horoi, said his government won't respond to what is effectively a media statement.""Due to the fact that we have not received any formal communication (on the matter) either from Jakarta or from Canberra, why should we respond at this stage? Therefore we will not respond until we receive such communication through diplomatic channels,"" he said.Mr Ryacudu also told Australian media that it is better if Canberra delivers the warning to Pacific governments, because if it was left to him he would 'twist their ears' and described Indonesia as a sleeping tiger that can attack if disturbed.However Mr Horoi said Pacific countries raised Papua in global fora because West Papuans lives matter.""We speak collectively on abuse and human rights violations in West Papua because we have received reliable sources of information,"" he explained, ""and therefore that is the collective concern of the civil society, public and governments of the region.""Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has confirmed having discussed West Papua last week with the Indonesian Defence Minister, but wouldn't be pressed on whether Canberra will pass the warning on.",4 Nov 2016

Gizo Hospital, in the country's west, had been cleared of asbestos in a study carried out by the Pacific Community's environmental programme, SPREP, prior to the July fire.But local inspectors identified asbestos, which is dangerous when it becomes airborne, after the fire destroyed much of the hospital.A SPREP team identified materials used in recent renovations as the likely cause of the contamination.PacWaste project manager Stewart Williams said the cost of clearing old asbestos was already daunting, without more being imported.

""Altogether on the Pacwaste project we are spending about $3.5 million on the asbestos project and probably about $2.5 million on physical intervention.""But it is a drop in the ocean because that is quite small compared to the total cost of asbestos removal in the Pacific, which we gauge would be around US$150 million""Asbestos is not banned in any Pacific country, and New Zealand is only bringing in an asbestos ban later this year.According to the World Health Organization (WHO) asbestos related diseases are responsible for more than 100,000 deaths each year.The topic of a Pacific-wide ban on the import of asbestos products will be raised at a SPREP meeting in Niue later this month.

The Ministry of Infrastructure is already rolling out a major upgrade to make the entirety of this coastal highway four lanes and putting in large roundabouts for problem intersections.However the ministry's under-secretary Jimmy Nuake said a second highway through the hills behind the city is the only long term solution to the Honiara's traffic problems.The deputy premier of Guadalcanal, where Honiara is situated, Peter Orainisaka, welcomed the proposal, but warned a lot of issues needed to be addressed to ensure the road benefitted both the people of his province and the country.Jimmy Nuake acknowledged that the government needed the support of customary landowners and provincial governments to be able to carry out such a large infrastructure development.But he also stressed that it was important to have this infrastructure to enable the economy to grow.The proposed highway, which is still a concept at this stage, would run inland from Alligator creek on the eastern end of the Honiara International Airport towards April Ridge in the hills behind Honiara and cut back down to Poha Bridge past the western end of the City.A second inner Honiara link is also being proposed to run from the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Office at Rove through to Mud Alley in front of the King Solomon Hotel and up into lower Vavaya Ridge past the Rock Haven Motel and connecting to the old Chinatown Bridge.",7 Sep 2016

""It really just highlights the difficulties in managing these highly migratory shared resources,"" he said.""So a lot of these turtles are migrating out of the Solomons and then passing through Papua New Guinea and then dropping down into Australia. So it really does highlight the need to have some sort of regional agreements and regional management measures which aren't just site based for these species.""

However Richard Hamilton said poaching remains an issue despite the presence of full-time rangers.""It has become a bit of a problem more so in recent years and we believe that is probably being driven by a growing demand for illegally purchased hawksbill products. Probably mainly out of mainland China. So there are buyers in Honiara now which are paying reasonable prices for this hawksbill shell and we think it is probably being re-exported out of the country. And there is also a smaller trade I think in the production of local items like bracelets and hairclips etc which are sold to tourists in that trade.""

I believe the board is working on some programs with the government being now a bit more receptive and positive.

The Liberation Movement's spokesperson, Benny Wenda, said this could be seen as a delay tactic but his organisation acknowledged the technical issues highlighted by the MSG leaders and senior officials.The issue of West Papua membership is increasingly divisive for the MSG's five full members.Since the Liberation Movement was last year granted observer status, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and new Caledonia's FLNKS Kanaks movement have pushed for the West Papuans to get full membership.However, Fiji and Papua New Guinea have resisted the push, amid strong lobbying by MSG associate member Indonesia which is opposed to the Liberation Movement.Vanuatu's government has expressed disappointment at the outcome of last week's summit.However the Liberation movement is remaining upbeat, describing the MSG's decision as progress to improving processes within the MSG.It said there would be further discussion at the MSG meeting scheduled for Vanuatu's capital in September.""We want to thank our Melanesian leaders and the chair and Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands for discussing and facilitating our application for full membership.

That's under review at the moment. Our technical officials are still working on it. And for example, the draft that they came up with had flaws in it.

Police are hoping the law, which also allows them to carry out random breath tests, will help reduce alcohol-related traffic accidents and deaths in the country.Now, first-time offenders with a blood alcohol level of 0.05 percent or above will face a US$1284 fine, while second time offenders will be fined US$2567.In both cases offenders will have their licence suspended and they could also face 12 months' imprisonment.The Director of the National Traffic Unit, Paul Bulu, said he believed the penalties would be an effective deterrent.""The message there is very clear, when you are thinking of driving don't drink, if you are thinking of drinking don't drive. Random breath testing can happen anywhere, anyplace, at anytime and if you are driving and drinking will be caught.""Paul Bulu said random breath testing would begin in Honiara in the next few weeks, before being rolled out to the provinces by the end of the year.",6 Jun 2016

Mr Sogavare, who is the prime minister of Solomon Islands, has also declared his country's support for the United Liberation Movement for West Papua's bid to be a full member of the MSG.Mr Sogavare has just been in Port Vila where he met with his Vanuatu counterpart Charlot Salwai whose proposal to give the Liberation Movement full membership at the MSG is to be discussed at an upcoming MSG leaders summit in Papua New Guinea.While in Vila, the MSG chair met with visiting representatives of the Liberation Movement which has strong support in Indonesia's Papua region.Since the West Papuans were granted observer status in the MSG last year, Mr Sogavare said the situation in Indonesia's Papua region had become more tense, leaving the indigenous people on the ""brink of extinction"".This comes after Indonesia's leading human rights organisation said that since the new government came to power in late 2014, abuses in Papua were as rampant as they were under previous governments.

Indonesia was granted MSG associate member status last year in a bid to foster dialogue with Jakarta on West Papua.However, in a statement, Mr Sogavare censured Jakarta for rebuffing his his request for dialogue on Papua.'Indonesia has crossed the line so we need to take some tough stance,"" he said.A recent surge in Indonesian diplomatic overtures to Pacific Islands countries is increasingly seen as being about countering the growing regional support for West Papuan self-determination aspirations.However Melanesian leaders are frustrated at Jakarta's apparent aversion to meaningful dialogue about West Papua.The Indonesian President Joko Widodo's refusal to meet with Mr Sogavare in his capacity as the MSG chair has been proffered as grounds for the Melanesian states to ""take the matter up to the next notch which is the United Nations"".Mr Sogavare said as well as the membership bid, the MSG summit would address the group's pursuit of UN action on what he called ""genocides committed against humanity in West Papua by Indonesia"".While Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia's Kanaks have signalled support for West Papua's membership bid, it remains uncertain where the other two full MSG members - Fiji and PNG - stand.Governments of both countries have closer ties with Indonesia than the others, and Jakarta has recently said that it has support of the Fiji and PNG for its own bid for full MSG membership.

Vanuatu appeared to counter that when prime minister Salwai suggested Indonesia should be stripped of its membership status within the MSG.The West Papua issue continues to be a stern test of MSG unity.The upcoming MSG leaders summit was already shadowed by division among the members of the appointment of a new director-general.Last month Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu objected to confirmation by the MSG chairman that the Fiji diplomat Amena Yauvoli had been selected for the role, which has been vacant since last year.Earlier, it came as a surprise to other MSG members that the Fiji Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola announced Mr Yauvoli's appointment to media, when the formal selection process was still underway.

The MSG summit, originally scheduled for the first week of May in Vanuatu, was supposed to be when the leaders deliberated on the director-general's appointment.Vanuatu had put forward its own nomination for the role, its ambassador to the European Union Roy Mickey-Joy, and insisted that the selection be finalised at the summit.This prompted an exchange between Charlot Salwai and his Solomon Islands counterpart over MSG procedure.At the last minute,the summit was postponed, amid reports that Fiji's prime minister Frank Bainimarama opted instead to attend the Queen's birthday celebrations in Britain.The MSG chairman said the summit would now be held next month, in Port Moresby.

We are becoming a minority in our land and even in our own church while the Indonesian people master all aspects of life.""

Tensions are rising in Solomon Islands over the encroachment onto Guadalcanal provincial lands by residents from the capital Honiara.Illegal squatting was one of the major causes of an ethnic crisis which tore the country apart in the late 90's and early 2000's.The squatter problem is once again reaching critical levels, according to the new premier of the Guadalcanal provincial government, Anthony Veke.Mr Veke said his government and people want squatters off provincial and alienated land around the city limits but that calls for national government intervention were falling on deaf ears.""We can't rule out conflict between the land-owning tribes, the people who claim they own the land and the people who are squatting on those lands,"" he said.""We have to foresee the risks that are ahead of us and if we want Solomon Islands and Guadalcanal for that matter to be peaceful we have to address those risks that are ahead of those situations.""Anthony Veke said he felt this was a matter of national security and that the national government, the city council and the wider Solomon Islands community should prioritise finding a solution to the problem.

Secondly, the office also said its statement might have wrongly implied government endorsement of one company over the other based on the Court ruling and that one company was more reputable than the other, which was not the case.It said the office of the prime minister would like to apologise if its statement was interpreted in this manner by the management, the board and shareholders of Axiom KB Limited, and expressly withdrew it.It also apologised if the implication of the press release meant that Axiom Mining Ltd and Axiom KB Limited were not reputable mining companies.The Solomons' government said it was mindful that the court ruling ensures both companies applications for mining of nickel in the Isabel tenements were again on the drawing board, offering a level-playing field for all parties to start again.Thirdly, the office of the prime minister understood the press statement had been carried out of context by the international media that might potentially undermine the reputation of one company over the other outside of Solomon Islands.The office of the prime minister wanted to assure both companies the government was mindful of the high international regard for each of the companies in their countries of origin, Australia and Japan.It said it would like to apologise to the parties concerned for any inconvenience, financial strain or ill-feeling that the erroneous press release might have caused to them and their stakeholders.",23 Mar 2016

Nixon Asugeni is a Solomon Islander who has been working under the RSE scheme for more than six straight seasons.I met him and a gaggle of his countrymen, who were employed through Focus Contracting, at the Angus Inn in Hastings, where about 80 RSE workers have been staying.""We have to work so that we bring the money back home for our family,"" he said.""The thing that we do back home is building the family, especially building the houses, school fees for our kids, sending them to school, university sometimes.""It was about 32°C that day and Mr Asugeni admitted that, even for Pacific Islanders, working in such heat was challenging. Earlier that day, I felt like I was about to die of heat exhaustion while walking through a couple of orchards in Twyford.I asked another Solomon Islander, Andrew Genima'asua, if he and other workers had the chance to go for a beer after a day's work in the sun.It was something they had little time for, he said. Their main social outlet was generally the church.""Sometimes when we get free we can go but if we get busy we cannot go to the church. We just keep working. I send my money to help my family and pay my kids' school fees.""Whatever their nationality, the goals of the RSE workers were usually the same: to earn money that would help them and their community back home.Tuuta Lavemai, from Tonga, has done five years of RSE work.""We have no work in Tonga, no money, not enough jobs in Tonga, "" he explained. ""We have a lot of jobs in New Zealand, to make money. Really, really good.""Grape pruner Smith Isaiah, from Vanuatu, who was in his third year in Hawke's Bay, said that achieving his goal was starting to get easier.""Not like the first year when I was here, it's hard for me. But this year... it's much easier. So I took the money back to build a new home, start a new living, because the cyclone damaged all the houses, so I sent the money back to build a new home, start a new business.""It's approaching a decade since the RSE scheme began.There were some early teething problems such as occasional incidents related to workers' socialising, or issues over labour conditions under some contractors.But, over the years, the system has become more efficient and the conditions have improved.Returning workers have adapted to life in New Zealand and the productivity has increased. All the contractors I spoke to in Hawke's Bay pointed out that, in these industries, New Zealanders often weren't up for the work.Anthony Rarere is the general manager for Pick Hawke's Bay, a co-operative of 42 different orchards, which employs over 300 RSE workers.""These industries have struggled historically with maintaining adequate labour supply because it's always been seen as low-skilled work,"" he said.""It's definitely hard work - very physically demanding, getting up early on cold days, hot days, rainy days... so it's not very appealing.""

The workers generally earn a minimum rate of $NZ16.50 an hour. Most can also get paid additionally for higher output, meaning a worker can often earn over $200 a day in peak season.While New Zealand's RSE scheme is increasingly seen as a win-win arrangement for contractors and workers, Australia has been slow to offer seasonal work to people from neighbouring Pacific Island countries.Australia's version of the RSE scheme only took shape in the past year or so, remains at a low level and is currently plagued by reports that Pacific workers are being ripped off.Back in New Zealand, there is growing demand for the Pacific workers.Echoing the lament of Hawke's Bay apple growers, viticulture industry managers have spoken of a dearth in general labour supply.The co-director of another RSE participant company, Jonathan Buck, who manages the Woodthorpe Terraces vineyards, said this season had highlighted how much the industry relied on Pacific workers.""Yeah, if we had another four at least, I think, that would really help us out. We're just finding ourselves having to postpone jobs or get other people in at short notice to help catch up. So there's only so many of them around. Everyone wants them.""Mr Rarere said that orchards in his co-operative had told him that they wouldn't be in business if it weren't for RSE.""They've had to struggle for so many years to find a consistent, reliable labour source, that it was getting unbearable. Then RSE came around in 2006, 2007, whenever it was... it was a game changer.""
The workers have been described as invaluable to New Zealand's horticulture and viticulture industries.

Far from home, for up to seven months at a time, the RSE workers are apart from their family and friends, their home community.Those early days in New Zealand can be wrenching, especially if climate chaos is ripping at the workers' villages back home.I met a group of 12 Fijians who arrived in Hawke's Bay for their second year of RSE work on the day before Cyclone Winston smashed through Fiji last month.One of the group, Waqa Nalivou, told me about not being able to connect through to family back home for days, to check if they had survived the storm.""That Saturday, Sunday, was some of the tough days for us,"" he explained.The Fijians were a solid group and I could see that living and working together as a unit gave them strength at such times.""What happens back home keeps us strong, keeps us moving forward"" said Fijian Necani Qele while up a tree, picking pears, back in the orchard. ""We have to earn money, we have to work hard, we have to sweat for it, even though it's hot, it's 33°C.""Not all the workers find it easy to adapt to life in New Zealand. Coming here is a big lifestyle change, but it offers potentially life-changing experiences for the workers.Knox Misikeni, from the Solomon Islands, said that in the eight seasons he'd been with RSE, he'd taken on many new ideas.""Then we learn many things here aout the lifestyle and things,"" he said. ""When we go back home, we learn from that and we know how to change some of the things that we saw it here. It makes a difference for us.""

I asked Pick Hawke's Bay's Anthony Rarere how effective the Pacific workers were at saving their earnings during a labour season.""We've got guys who go home with nothing,"" he admitted, ""but that group is getting smaller and the group who are doing something [with their earnings] is getting bigger.""Pick Hawke's Bay's recruitment efforts in the islands, he said, now tended to focus on picking workers who had a clear idea about what they wanted to achieve through the work.One of the RSE workers spoken to by RNZI, Fijian Ilaisa Doraisavu, said that people back home were increasingly interested in joining the scheme.""When we went back last year, we've been telling them the stories, and they've seen what we're doing in the village: most of the boys have been building houses, extending their houses, some start their small business,"" he explained.""That's why most of the boys in the village will like to come and join the work that's being done in New Zealand.""It might be the best example of how New Zealand is helping the lives of Pacific Island communities. Above all it's a partnership.

The former Prime Minister was 72 and had governed the country for five years, before becoming foreign minister and a key figure in the peace process of the late 1990s and early 2000s.Sir Peter was born in Takataka village on Malaita in 1943, at the height of the Second World War when his country was the scene of some of the war's most intense and bloody battles.He went to school in Malaita and Honiara, the capital, before being awarded a New Zealand government scholarship to study in New Zealand, where he spent four years at Wesley College and Wanganui College before studying to become a teacher at Ardmore College.He returned to Malaita to teach, but kept a keen interest in Solomon Islands politics, becoming one of the founding members of the Solomon Islands United Party.In 1976, he said he was asked to run for office to represent southern Malaita, at a time when the country's quest for independence had gained true momentum.""I came into Honiara and asked if anyone else was interested in standing for my constituency,"" Sir Peter said in a 1995 interview for RNZ International's ""New Flags Flying"" series.Read/Listen to more about Peter Kenilorea on RNZ International's New Flags Flying series.""A friend of mine said: 'There were six interested, but they heard you were also interested, they've all declined, all pulled out.' So I took that as a definite lead and that's how I entered politics.""Sir Peter entered the public service and became the chief minister for the British colonial administration shortly after, as the country's amble towards independence developed into a breakneck gallop.For years there had been tension with the British rulers, particularly over a lack of opportunities for Solomon Islanders.Since the 1930s village headmen had asked government missions to build schools and dispensaries, increase wages and copra payments and move towards a more native, representative parliament.The requests were often dismissed, and the post-war return of plantation owners and officials led to the emergence of the 'Maasina Rule' - a brotherhood movement that sought local control.""With due respect in hindsight, it's obvious the British hadn't done very much for Solomon Islands,"" said Sir Peter.""Their main emphasis was on law and order, no emphasis on economic development - that was almost nil - they only had one school, most education was in the hands of all the churches. The colonial administration had only one school, the King George VI school.""In 1978, the Solomon Islands followed many of its Pacific neighbours and became an independent state and Peter Kenilorea became the country's first prime minister.Sir Peter said the country barely had to fight for independence, and he had a sense that Britain was ready to wipe its hands of its Melanesian colony.""They had had enough of the Solomon Islands and just wanted to go away,"" he said.""I told them so during the independence constitutional negotiations in London. I said: 'We want this extra money, above what you've already agreed for, because you haven't done anything and we'd like to do something ourselves after you've gone.""Sir Peter was 35 when he became prime minister, charged with the daunting task of forming some kind of national unity in a country divided by culture, tradition, and geography.""I was pretty young for purposes of leadership, you know, in our society, leadership belongs to the chiefs and to the older people,"" he said.""But when you talk in terms of the context of the nation, quite honestly, that is beyond the bounds of traditional leadership. They should continue to know that they can be well and truly respected in their traditional situation. But at the national level, I think it must be given way to people with some education who can think widely.""However, despite a decades-long push for independence, and widespread jubilation at the lowering of one flag and the raising of another on 7 July 1978, many Solomon Islanders remained apprehensive about what their new-found independence would bring.""It was a very joyous moment, but also a very challenging one. We had never been alone before, ever. There's always a fear of the unknown, the uncertainties of the unknown,"" Sir Peter said in the 1995 interview.""The mass of people were saying 'Are we doing the right thing?' There were comments and songs about 'We're not ready' and 'We don't have enough money.' But I felt then that independence is not about money, but deciding about being yourself - which is your right. Every human being is born free and to be shackled by a system which is outside of yourself is not human in my view.""Sir Peter served as Prime Minister until Solomon Mamaloni was elected in 1981, and again from 1984 to 1986.During that time, Sir Peter set about establishing a constitution to bind the country as one, created laws to cement tribal land rights and ownership, which the British were against, and creating the system of provincial government that still exists today.He then served as foreign minister from 1988 to 1989 and from 1990 to 1993, when he became the director of the Forum Fisheries Agency.But when ethnic tensions in the Solomon Islands boiled over into violent conflict between the Malaita Eagle Force and the Guadalcanal-based Isatabu Freedom Movement in the late 1990s, Sir Peter returned to spearhead the process of restoring peace to the country.Dr Tarcisius Kabutalaka, a Solomon Islands academic based in Hawaii, who was involved in negotiations for the Townsville Peace Agreement, a key attempt to resolve the unrest in 2000, said Sir Peter was crucial to the process as he managed to command a level of respect across all sides that others could not.""He was one of those individuals who was respected by both sides and by people from all walks of life in Solomon Islands,"" Dr Kabutalaka said in a phone interview.""From the government, or in the church, or in civil society organisations, and even among the so-called militants during the conflict. They all saw him as somebody they could trust.""The Townsville Agreement ultimately failed and the conflict continued for another three years until an Australian-led multinational force arrived in 2003, but Sir Peter remained at the helm as co-chair of the Peace Monitoring Council for years after the conflict ended.He also served as the Speaker of Parliament from 2001 to 2005, when he unsuccessfully sought the position of Governor General, and returned to the speaker's chair until 2010.Sir Peter then retired from public life as he began a long battle with illness, and public appearances became rare in recent months apart from the occasional public ceremony.He died on Thursday night at his family home in Honiara and a state funeral is likely to be held next week.""He was a very thoughtful, very honourable person who carried himself very well,"" said Dr Kabutalaka, who said Sir Peter Kenilorea would be remembered as a revered and noble statesman, and a great founding father.He is survived by his wife, Margaret, and his eight children.",26 Feb 2016

Police in Solomon Islands have confiscated an undisclosed amount of what is believed to be gold bullion found on a sunken ship in the Ontong Java atoll.The Solomons Business Magazine reports the suspected gold bars estimated to be worth millions of dollars have been transported to the Central Bank of Solomon Islands for safekeeping.The shipment is understood to have arrived into the capital Honiara from Ontong Java on Friday where it was confiscated by police acting on a tip-off.The Solomon Business Magazine said a police source involved in the operation told them there were at least 100 of the suspected gold bars as well as other metals believed to be silver.The CBSI has confirmed receipt of the cargo but declined to comment on the nature of its contents or quantity.In 2013, the Solomon Islands government was reported to be set on recovering more than 1.5 billion US dollars worth of gold bars thought to be on the ocean floor between Guadalcanal and Malaita.A former MP and freelance journalist, Alfred Sasako, at the time said he understood the gold was believed to be in the wreck of a Japanese ship sunk during the Second World War.Mr Sasako said a man from Isabel province had told his son the location of the sunken ship. Mr Sasako told RNZ International that the government of the day had been harassing the man to disclose the wreck's location.The Solomon Islands campaign in the Second World War cost the Allies about 7,100 men, 29 ships and 615 aircraft.

What we're seeing in the courts is actually a microcosm of attitudes that are held generally within society.""The researchers analysed 908 sentencing records involving sexual and gender-based violence in Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, PNG, Kiribati and Vanuatu.Each case was analysed to determine whether gender stereotypes, customary reconcilation or other discriminatory factors were considered during sentencing.Such factors were raised in three quarters of the cases analysed and led to an actual reduction in sentence in 52% of cases.The study found after such factors were considered, average final sentences for domestic violence cases were reduced from 2.43 years to 0.98 years and for sexual assault cases from 8.71 years to 5.19 years.The report argues gender bias in the courts must be tackled through a combination of education, law reform and monitoring.",23 Dec 2015

But I think it's a region which shouldn't have any problems with suifficiently resourcing the work programme of the secretariat.""Mr Forau also says various issues among member states had made his job difficult.He felt he no longer has the strength of all MSG members for implementing the group's work programme.Mr Forau also says lingering problems in member relationships has made his job difficult.""There have been some influences exerted on some of our members about how they should relate to Fiji during the time when the government was not an elected government. And so some of those relationship issues are still around, and sometimes something has happened between, for example, Papua New Guinea and Fiji... issues that sometimes you come across in your meetings as well and they don't help at all.""Peter Forau says the MSG is constrained by the fact it has fewer member states than other regional organisations.The MSG has five full members - Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and the FLNKS of New Caledonia.Whereas Mr Forau says the Pacific Islands Forum for instance has 16 full members and the SPC, the Pacific Community, has 26.Peter Forau says in terms of sharing the burden of resourcing the group agencies, other regional organisations are better placed than the MSG which has to share the resourcing burden over only five members, one of which (the FLNKS) is dependent on the others to meet its financial obligations.

If you really cannot prove that it is true that we don't pay any taxes. And I don't believe that, 500 million dollars (SBD) you need another, at least 500 shipments.

The Manasseh Sogavare-led government, which hosts the MSG Leaders summit next week, says it will endorse West Papua to be an observer and this status would be ""given only to one united group"".In a statement, the Government says it would agree that any submission for full membership by a group representing Melanesians throughout Indonesia must be united and done in consultation with Indonesia.It says it also wants the MSG to continue looking at ways to make Indonesia an associate member of the MSG.The Government says it has made its decisions to enhance Melanesian solidarity, values, continuity and maintain good neighbourliness.The New Caledonia FLNKS and Vanuatu have traditionally backed West Papua's push to join the MSG, but Port Vila's position is unclear after the toppling of the Natuman Government.Fiji has been strongly backing the Jakarta position and the leadership in Papua New Guinea has been ambivalent on the issue.A Solomon Islands MP has labelled as vague and weak the government's official announcement on the West Papuan bid to join the MSG.Mr Sogavare hasn't specified if his administration backs the United Liberation Movement for West Papua for gaining observer status.It says it also wants the MSG to look at increasing Indonesia's representation in the MSG.To the West Makira MP, Derrick Manuari, the announcement is a sign of weak decision-making, given the strong public support for the West Papuans""The decision by the government of Solomon Islands is not good enough.

West Papuan representatives look to Fiji prime minister Frank Bainimarama to help realise their MSG aspiration.

The Pacific islands sub-regional organisation is considering a membership bid by West Papuans of Indonesia.MSG member governments are struggling to balance their growing ties to Jakarta with regional grassroots support for the indigenous people of West Papua where a separatist conflict has simmered for decades.The United Liberation Movement for West Papua was formed last year when Vanuatu hosted a reunification summit for West Papuan representative groups. This includes groups who are aiming for independence from Indonesia. The groups came together to launch a new bid to join the MSG after an earlier application by a West Papuan group was deemed by MSG leaders, including Papua New Guinea's Peter O'Neill, not to be representative enough of West Papuans.""We feel that it must be representative of all Melanesians living in Indonesia,"" said O'Neill, ""and that the application be made in consultation with the Indonesian government.""Now, MSG leaders are grappling with whether to admit the West Papuans or to defer to an arrangement for membership of all five Indonesian provinces with traces of Melanesian ethnicity. Indonesia, which says it has eleven million Melanesians, already has observer status at the MSG and is opposed to the Papuans' bid.Last month, Fiji's prime minister Frank Bainimarama said the best thing to do was to make Indonesia an associate MSG member, adding it made no sense to bring in Papua separately. This has drawn criticism from Fiji civil society leaders like Shamima Ali of the Fiji's Women's Crisis Centre.""It's a big shame on Melanesian leaders, particularly Fiji and the others who are pussy-footing around the issue, and they are not very clear - apart from Vanuatu of course,"" she said.""So I think they have really gone back on their word from supporting the West Papuan Liberation Movement to what it is now saying about Indonesia being in a position to decide what is happening and to address the human rights abuses and so on.""With four trips to Papua region in the past year, Indonesia's new president Joko Widodo has placed new emphasis on resolving social and development problems in Papua. Jokowi, as he is called, made headlines in his most recent trip there last month when he freed five Papuan political prisoners and declared that the effective ban on foreign journalists in Papua was lifted. Subsequent comments by Indonesian government figures indicate that the restrictions were not being relaxed at all. Just this week, he has also been contradicted by a government minister on his signal that there would be an end to the transmigration programme, which has seen hundreds of thousands of Javanese relocated to Papua over the past few dacades.The president's aims to solve Papua issues face significant obstacles because he is relatively weak and beholden to other interests both within his own party and the national legislature. However Jokowi's administration is placing increasing value on the MSG membership. His last Papua jaunt was followed by a visit to Port Moresby where PNG's Foreign Minister Rimbink Pato insisted that any West Papuan bid to join the MSG should be endorsed by Indonesia.""It's not for us to force Indonesia on how to run their affairs,"" said Pato.

Pato said that if there was an application, the MSG wanted to ensure that it was representative of the Melanesian that they claimed to represent.""So we don't want a group that is factionalised fully supported by one group of Melanesians living in the US or somewhere in Europe or Australia and then cause more problems than fix.""Indonesia has been taking steps to integrate more with Melanesian countries in areas of culture, trade and investment. Jakarta's new outreach included a recent tour to PNG, Solomon Islands and Fiji by Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi. On offer for the Melanesian countries was twenty million US dollars for capacity development projects within the MSG.Ms Marsudi also had talks with Vanuatu's Foreign Minister Sato Kilman. Mr Kilman's indication that his country could open an embassy in Jakarta appeared at odds with Vanuatu's long-held support for West Papua independence. Little surprise then that this week, Vanuatu's prime minister Joe Natuman sacked Mr Kilman. A spokesman for the prime minister, Kiery Manassah, said the foreign minister's representations on West Papua did not reflect the government's position.""Indonesia has lobbied very hard to get Fiji and Papua New Guinea on side,"" explained Manassah. ""Recently when we went to Japan for the PALM meeting, Prime Minister O'Neill also proposed to the prime minister (Natuman) that they're thinking of supporting Indonesia to become an associate member.""Kiery Manassah signalled that Vanuatu was wary of a shifting of the goalposts on the MSG issue.""In line with the agreements from Noumea and Papua New Guinea, the MSG must discuss the West Papua application,"" he said. ""If the Indonesians want to become an associate member, they have to follow the same process, by applying.""Of the five full MSG members, Vanuatu and New Caledonia's indigenous Kanak movement, the FLNKS, have voiced support for the West Papuan bid. PNG and Fiji appear to be leaning against it. Solomon Islands is somewhere in the middle.Its foreign minister, Milner Tozaka, said the government hasn't made a decision yet.""This is a process we have to follow. We can't just make decisions on an ad hoc basis,"" said the minister. ""And Solomon Islands has made a position in the last government, we have not made a statement yet, we are following up that decision that they made. And if there is going to be any variation, we need to talk about it in the coming meeting.""

A Solomons MP Derrick Manuari expressed disappointment in his country's lack of conviction on the issue despite what he described as overwhelming support from Melanesia's public for West Papua.""I think it is very sad to see Melanesian leaders singing a distorted tune. The Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea initially supported the cause for West Papua to be a member of MSG however he is singing now a different tune and Bainimarama is also saying the same thing. But we don't see that as an appropriate approach of addressing the issues of MSG. ""The West Makira MP said the precedent had been set in the case of the Kanaks who were given MSG membership rights over France.""It is not a sovereignty issue - it is a solidarity issue, of solidarity of Melanesian states, Melanesian territories in Melanesia. So the precedent is already set. That West Papua as a Melanesian state should be admitted as a member of MSG and not Indonesia. It's not Melanesia.""Mr Manuari urged MSG leaders when they meet for their annual summit in Honiara later this month to remember the reason the group was originally founded - to help the decolonisation of Melanesian peoples.Vanuatu's new foreign minister, Kalfau Moli said Vanuatu's support for West Papua remained firm, even though the government respects Indonesia's intentions with the MSG.""Vanuatu's position as a sovereign state is that we want to address the human rights issue and then consider the supposed political independence. However having said that, it is very important that a clear forum be put in place before we can look at the issues. But I am very much for a human rights drive.""With Indonesia asserting its own Melanesian traces and growing links with governments of other Melanesian countries, the MSG leaders may look for some sort of compromise arrangement on the matter of the West Papuan membership bid. Alternately, a decision on the bid could also be deferred, as it was at the last leaders summit in Noumea. The Honiara summit may not neccessarily be the end of the matter, and the storm may pass by for the time being. But sooner or later, the MSG may have to make an emphatic move on this most divisive of issues.",8 Jun 2015

The Ministry of Mines, Energy and Rural Electrification and the Ministry of Environment, Conservation, Meteorology and Disaster Management concludes that the main water at the tailings facility at Gold Ridge mine is unsafe.In a torrent of newly released information, the government has delivered a long list of reasons for its position against the untreated release of water from the Gold Ridge dam.Some of the reasons include a critique of the sampling methods used in the recently released WHO tests on water quality which declared the tailings water safe.The government also cites a lack of consideration of the longterm cumulative effect on the enviroment and the belief that allowing the release of untreated water into the environment would set a bad precedent for future mining activities in the country.The government also in its statement revealed that its initial negotiations to purchase the mine from Australian owners St Barbara involved a nominal price tag of US$76 million.This is an amount Solomon Island taxpayers no longer have to fork out as the government has since backed out of the deal which is now left in the hands of local land owning communities in the mine area and an unnamed foreign investor.",15 Apr 2015

I was quite surprised that some of the information that they shouldn't know, they know already in some of the discussion and I won't tell what the information is but this all goes to tell you that they read exactly word for word what our discussions were and they had the upper hand.""Mr Iroga said he challenges Foreign Minister Murray McCully to live up to the standards of transparency his country demands of others.Meanwhile, the Director of the Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies at Canterbury University, Professor Steven Ratuva, felt relations between New Zealand and Solomon Islands will take a hit from the revelations.He said New Zealand's actions amount to 'subtle bullying'.""I think it's quite unprecedented in the history of the Pacific,"" said Professor Ratuva.""It raises a whole lot of questions in relation to New Zealand's relationship with Pacific Island states. It's something which I would call very subtle diplomatic bullying, because a small island state like Solomon Islands has no way to respond to spying.

But we usually identify those with some basic facilities like toilets, and some buildings that can cater for such needs,"" he said.Mr Korisa said if Cyclone Pam caused damage beyond the capacity of Vanuatu government, it would need to appeal to international donors.""There's no formal standard house here so I'm just imagining if this happens in Port Vila, it will be disastrous,"" he said.

A forecaster at Vanuatu's Meteorological Service, David Gibson, said Pam is expected to move in a southerly direction to the east of the country's northern provinces -- but these provinces would still be severly affected.Mr Gibson said he holds great concerns for the country's low-lying southern provinces, which are forecast to take a direct hit.""The islands down south are very small and very low-lying and, yeah, we're expecting very heavy rainfall, very rough seas, damaging winds as well as coastal flooding on most of these small islands.""

A Fiji Meteorological Service forecaster, Stephen Meke, said small islands in eastern Solomon Islands were already being bombarded with rain as it moved south towards Vanuatu.""The cyclone is still intensifying. We are anticipating it to cross category five over the next 24 to 48 hours. It has been dumping a lot of rain and also some very destructive winds."" Mr Meke said.The National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) in Vanuatu is scrambling to organise evacuation centres in anticipation of Tropical Cyclone Pam.Mr Korisa said new settlements around Port Vila are at risk and officials are working on an evacuation plan.""What we are doing ... we're trying to arrange the evacuation centres. We're talking with civil authorities, especially church organisations, schools and public buildings. We're trying to arrange if we can use these evacuation centres.""Cyclone Pam is then forecast to continue in a Southeast direction, between Fiji and New Caledonia, where the territory's civil defence organisation has issued a pre-alert.On its current path, Pam will pass about 200 km east of the island of Mare on Saturday, bringing violent gusts and heavy rain.In Fiji, the government has ordered that schools close tomorrow and the military has been deployed across the country as emergency services step up their preparations.Land Force Commander, Colonel Sitiveni Qiliho, said his troops were expected to play a large part in any disaster response within two hours.""We have 89 engineers deployed on 14 projects around the two main islands. They are already in position and then we've moved members of our infantry battalion into other areas that we see needs to be covered and also we have a standby element here. We're looking at 250-300 troops on 30 minutes notice to move now.""In March last year, Vanuatu was hit by Cyclone Lusi over two days, which killed 10 people dead, damaged crops and infrastructure, flooded towns and contaminated water supplies.",12 Mar 2015

Dr Allen who is studying the political economy of mining in Melanesia and is currently in Bougainville says the women in some of the families say they are earning more money mining for themselves than they ever did when the mine was operating.""The women were really happy that since the mine has closed access to the pits has been much easier for them and has been providing them with direct access to cash income which they can use for things like school fees and for taking their kids to clinics and to the hospital and so forth.""Dr Allen says the miners are using very basic methods, digging up the ore and washing it out in streams over astroturf-like material to catch the gold.He says a family can produce five grams of gold on average per day which they sell to local gold dealers for US$22 per gram, which is a substantial income by Solomon Islands standards.
