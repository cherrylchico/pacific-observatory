This is not an approach that we should be asked to defend.” When Ms Rasmussen finished, delegates whooped, applauded and stood. Marshall Islands delegates hugged and cried.The deal does not go so far as to seek a ""phase-out"" of fossil fuels, despite the pleas of more than 100 nations including small island states and European nations.Instead, it calls for ""transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade"".Tina Stege, a climate envoy for Marshall Islands, said the deal was progress.""It's a step forward, but we need a leap forward and that's, unfortunately, it's not delivering that,"" she said.The head of the Marshall Islands delegation, John Silk, said he attended the talks in an effort ""to solve the greatest challenge of our generation"".""I came here to build a canoe together,"" he said.""We have built a canoe with a weak and leaky hull, full of holes. Yet we have to put it in the water because we have no other option."" Pacific climate activists were even more scathing in their responses.""We're a little bit confused as to why people were clapping when there were people from the AOSIS countries who weren't even able to get in in time for the gavel,"" said Brianna Fruean, a Samoan climate activist.""And before people were even allowed to put up their flags and say anything about the text it was gavelled and so, there's a little bit of confusion of what this process is and if it's far, and it's not been looking fair or transparent,"" she said.Drue Slatter, a climate activist from Fiji, said there had been some improvement from the draft text presented earlier in the week.""But the improvements have been incremental not transformative,"" she said.""There was reference to transitioning away from fossil fuels and that signals a transition. But the time for signalling is long past.""We were told this was going to be a historic COP, and the outcome is far from it.""It's lukewarm at best, it's not enough to acknowledge the science and what's needed to stay below 1.5 without putting in place the concrete action.""So, I am disappointed in the outcome of COP28.""Ms Fruean said the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change process was ""broken"".""I think we saw so many lobbyists here, and obviously while we are upset at the results, there's people here who are celebrating,"" she said.""Somebody here has had a successful COP, that's the 2,000 lobbyists. And you know, we're given crumbs to celebrate, but it's like asking us to celebrate flowers that will lie on our graves, you know, how do we celebrate that?""ABC/AP","Climate Change, Environmental Impact, Environmental Policy, Fiji, Pacific, Samoa, Tonga, United Arab Emirates, World Politics, ",2023-12-14 02:15:51+00:00
1,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-11/pacific-islands-police-ministers-security-talks-beijing/103213960,"Three Pacific ministers have attended a high-level meeting on police cooperation between China and Pacific Island nations as Beijing continues its push to cement deeper security ties with the region.China's Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong convened the second ""ministerial dialogue on police cooperation"" with Pacific Island countries on Friday last week.While last year's meeting was virtual and drew in only one minister, this year's meeting was held in person in Beijing and drew in ministers from three Pacific Island countries.Solomon Islands Police Minister Anthony Veke, Samoa's Police Minister Faualo Harry Jeffrey Schuster and Tonga's Trade Minister Viliami Uasike Latu attended, while Kiribati sent Acting Police Commissioner Eeri Aritiera to the meeting.Several other Pacific Island countries sent more junior representatives.Papua New Guinea sent Assistant Police Commissioner Hodges Ette while Cook Islands sent a mid-ranking police inspector and Vanuatu the chair of its Police Service Commission.Two Pacific Island countries that recognise China — Fiji and Federated States of Micronesia — did not send any representatives at all.There is no evidence at this stage that Beijing struck any concrete agreements on Friday, with state media Xinhua reporting that Minister Wang said China was ""willing to work with all parties to foster a good ministerial dialogue mechanism and carry out practical and mutually beneficial cooperation"".Xinhua also said that the dialogue ""fully recognised the fruitful results achieved since the first one and reached broad consensus for the future cooperation"" but did not provide any details about what those results were.Sources from two of the Pacific countries that did not send ministers to the meeting also stressed that their representatives did not have the authority to sign any deals or agreements.But Australian officials have still been monitoring the gathering closely, with Pacific Minister Pat Conroy telling the ABC's Afternoon Briefing on Thursday that he was ""aware"" of a police initiative between China and the Pacific being ""in the pipeline"".Australia remains sceptical about Beijing's strategic aims in the Pacific and has been trying to lock it out as a major security player in the region, pointing out that Pacific island leaders have endorsed a ""family first"" approach to security.Graeme Smith from the Australian National University told the ABC the meeting was a clear sign that Beijing was intent on establishing an annual dialogue with the Pacific on police cooperation.""They want policy coordination, which is the main game of the Belt and Road Initiative,"" he said.""If they can have annual meetings that's a big tick — it doesn't take a lot of time, but it demonstrates a regularity to their engagement.""Dr Smith said China would probably be ""satisfied"" that it had secured the attendance of three Pacific ministers this year, even though the junior representation from some countries and absence of others would probably rankle Beijing.""It's a nice indicator of where each Pacific country sits right now in terms of their depth of friendship and trust with Chinese police cooperation,"" he said.China has been particularly intent on deepening police and security links with Solomon Islands since striking new agreements with the Pacific Island country in 2022 and earlier this year.Beijing has also been keen to highlight its role in helping provide security at the Pacific Games in the capital, Honiara, over the last few weeks.While Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea took responsibility for the vast bulk of security measures at the Games, including sending hundreds of troops and police to Honiara to help maintain stability, a small team of Chinese officers who have been seconded to Honiara also helped with ""training"" and ""security screening"" on the ground.On Monday, Solomon Islands Police Minister Anthony Veke lavished praise on the Chinese police team, saying he was ""so grateful for what the [People's Republic of China's] Government and the Ministry of Public Security have done in ensuring that the [Royal Solomon Islands Police Force] is able to deliver an effective and robust security operation during the games"".Last month, the Chinese Embassy in Vanuatu announced it would donate more equipment to local police, including one set of electronic forensic equipment, a 16-seater bus and other training gear.","China, Cook Islands, Foreign Affairs, Kiribati, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Police, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2023-12-11 05:10:06+00:00
2,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-07/australia-png-sweeping-security-agreement-threats-pacific-china/103200386,"Australia has signed a sweeping security agreement with Papua New Guinea that commits both nations to deeper information sharing and holding joint consultations in the face of any security threats. The security pact is legally binding and has ""treaty-like status"" although it is officially described as a ""Framework for Closer Security Relations"".It was signed by prime ministers Anthony Albanese and James Marape in Canberra on Thursday.That text includes a provision that says if either country believes it is facing direct or regional security threats, then both sides will consult and coordinate a response.""In the event of a security-related development that threatens the sovereignty, peace or stability of either Party, or the Pacific region, the Parties shall consult at the request of either Party and consider whether any measures should be taken in relation to the threat,"" the text reads.The agreement will not preclude PNG from signing other security agreements, but Australia has secured a provision that allows its personnel to be given equal status to ""personnel from other countries carrying out similar functions under current or future agreements"".And it says the two countries will ""prioritise"" consulting with each other on PNG's security needs – including on ""obtaining security-related equipment, capacity building, infrastructure, advice, training or logistics support"".Both countries will also have to ""coordinate"" on ""the involvement and contribution of third parties"" if they agree to provide security assistance.The agreement also comes with a $200 million funding commitment over four years from Australia to support PNG's security priorities.That funding will help PNG build up its judiciary and correctional services.It will also assist PNG in setting up a ""Police Recruit and Investigations Training Centre"" in Port Moresby, in a bid to help PNG grow and modernise its police force.That centre would also be used to train other Pacific Island police forces.PNG is looking to grow its police force, the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, from 6,000 to around 10,000 members, and will recruit dozens of former or current Australian police who will be sworn in under the command of local forces.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the agreement was ""comprehensive and historic"".""It will make it easier for Australia to help PNG address its internal security needs and for Australia and PNG to support each other's security and regional stability,"" he told reporters in Canberra.PNG Prime Minister James Marape thanked Australia for the additional support and said it would have a profound benefit for his country's national security.""What happens up north of your borders has a deep, shared effect, benefit, consequences on our region,"" Mr Marape said.But he also said that PNG maintained its position as a ""friend to all, enemy to none"" and reiterated that the agreement with Australia would not prevent his country from striking agreements with any other countries in the future.The signing is already drawing some negative reaction from senior PNG parliamentarians, including former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs committee chair Belden Namah.Mr Namah said the agreement is ""warranted and overdue"", but feels parliament wasn't consulted adequately.""I am truly disappointed that Parliament has been completely ignored and shut out of any discussions surrounding the Framework Security Agreement,"" Mr Namah said.""This is exactly the kind of treatment given to Parliament over the Defence Cooperation Agreement with the United States of America that created a storm of protests in this country.""The protests are in court and have not died down completely and we have another Security Framework Agreement with Australia delivered in the exact same manner — without prior knowledge or discussion of its contents by the people's representatives.""It comes as Beijing continues its push to expand policing ties with Pacific Island countries, inviting senior police officers from across the region to a meeting in China on Friday.The ABC has been told that police representatives or diplomatic officials from several Pacific Island nations are likely to attend, although it is not clear how many will go, either in person or virtually.Senior police officers from PNG have travelled to China for the meeting, although Police Commissioner David Manning is not attending.Police bodies from several Pacific island nations did not respond to the ABC's questions about the event.Australian officials are monitoring the meeting closely, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) briefed diplomats from like-minded countries in Canberra earlier this week.The government remains deeply suspicious of China's attempts to embed itself as a security partner in the Pacific after Beijing struck security and police agreements with Solomon Islands over the last 18 months.China also held its first annual dialogue with Pacific police ministers and officers in November last year, although only Solomon Islands was actually represented at ministerial level and some Pacific Island nations only sent junior officers to the meeting.One Australian government source told the ABC that the meeting appeared to show that China was intent on establishing an annual dialogue with the Pacific on police and security issues, although they said it was not yet clear how many nations would attend on Friday.Meanwhile, defence ministers from several Pacific and regional countries have met in New Caledonia, where they have agreed to begin work on setting up a combined military unit to respond quickly to humanitarian disasters or security crises.The idea would draw in militaries from all countries represented at the South Pacific Defence Ministers' Meeting — Australia, Fiji, France, New Zealand, PNG, Tonga and Chile.Defence Minister Richard Marles said all those countries at the meeting were a ""family"" with ""an instinct to provide assistance and help when any of us need it, be that in a moment of natural disaster or be that in a moment of civil unrest or insecurity"".""The Pacific Response Group is really the next step in relation to that, which is to explore the idea of having a standing formed unit which would be there to provide assistance when invited to do so by a country,"" he said.Defence chiefs from all the countries at the meeting are expected to work together on a more detailed plan over the next year.Dr Anna Powles from Massey University said there were ""geopolitical drivers"" behind the proposal, ""including concerns about Chinese initiatives to develop a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief mechanism outside the existing regional mechanisms as well as concerns about China's growing network of security relationships across the Pacific"".""It is worrying that humanitarian assistance is increasingly becoming a site for strategic competition,"" she told the ABC.""It will also likely raise concerns about the increasing militarisation of humanitarian assistance in the Pacific Islands.""","Asia, Australia, Canberra, Chile, China, Defence Forces, Defence and National Security, Federal

When I try to write a song, the island reggae-type vibe comes through the music. From my Aboriginal side, a bit of rap,"" Fiula says.Another pillar in his life is his faith.The Havili family is practising Christian.Fiula says that the church community has helped make him feel secure.""I think it's actually influenced me a lot, because being Christian, we're brought up to have a lot of faith and having faith in God in life, I'm going to have faith in him through music and have faith in the process,"" he says.While the local high school offers music as a subject, Fiula still prefers to write and record his songs in the privacy of his bedroom.""The main place where I get all my ideas from is when I'm in my room by myself, where it's isolated from all the noise and I can just flow,"" he says.""It doesn't always have to be emotional. It can just be everyday things. Whenever I have any spare time, I try to get some music into it. I consistently try to write songs.""With his bedroom as his recording studio and a microphone propped up on the top shelf of his wardrobe, Fiula can relax and focus on the rhythm.It can be a time-consuming pursuit, according to his mum, with much of his free time dedicated to his craft.""We just let him go,"" she says.""His brother and sister will give a tap on the door when it's dinner time, but we just let him be for hours and hours.""When he is finally ready to show his family what he's been working on, his mum is once again struck by that feeling she had when he was five and dancing to the radio on their verandah in Menindee.""He comes out when he's ready and shows us what he's got and brings us to tears,"" she says. ","Broken Hill, Indigenous (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander), Indigenous Music, Menindee, Music (Arts and Entertainment), Regional Communities, Tonga, ",2023-12-02 04:04:49+00:00
4,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-22/australia-roving-pacific-cyber-experts-online-threats-grow/103135782,"The Australian government has announced it will set up roving teams of cyber experts to help Pacific Island nations deal with the growing online threats posed by criminal organisations and hostile states.Australian officials have become increasingly worried about the Pacific's vulnerability to cyber attacks, even as they face mounting questions about Australia's own capacity to deter criminal organisations and foreign governments targeting critical infrastructure, businesses and households across the country.Last year, Australian experts flew to Vanuatu to help the country deal with a ransomware attack that crippled many of its government departments, forcing some officials and hospital workers to resort to using pen and paper.Papua New Guinea was also hit with a ransomware attack in 2021 that targeted government pay systems, while Tonga's state-owned telecommunications company was hit earlier this year.Last month, Fiji's Deputy Prime Minister Manoa Kamikamica said cyber crime was an ""increasing threat to our administrations"" across the Pacific.""It is a sad fact that everyday, thousands of criminals go to work with the sole intention of inflicting harm on innocent people across the globe, including here in the Blue Pacific Continent,"" he said.""We cannot, and will not, let them win.""Now, the federal government has pledged $26 million under its new cyber security strategy to set up ""rapid assistance"" teams to ""help respond to cyber crises as they happen in the Pacific"".The teams will be led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but will also include experts from the private sector and specialists from intelligence agencies like the Australian Signals Directorate.The federal government has also devoted a further $16.7 million to help Pacific nations identify online vulnerabilities and trial solutions that can reduce the threat of online attacks.Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts told the ABC cyber attacks were the ""fastest growing threat"" to the Pacific's national security — just as they are in Australia.""As Pacific Island nations realise their economic ambitions and develop their connectivity, their exposure to that threat grows,"" he said.""So the Australian government knows we have to lift our engagement to ensure we consolidate our position as partner of choice for the Pacific family when it comes to building resilience to these threats.""But the government is also treading carefully, stressing that the ""rapid response teams"" will only be sent to Pacific Island countries that specifically request assistance from Australia.One government source told the ABC it was ""very conscious of sensitivities"" in the Pacific around sovereignty, including in the cyber space – pointing to the stalled security pact between Australia and Vanuatu.The prime minister who signed that deal before being later ousted, Ishmael Kalsakau, complained that social media ""misinformation"" about the deal had convinced some in Vanuatu that ""troops from Australia will enter the country without visas and access our sovereign data"".But Mr Watts said Australia had built up ""deep wells of trust"" with the Pacific governments by responding to requests for help in the wake of cyber attacks.""In the last 18 months there have been a number of very significant cyber incidents in the Pacific … and Australia's response to requests for assistance from countries like Tonga and Vanuatu, to name two, have been publicly acknowledged,"" he said.""And we want to strive to lift our engagement, to lift our investment, to build on that relationship of trust.""","Australia, Computer Science, Cyber Crime, Defence and National Security, Government and Politics, Information and Communication, Internet, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Science and Technology, Security Intelligence, Tonga, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2023-11-22 05:15:29+00:00
5,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-07/pacific-islands-forum-australia-climate-targets-under-microscope/103070152,"The idyllic Cook Islands is about to see a week of high-level diplomacy and multilateral wrangling as the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders meeting gets underway. Pacific leaders — including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese — will be treated to some magnificent natural treasures.They'll first descend on the beautiful, mountainous island of Rarotonga, 5,000 kilometres north-east of Sydney, a rainforest-covered, reef-fringed droplet in the heart of the South Pacific.After that, they'll fly another hour north for a day-long ""leaders retreat"" on the even more remote atoll of Aitutaki, which is blessed with white sands, palm trees and a stunning, electric blue lagoon of almost impossible beauty.Leaders will spend much of that time largely alone with each other, motoring gently around the lagoon in the Teariki Moana — a luxury boat styled to evoke traditional Polynesian ocean-going vessels — with barely an advisor in sight.The landscape is more than just a picturesque backdrop: it's also a powerful reminder of the fragility of the Pacific's natural beauty as the region grapples with an uncertain future, including the ravages of climate change, and an ever more volatile strategic outlook.Most Pacific nations have small populations and treasuries and, in many cases, may not have the raw power to dictate the future on their own terms. But it's still a future that will be shaped — in ways both large and small — by the decisions Pacific leaders make this week in the Cook Islands. The PIF is drawing ever more attention from the media and major powers, but many of the key players will be missing from this year's leaders meeting.  The prime ministers of Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Vanuatu will all be absent, and represented by more junior ministers.Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare is preoccupied with the Pacific Games, while Vanuatu's new Prime Minister Charlot Salwai is focused on trying to help his constituency recover from the devastation wrought by Cyclone Lola last month. Meanwhile, New Zealand doesn't have a new prime minister (yet) in the wake of elections last month — which means Aoterea will be represented by a bipartisan duo of caretaker Deputy Prime Minister Carmel Sepuloni and National veteran Gerry Brownlee.Papua New Guinea's PM James Marape told reporters on Monday night he was sending his deputy John Rosso as he was busy with the upcoming national budget and negotiating the re-opening of the Porgera mine.""Just because I don't attend, or Solomon Island's prime minister doesn't attend, in no way share or form undermines the solidarity of PIF,"" he said. Yet, his absence could well irk the PIF leadership, which must be watching the mounting tally of no-shows with some frustration.Still, the director of the Lowy Institute's Pacific Islands Program, Meg Keen, doesn't believe the long list of missing leaders shows the region is turning away from the forum as its key convening body.""The number of leaders missing the PIF has less to do with a lack of commitment to the PIF and more to do with the punishing number of international meetings and major power summits this year, as well as the very real need to respond to a climate crisis in Vanuatu and political pressures at home,"" she told the ABC. ""With the next international climate conference just weeks away, the PIF will be not only about regional agendas but also projecting their voices and climate concerns internationally.""Meanwhile, while some of the Pacific's main leaders stay away, sharp-elbowed larger powers will be back — possibly with a vengeance. This will be the first PIF leaders meeting since the COVID-19 pandemic to bring PIF ""dialogue partners"" back into the main events, and a host of nations will show up, from great powers to more marginal players.Dialogue partners were politely told to stay away from last year's leaders meeting in Fiji, largely because the Pacific wanted to focus on healing internal rifts and was wary of strategic competition intruding at a delicate moment.But this week, senior envoys from the United States, China, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore and a host of other countries will all be in Rarotonga, ready to push their priorities and build their influence in an increasingly contested region. As ever, Pacific leaders will have to walk a fine line: they'll welcome the extra attention and resources on the table but also want to ensure that dialogue partners don't soak up too much energy or stoke new divisions between Pacific nations.They might also be wary about being drawn into distant conflicts. Ukraine and Israel — two nations mired in war — are currently on the top of the list of countries asking to be admitted as dialogue partners to PIF. Senior officials say that for now, they've decided to put a freeze on new partners while they work out a new criterion to assess requests from countries keen to join the 21 already at the table. It's hard to remember a recent major Pacific gathering where climate change hasn't dominated the agenda, and this meeting will be no exception.Pacific leaders are becoming sick of saying it, but it doesn't detract from their sincerity or urgency: they see escalating climate change as a mortal challenge and the single greatest threat to the Pacific, particularly to low-lying islands that face the very real prospect of disappearing entirely in coming decades.Unsurprisingly, climate change also remains by far the trickiest terrain for Australia at the forum because it's the only PIF member (with the partial exception of New Zealand) which is a significant contributor to the looming catastrophe.Mr Albanese is expected to come with some climate commitments in hand, promising to plough significant amounts of money into some of the multilateral and regional funds that have been set up to help deal with the impacts of climate change. That's likely to include about $50 million for the Green Climate Fund and a substantially larger sum for the Pacific Resilience Facility. These announcements will draw warm and genuine applause, but Australia will still face some sharp questions about what it's doing to attack the root of the problem. The fact Australia continues to expand its coal and gas industries as the world approaches a climate tipping point is particularly frustrating to some Pacific politicians and advocates, who see evidence of criminal neglect and greed.""All financial help will be welcomed. But the Pacific elders and leaders have made clear it goes beyond money, to higher ambition and climate justice,"" Meg Keen tells the ABC. ""The Pacific is looking for strong action to mitigate climate change, including a clear commitment from Australia to act more strongly to reduce and phase out fossil fuels."" Australia hopes its push to co-host a major Conference of the Parties (COP) forum with Pacific island nations in 2026 will help blunt criticism and prove to the Pacific that it's serious about elevating their voices and priorities internationally. Pacific leaders have already endorsed that proposal, so it's hard to see them backing away from that now, even if they remain frustrated that Australian climate policies remain a world away from where they want them to be. But the pace of Pacific advocacy on climate means Australia will continue to face sharp questions at PIF leaders summits, and this year will be no exception. Right now, Pacific nations are rapidly endorsing a global campaign to rapidly phase out coal, oil and gas production called the Port Vila Call, and advocates have signalled that forum leaders will be asked to give it their formal backing this week as well.Australia will be asked to come on board as well, but the federal government is not going to do that: most observers expect it will instead simply endorse the ""ambition"" or the ""goals"" of the treaty, without explicitly backing it.That will bitterly disappoint some Pacific leaders, but it's not going to shock any of them. The brutal reality is that, unlike other PIF members, Australia's economy remains reliant on fossil fuels as both a source of energy and export income.Some Pacific leaders have made sympathetic noises about the scale and difficulty of the transition Australia faces: last month, Fiji's Mr Rabuka suggested the Pacific had to be realistic about how fast Australia could move to phase out fossil fuels. But other Pacific leaders and advocates will be much less forgiving and will see this decision as just more evidence that Australia's claims to Pacific ""family"" ring hollow when it comes to the region's most urgent threat.It might now be a hoary cliche to say that the Pacific has become a theatre for intensified strategic competition between great powers and bigger players — but it remains true. Australia, New Zealand and the United States are all working to stop China from inserting itself as a security partner in the region in the wake of Beijing's success in cementing police and security agreements with Solomon Islands.Pacific nations already endorsed a ""family first"" principle on security at the last PIF leaders meeting, making it clear that they'd prefer Pacific nations to call on other countries in the region (such as Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and PNG) if they need help keeping the peace.Australian officials regularly point to this as evidence that many Pacific Island nations are uneasy about China trying to establish itself as a security player in Solomon Islands and elsewhere, even if they don't say so explicitly.Some observers expect Australia to use the Cook Islands leaders meeting to try and embed this principle more deeply.""The Family First approach is never far from the lips of Australia's leaders. It gives Australia strategic advantage over China and cements its regional 'partner of choice' position,"" Ms Keen says.""Expect to see more moves to build integration. Meanwhile, China will continue to look for opportunities to broaden its security and development edge.""Pacific countries will keep leveraging competition to maximise gain.""Australia's also expected to introduce new ""Quality Infrastructure Principles"" for Pacific infrastructure that are aimed at boosting local content, and new safeguards to ensure major projects don't damage the environment or local communities. There's a clear geopolitical angle here, as well.There's much less talk in Canberra these days about Chinese-funded ""white elephants"" in the Pacific — at least in part because Beijing is now steering away from funding ""brash"" high-profile projects in the region.But Pacific Minister Pat Conroy has still made it clear that he's frustrated that Chinese state-owned enterprises are using low-ball bids to win major Pacific infrastructure contracts from multilateral institutions like the Asian Development Bank.Other critics have also accused Chinese companies of locking out local workers, damaging the environment or allowing costs to spiral. And while regional dynamics will remain front of mind, Pacific leaders will also discuss more distant and terrible conflicts, including Israel's war in Gaza.Several Pacific nations retain strong political and religious links with Israel and have been hesitant to join international demands for an immediate ceasefire. But that's also stirred domestic political controversy in some of those countries — particularly Fiji.Pacific leaders are expected to make some sort of statement on the crisis in Gaza, but, given the difficult terrain, it's likely to be worded very carefully. Finally, it will be worth watching what happens with the leadership of the PIF itself. Pacific leaders have now put the ""PIF split"" with Micronesia behind them, and Kiribati's unpredictable President Taneti Maamau is expected to join the gathering in Cook Islands this week after returning to the fold.But there have been rumbles all year about the man who Micronesians have chosen to replace Cook Islands local Henry Puna as the next PIF secretary-general: former Nauru president Baron Waqa.Some Pacific leaders have even suggested that Micronesian leaders might be willing to reconsider their choice. But nobody wants to risk reopening old wounds by pushing too hard, and, if Micronesian leaders decide to stick with their man, then Mr Waqa looks very likely to settle into the job at some point next year.The Lowy Institute's Ms Keen isn't making any firm predictions, but she's also playing down the chances of another twist in the tale.""At this point, it appears that Puna will step down, the new leader of the PIF will be endorsed. It is most likely to be the former president of Nauru, Waqa, as agreed earlier,"" she says. ""Surprises can happen but whoever the next leader is, it will be one from the North Pacific.""  ","Australia, Climate Change, Cook Islands, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Kiribati, New Zealand, Oceans and Reefs, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Politics and Government, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2023-11-06 19:42:03+00:00

It also has a small Muslim population of about 7 per cent, and a tiny Jewish population.   But despite the small population, its connection to Israel is strong. Fiji has long been one of the largest contributors of soldiers to UN peacekeeping missions in the Middle East region, and has a developing economic relationship with Israel.        Yet Reverend James Bhagwan, general-secretary of the Pacific Conference of Churches, told the ABC's Pacific Beat program Fiji's vote to side with Israel was a ""contradiction"".""How can we say we are working towards a region of peace when this humanitarian call for a ceasefire is voted against?"" he told the ABC's Pacific Beat program.On Israel, Dr Newton-Cain said it had been a ""small but quite significant actor"" in the Pacific region for quite a while. ""There's no question that Israel, or possibly the US, has sought to influence voting in the region,"" she said. ""And as we've seen, it's been successful in some cases and less so in others."" Tonga is another country that has a longstanding, and increasingly active, relationship with the US. Its Prime Minister, Siaosi Sovaleni, was asked this week whether its decision was made ""to impress"" aid donors such as the United States. ""We are not trying to impress anyone,"" he said. ""This was a sovereign decision made by the government of Tonga.""Dr Newton-Cain said on top of the geopolitical landscape there was no doubt the religious element — and Israel's increased engagement in the region — played a part in voting lines. ""We saw Papua New Guinea [last month] open an embassy in Jerusalem rather than Tel Aviv, and some of that is informed by quite Old Testament religious thinking,"" she said. ""There is a sense, including at the personal leadership level, a sense that supporting Israel is the right thing to do from a religious point of view, particularly if people's religious viewpoints are informed by that kind of Old Testament, Holy Land, way of thinking.""Dr Newton-Cain said that for some nations, part of supporting Israel was part of protecting the Holy Land.""As we know, people's religious views are very important in the Pacific,"" she said.In the early stages of the war in Gaza, hundreds of Pacific pilgrims were in Israel for the Feast of Tabernacles, with some of them part of the Australian government repatriation flights. Many were Solomon Islanders from the region of northern Malaita, where some communities subscribe to the theory that Malaitans descended from Hebrews.The connection was explored in a research paper written by former bishop Terry Brown, and published by the University of Trinity College of Toronto. In it, Mr Brown explores the ""intimate relationship"" with Jews, the Old Testament and the modern state of Israel with Solomon Islanders in the region. In the research, Mr Brown delves into the ""visions and teachings"" of Anglican leader George Umai, from northern Malaita, who led a lot of the theorising in the region. ""In his prophecies, Umai traced Malaitans, Solomon Islanders, and many other Oceanic peoples to his ancestors who he claimed fled from Jerusalem to Malaita,"" he wrote. ""According to Umai, they brought the Ark of the Covenant from the Jerusalem Temple to Kwara'ae, Malaita where they buried it."" Mr Umai died in 1998. But the connection to Israel continues today, with the Israeli flag a common sight in the province. Academic research has also been conducted into the theory that Fijians are part of a lost tribe of Israel. Anthropologist Lynda Newland wrote a paper on the genesis of the theory, which stems from what's known as the Kaunitoni Migration, which tells the story — first published in Western research in 1890 — about how three chiefs came ""from the West"" to Fiji's main two islands and beyond.  She writes: ""Over the course of the 20th Century, the narrative has been elaborated to claim Fijian origins in Lake Tanganyika in Eastern Afrika and the other more ancient connections with the Middle East.""Some also claim the Ark of the Covenant is buried on Mana Island, west of Nadi, while others say their forefathers had the ""covenant of circumcision"" when missionaries arrived and early Fijians had Egyptian wives.For Mika Mudreilagi, it is something he believes as part of his strong faith, but admits it's something researchers need to explore more.""It's a sign of our affiliation, of where the roots of our faith came from,"" he said. ""I would like the International Christian Embassy of Jerusalem to come here and look into it more. I think it's an important area to look into. ""But regardless, we are bound to Israel, [our hearts] are tied with Israel.""","Asia, Fiji, History, Israel, Judaism, Malaita, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Nauru, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Religion, Solomon Islands, Tonga, World Politics, ",2023-11-03 20:09:54+00:00

So basically, China is doing more with less.""And while donors committed a record-breaking $5.5 billion to the region in 2021, Mr Dayant said that sum was still short of what the Pacific needed.""This is still far from what the region needs in terms of funding — not just for classic development purposes, but also the negative consequence of climate change,"" he said.The Pacific Aid Map shows a sharp jump in finance for climate change-related projects, but Mr Dayant said many of them had only a loose connection to climate.""Funding for projects which really focus on climate mitigation and adaptation is actually pretty flat,"" he said.""More is needed in this space.

IARC has been calling for clearer and more certain pathways to permanent residency in Australia for Pacific Island nationals,"" he said.""We have found that people put their lives on hold for years, waiting for their name to essentially be picked out of a hat. The system needs to be better. People need certainty.""But the government maintains the ballot will ensure equitable access to Australia, and help to avoid a brain drain from the Pacific.Professor Stephen Howes from the Australian National University said the ballot system had functioned well for a similar visa scheme in New Zealand.""The New Zealand visa is popular and widely accepted, so it just makes eminent sense for Australia to follow the path New Zealand set,"" he told the ABC.Professor Howes said the timing of the legislation's passage would also work well for Labor ahead of a critical Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders meeting in Cook Islands in early November.""We're heading into the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting … and know the whole issue of visa-free access is going to be raised,"" he said.""It's not something Australia is prepared to concede, but Australia can point to this very significant initiative as a practical way in which it's making movement into Australia very much easier.""While some Pacific nations have privately raised some concerns that the Pacific Engagement Visa could exacerbate skills shortages in the region, some high-profile Pacific politicians have enthusiastically backed the proposal.Fiji's Deputy Prime Minister Biman Prasad told the ABC that the visa would promote business investment between Australia and the Pacific, as well as ""allowing ideas and innovation to move from one country to another.""""In a broader sense, this is part of a broader strategy to integrate the region in the long term,"" he said.""And given the geopolitics as well, uniting the region in this way will benefit the whole of the region.""He also dismissed anxieties about the visa feeding into a brain drain in the Pacific.""There's a thinking that everyone will suddenly pack their bags, but that won't happen,"" he told the ABC.""In fact, it may create an environment where people feel the opportunity is there and there will be more stability.""The government still wants to pass separate legislation through parliament which would give Pacific Engagement Visa holders access to additional welfare benefits.It is vowing to open the program in the first half of next year, which will allow the first visa holders to settle in Australia later in 2024.Pat Conroy said the federal government was still working out exactly how the 3,000 spots would be split between different Pacific countries.""We're working through what we disclose but I think there are strong reasons for the country allocations to be made public,"" he said.The minister said the places would be allocated ""broadly but not completely"" in line with the populations of various countries, and that Australia would make sure Pacific nations were ""comfortable"" with their allocations.He also said some of the 13 Pacific countries eligible for the scheme might not take part until the second year.""There are some countries which are very enthusiastic and want to be part of the early rollout, and there are others that have said they will take a step back and be part of the second year,"" he said.Professor Howes said it was a potentially transformative moment in Australia's relationship with the Pacific.""This is the first time we've had a Pacific window into not our temporary migration program, but our permanent migration program,"" he told the ABC.""It certainly puts the Pacific at a very elevated status.""","Australia, Farm Labour, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Immigration, Immigration Policy, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Nauru, New Zealand, Pacific, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trade, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Work, World Politics, ",2023-10-19 05:53:21+00:00

And in the past, his firearms were used solely for his work around the property.But over the past few years, he says they've become an integral part of protecting his family.""I feel secure having a firearm,"" he said. ""There have been a lot of robberies in our neighbourhood. It's getting worse every day, that's why I sleep with a gun at arm's reach."" And Mr Sanft is not alone. In Tonga — like most Pacific countries — guns are not a common sight. Yet sentiment is changing, and many Tongans the ABC spoke to are softening their stance on the issue.Tonga has a longstanding connection with the United States; more than 65,000 people with Tongan heritage live in the country. Some in the community say more violent crimes and drug use in the small island nation are forcing them to take the US approach. They're getting armed — both legally and illegally.  ""We see the [gun] problem in the bigger countries,"" Tonga's Deputy Police Commissioner Tevita Vailea told the ABC.""We don't want Tonga to be a part of that problem.""Yet, some Tongans are doing it regardless. The ABC is aware of a small underground black market for guns circulating in the community, with some families —   and criminals —  deciding to take matters into their own hands.Deputy Commissioner Tevita Vailea said police were aware of the trend and were cracking down on those involved.""In terms of allowing people to have firearms for self-defence purposes, we do not support that,"" he said.""There's a link between illegal firearms and organised crime. But also, we're seeing a lot of accidents involving firearms. [There is a] lack of duty of care, and we've seen people lose family members due to accidental death.""It is not easy to legally own a gun in Tonga. Nuku'alofa's district officer Taisi Takau told the ABC each applicant had to be a ""reliable person"", endorsed by a local reverend from the applicant's village, or they must have a farm or livestock.Mr Takau checks each applicant in the capital, to make sure they're appropriate. ""It's very important to seriously oversee each applicant, it is not something to be taken lightly.""Then it is up to the police, with the minister for police having absolute authority to accept or reject each individual's application.Yet despite the tight checks, police say more firearms are circulating around Tonga as the black market grows.Even Tonga's royal family has weighed in, with Prince Tu’ipelehake telling the ABC some people were over the length of time it took the government to approve firearm licences. He suggested some people might be bringing in guns to the country not intending to break the law. ""Like most people here in Tonga, the frustration on waiting on completion of government procedures and approval for months on end might be easier to go ahead, bring it in whilst simultaneously trying to get a licence,"" he said.Local police have cracked down on the practice.Over the past five years, they've confiscated more than 2,000 illegal firearms, kept at the police station in the capital Nuku'alofa. It's a large number, considering only 106,000 people permanently live in Tonga.He said a lack of protection around its border was a problem. According to a recent report by the Lowy Institute, Tonga, along with other Pacific nations, is targeted by drug cartels as an intermediary into New Zealand and Australia.  And weapons are becoming a part of that trade, with the Tongan Attorney-General's Office revealing 70 per cent of drug raids in Tonga recover weapons. According to Tonga's head of customs Michael Cokanasiga, insider jobs are a problem.Last month, a customs officer was arrested for allegedly attempting to smuggle nine rifles, two shotguns, a pistol and more than 4,000 rounds of ammunition into the country.But with the new X-ray machines at the port, customs officers say they have confiscated more illegal firearms. ""With the machines, we can find basically anything,"" Mr Cokanasiga said. ""We've recently intercepted approximately 1kg of methamphetamine, originating from the United States""Back at Mr Sanft's farm, he proudly wears a hat with the American flag whilst doing his chores around the farm. For him, the equation is simple: he thinks more Tongans should own guns to help keep burglars and intruders away from their homes.""The government should allow us to shoot intruders,"" he said.""Not to kill, but just to injure, before the police arrive.""","Armed Robbery, Burglary, International Courts and Tribunals, Law, Crime and Justice, Pacific, Police, Tonga, ",2023-10-17 21:01:29+00:00

Windows are cracked, paint is peeling, and engines are kept working by the ingenuity of the drivers.In 2020, Saimone Vuki grew frustrated with the sight of broken-down cars rusting outside of homes.At the time, there was no officially designated site for car waste in the country so he started actively collecting scrap cars from around the island.""Our mission is to try and remove [the scrap cars] from the homes and bring it to one place,"" he says.That place is down a dirt road lined with palm trees and taro plants.  Here, on 8 acres of Saimone's land, thousands of cars are stacked in long zig-zagging avenues of rusted metal.  It's Tonga's main car dump, and it holds at least 2,000 abandoned vehicles.""I would love to grow some crops here, but I would rather do this than let all this scrap metal stay with the people at their homes,"" Mr Vuki says.Mr Vuki isn't only worried about the 30,000 cars already in the environment, but also the estimated tens of thousands more that will follow in the years ahead. He's started the Tongan Recycling Association, an organisation made up of individuals and private companies who support reducing, reusing, and recycling waste in Tonga.The organisation wants recycling to be thought about from the moment cars and other consumer goods are imported — so they don't pile up as waste.""We want every project here in Tonga to have a recycling component where at the end of the project they have to ship out all those materials they send to Tonga,"" he says.Fortunately, Tonga has a track record of managing other big waste problems.Over the past two decades, it's made massive improvements to the way it's handled a new problem: household waste.For most of the last century, household waste management was largely a foreign concept in Tonga.The reason for this was simple: there was little waste. Most people lived in small rural communities, made up of simple houses surrounded by taro and vegetable farms.The small economy meant there were few imported consumer goods or materials that didn't easily degrade, such as plastic. Then, as the economy grew, the rubbish piled up. By the early 2000s, it had become a major problem.Heaps of trash had accumulated next to villages. People burnt the waste at roadsides or let it flush out to sea.The government took action, passing the country's first waste management act.In 2005, Tongans began waking up to a new sound, one that was already familiar to many people in other countries.It was the morning rattle and thud of the weekly rubbish collection.Almost 20 years on, the rubbish collection service has been a success, concentrating thousands of tonnes of waste that could have ended up littering the environment.There are now public rubbish bins along the foreshore and the beachfront is clean and tidy. But this success hasn't solved the problem of waste generation.The household rubbish collected by the government is taken to a publicly owned dump, built in 2005 in the dead centre of Tongatapu, called the Tapuhia landfill.According to Stalin Naufahu, the head of special projects at Waste Authority Limited, the public enterprise to manage Tonga's waste, Tapuhia is receiving more rubbish than ever.""We're seeing a huge increase of waste that's being generated from residential households,"" he says.""As consumption increases ... that means more waste.""Standing on the edge of the landfill, he points to a pit that was meant to be gradually filled with rubbish over 10 years.After six years, it's already overflowing.Mr Naufahu worries that sites like this one won’t be able to keep up with the current rate of consumption.""We track the amount of imports coming in because it's almost a guarantee that everything that's being imported into the country will become waste eventually.""One solution might be more intensive recycling of waste, including outsourcing this work to the private sector.""The overall plan is to shift away from doing everything ourselves and empower all these local recycling businesses.""Recycling cans and bottles can be done locally, but repurposing abandoned cars is more difficult.And as Mr Naufahu points out, the clunkers are piling up. Each year, 2,000 vehicles are abandoned.In many cases, these cars were imported second-hand, which meant they ended up being abandoned relatively quickly.Meanwhile, the accumulating car waste is harming the environment.""There are concerns regarding the chemicals within the vehicles leaking out into the environment as it rusts over time,"" Mr Naufahu says.""The main concern is leachate from the vehicles leaking and affecting underground water systems.""Mr Naufahu says the problem is an urgent one.""We have to move now.""In response, the government is looking at two separate solutions.The first is a policy that prohibits cars over 15 years old being imported so that these imported cars last longer on the roads.But this is facing backlash from the public, who say it will make buying a car more expensive.The other solution is more ambitious: shipping abandoned cars back to Japan, where they mostly came from.To do this, it has received funding from Japan to build a scrap vehicle recycling centre, due to open later this year.Here, compactors will crush cars into neat one-metre-by-one-metre cubes, to be exported for scrap metal recycling.Teams will travel around the country looking for scrap vehicles and getting permission from owners to include them in the recycling operation.It's hoped compacting and recycling will gradually thin out Tonga's car graveyards.The mountains of abandoned cars are an imposing challenge, but Mr Naufahu is optimistic about the future.This isn't just wishful thinking, he says, but grounded in the improvements he's seen in Tonga's waste management over the past 20 years.The country has gone from ""people dumping waste in their backyards"" to having centralised rubbish collection.Twenty years from now, he says, it may have solved the issue of car waste.Other Pacific island nations face similar problems with increasing refuse and high costs to remove large waste. Mr Naufahu hopes they may follow Tonga's lead.""We're hoping what the other Pacific countries can learn from is that you don't have to wait for help to come before you start taking the initiative,"" he says.","Environment, Environmental Impact, Environmental Management, Offbeat, Pacific, Plastics, Polymers and Rubber Manufacturing, Pollution, Recycling and Waste Management, Tonga, ",2023-09-18 20:00:00+00:00

You think about your family everyday, you miss them.""    The song is one of Fiji's biggest hits this year.""It was hard to write, I had my own experience working there.""It's slang, Ilavo ni Aussie Ilavo Mosimosi, it's what Fijians say when they're out there working on the farms.  ""It's big money, out there, but it's tough work."" The PALM scheme concept itself dates back to 2007, then known as the Seasonal Worker Program. When COVID hit, Australia's once-reliable source of seasonal labour, backpackers, evaporated and the agricultural sector turned to the Pacific.Thousands of Pacific Islanders streamed into the country, and the program has been expanding rapidly, with workers now able to work in Australia for nine months to four years.  ""I think it's the ultimate win-win,"" Minister for the Pacific Pat Conroy told the ABC.   ""Australia benefits by having our labour shortages filled by some of our closest neighbours, the workers win by picking up much needed skills and [on average] send home $15,000 per year."" Whilst the vast majority of employers and workers say the scheme is mutually beneficial, it has been dogged with persistent stories of exploitation around the accommodation provided, the work itself and services provided by employees.Pacific Islanders themselves have often struggled with the adaption required to work in Australia, while absconding has long been an issue.  And with its rapid expansion, it is causing major social issues in Pacific countries, with the ABC hearing dozens of stories of broken marriages and strained relationships because of the scheme.  In Fiji, there's even slang associated with extramarital affairs, with the word ""lasa tuba"" abbreviated to ""Aussie LT"" meaning the ""other partner"" in Australia.  In the Pacific the exodus to Australia is causing major headaches.  Pacific leaders raise it regularly, with Samoa's prime minister recently stating it was rivalling climate change as the ""number one"" issue the country faced. She said countries like hers should not been seen merely as ""outposts"" which ""grow"" labourers for developed nations. As of July 31, 38,259 Pacific Islanders were working in Australia through the scheme, down from a record of almost 40,000 in June. At the start of the year the figure was around 20,000.The Australian government wants the scheme to grow and has pushed back on criticisms that it is causing brain drain, saying Pacific leaders had the power to control or cap how many workers they allowed overseas. In a country like Tonga, the workers make up a staggering 6 per cent of the total population of the country.According to business owners in Tonga it is creating gaping holes in the workforce.""My turnover is too numerous to count,"" Tanoa Hotel Tonga manager Jason Strickland told the ABC. ""It's not equated to poor management, it's equated to people leaving overseas in big groups and I'm sure other businesses are experiencing this.""Essentially I feel like I'm running a hotel school.""     Mr Strickland said he had ""no issue"" with people moving to chase better opportunities.     He said the problem was highly-qualified staff moving overseas because the money was better, meaning, ironically, he's had to turn to other countries to fill the void.  ""I don't think the answer is for businesses to stamp their feet and ask these schemes to stop, I think they're here to stay,"" he said. ""But If you are going to take my chefs or my receptionists or my front office staff overseas and give them opportunities, I think they would be better suited in hotels and restaurants, rather than meat packing and agriculture.""The issue has extended to Tonga's major hospital. Nurse manager Meleinu Felise said as well as moving overseas to work in the aged-care sector, some nurses were opting to work in Australia picking fruit.   ""As we all know, nurses are moving around because of better pay 'on the other side',"" she said. ""They're looking for a better life.""But they say they want to come back, and they will come back, because their families are here. As we all know, in Tonga, we have obligations.  ""I hate to say it [but] if worse comes to worse, we'll get overseas workers, Pacific Islanders, to come and do a month here.""Back in Fiji, Nai Misipeka and her five children have learnt to adapt without their husband and father. The children do more in the garden and Nai brings in help from the community where she can.    The money John has made through the scheme has enabled them to lay-buy a new washing machine — the rest has gone on food. But, with another three years of work ahead, they have plans to build an extension on their home.""The money is good, but the important thing to us is our children,"" she said.""I want us, my family, to go to Australia [for the duration of his work] and support my husband. As soon as he's finished, we come back."" The Australian government has recognised this, introducing a ""trial"" of 200 long-term PALM scheme workers being able to bring their families to Australia.  Mr Conroy said he recognised for some families the separation was ""tough"".""[The trial] is aimed at dealing with that dislocation impact being reported to us,"" Mr Conroy said. ""And we have to work with communities to make sure it's in their interests to participate.   ""But overwhelmingly [this] has been positive for the Pacific, this is helping people out of poverty, and that's why it's so important.""With her husband still months away from a short trip home for Christmas, Nai has a message for him.  ""John, we will always love you.

As the debris sloshed up and down the valley walls, it dragged the snapped cable five kilometres across the bottom of the ocean with it.While this severed almost all contact between Tonga and the rest of the world, the time at which the cables were damaged also let researchers calculate the speed of the debris flows.The fastest travelled up to 122kph.The study gives an idea of just how quickly underwater debris flows triggered by submarine volcanoes are capable of travelling, said Rebecca Carey, a volcanologist at the University of Tasmania who wasn't involved in the research.It also highlights the risk for countries, such as Tonga, which are surrounded by volcanoes just like Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai.""When these volcanic eruptions or underwater landslides occur, it's those south-west Pacific nations that are most severely affected because their communications can go out,"" Dr Carey said.""Without those communication cables, the response to volcanic eruption is delayed. For instance, we didn't know what happened in Tonga for three days.""Unsurprisingly, the debris flows annihilated any marine ecosystems in their path.Before the 2022 eruption, coral reefs, rich with life, thrived on the volcano's slope, Mr Mackay said.""But when we went [to the site three months after the eruption], there was nothing left where those flows touched.""Those density currents just removed all life.""Even as far as 60km from the blast zone, to where the international cable was destroyed, the researchers didn't spot a single sign of life — not even footprints left by a crab scuttling across the seabed.But life, as we know, finds a way.Mr Mackay said the researchers plan to return every couple of years and document the species that return and establish in the currently desert-like swathes of sea floor.""If you remove all life in an area, what life is going to go back first, what does the ecosystem look like as life recovers?""Mr Mackay and his colleagues discovered corals, anemones and schools of fish flourishing on neighbouring seamounts and volcanoes where the blast debris didn't reach.Those species may well repopulate the area around Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai, he said.""So the chances are it probably will be the same ecosystem that will come back.""But we may see a completely new ecosystem that sets up, one that's completely different to what was there before.""","Earth Sciences, Emergency Incidents, Geology, Science and Technology, Tonga, Volcanic Eruptions, ",2023-09-07 19:00:00+00:00

But the cold weather?

And at some points it'll go down to 15. But to go down to 10. This [is] a first for me.""It got so cold the prison [and] the psychiatric ward were asking for blankets . . . so Her Royal Highness with the help of Her Majesty donated some.""The cold temperatures in parts of the region come as intense heatwaves hit southern Europe, South-East Asia, northern Africa, the United States and South America.They smashed records and fuelled wildfires in Greece, Spain, Italy, Canada and Algeria.In July, 21 of the 30 hottest days on record led to it becoming Earth's hottest month on average.And in Australia, parts of the eastern states are experiencing unseasonably warm weather, partly due to interactions with the weather events bringing chilly conditions to parts of the Pacific.Tonga's location near the edge of the tropics, a developing El Niño event and a weather system that has channelled air from south of the country have likely helped drive the colder temperatures.""The major factor in this case will be the flow of air from further south coming up into this region bringing cooler temperatures,"" Professor Janette Lindesay from the ANU's Fenner School of Environment and Society told the ABC.It's also helping to keep the skies clear.""When you've got clear skies like that, at night the heat that's absorbed at the Earth's surface during the day when the sun's shining escapes, so it cools down overnight,"" Professor Lindesay said.The record cold day Tonga experience in 1994 was during an El Niño that lasted until the next year.Professor Lindesay said it was hard to know if Tonga would continue to face chilly winters in the coming years.If the developing El Niño continued into a moderate or strong El Niño, it would likely bring a period of below average rainfall and lower night-time temperatures.That can lead to things like droughts and severe frosts, which can kill food crops.Professor Lindesay said a severe frost hit Papua New Guinea in spring in 1997, devastating staple food crops.""There was a lack of food in that area and there were some real sociological problems and issues for the people at that time,"" she said.The conditions in Tonga are being felt across the region, with puffer jackets and beanies being seen in Fiji and colder temperatures recorded in Samoa.Samoa Meteorological Services assistant chief executive Afaese Dr Luteru Tauvale said Samoa's average maximum temperature was around 28C or 29C.He said some places near the capital were hitting the low 20s this week.  He said the lowest minimum temperature on record was 10C, which the country had not got close to hitting this year so far. But he said, they were still ""on the hunt"" to gain accurate temperatures across Samoa and its more remote areas. ""In the past some of the villages have called in and they told us they'd seen frost so, you know, we're still wanting to get instruments out there to record that.""As the world continued to feel the impacts of climate change, Dr Tauvale said predicting weather patterns in the region would become more ""complicated"".   ""We've seen a complete change of climate and weather patterns,"" he said.""You know, we are in a transition.

But it really hurt the Diamonds' stats, who finished the quarter with just 39 per cent possession, 14 penalties to Tonga's nine and a poor conversion rate.With the game evenly poised, fans hoped the contest would continue to rumble, but after such an impressive start, Tonga Tala unravelled.The Diamonds very much approached the second period as a clean slate and came out flying to score 10 goals straight through the likes of Cara Koenen and Austin.Klau had already got a couple of tips on the ball in the opening quarter, but by now she was raring to go and wearing Tala shooter Marie Hansen like a glove.Four minutes in, sensing her team were faltering, Pori-Makea-Simpson injected Tuivaiti into the match at goal shooter, while shifting Hansen to wing attack and Palavi to goal attack.Tuivaiti, now 36, is always a difficult player to mark due to her unrivalled flair and unpredictability.Throughout her 33 minutes on court, the veteran did her best to play an unorthodox hybrid of a moving and holding circle, supporting the younger players.Sometimes her efforts to try and act as a third feeder and set up Palavi worked; other times the Tala midcourters were not quite ready for the no-look pass to come their way.Tonga went on to concede 30 more turnovers across the final three quarters and score just 25 goals to Australia's 70. Overall, it was a flat finish after a promising contest.Most of Tonga's difficulty came at the centre-pass, where the Diamonds did a good job at holding back their attackers, panicking Tala and forcing them to look back to their defenders.Sometimes they were able to get out of jail free with this method – at half-time wing defence Lucia Fauonuku had more centre-pass receives than anyone else (seven) – but other times Austin and Watson forced their defenders wide and pounced on the desperate play.With a healthy lead at half-time, 38-19, the Diamonds were well and truly in the box seat and Marinkovich was able to repeat a similar pattern to the substitutions she made against Zimbabwe.Once again we saw five changes in this main break, with a completely different shooting combination running out for the third quarter as Sophie Garbin and Steph Wood paired up in the circle.Jo Weston and Sunday Aryang brought fresh legs at goal defence and wing defence, while Paige Hadley – after a cracking performance on day one – came on with energy to burn at wing attack.Despite the wholesale changes, the third quarter was the quickest and slickest of the match.Vice-captain Wood, in her 50th game for Australia, worked beautifully as the linchpin that held the Diamonds front-end together. Driving into space and luring her defender, she created a safe passage for the pass to come into Garbin under the post.Hadley in wing attack was another welcome change, sending in rocket feeds to catch the opposition defenders off guard. She has been perhaps the most consistent and reliable player for Australia across their first two games of the tournament so far.The ball speed and quick thinking of these two players kept Tala out of the contest, unable to pinch a single bit of ball in the last half.Speaking with ABC Sport, Iongi said the side was still trying to find their rhythm as they made the step up to the World Cup stage.""The first quarter was a great example of what we can do, I reckon if we replicate what we did there across the game that we can give a lot of these teams a run for their money,"" she said.""We're all young, it's good experience. A lot of us have looked up to these Diamonds girls and wanted to be like them in the green and gold dress at some point, so it was cool to play against them.""Commenting on the breakdown in connections up front, Iongi also conceded Tala were still trying to figure out how to play alongside the flair of legend Tuivaiti.""In a way, she doesn't play like a regular shooter, she has all these tricks and you never know when the ball is coming,"" Longi said.""So I think we've got to stay ready for those balls and although the attackers have worked on that, I think we're still trying to fit her in.""On day three of the World Cup, the Australians face Fiji — who sit second in Group A with a better for-and-against percentage than Tonga — but they will be keeping one eye on England as the Roses are set to be their toughest challenge in the second stage of the preliminary rounds.","Australia, Netball, Sport, Tonga, ",2023-07-29 12:44:26+00:00
17,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-07-22/china-us-powerplay-in-the-pacific-intensifies/102633474,"In 2012, Hilary Clinton smiled at Pacific leaders gathered in Rarotonga's cavernous National Auditorium and delivered a rehearsed and soothing line.The US Secretary of State told the assembly all nations, including the United States and China, had an ""important stake"" in the region's prosperity and security.She stressed the importance of Beijing being ""transparent"" in the Pacific, but her overall message was about boosting cooperation to help island nations prosper.""I think, after all, the Pacific is big enough for all of us,"" she told leaders with a smile.More than a decade later, that well-meaning bromide looks optimistic.Washington and Beijing are engaged in an increasingly fierce arm wrestle for diplomatic and technological supremacy, and the risk is growing that the Pacific becomes a vector for that contest.The very fact secretary Clinton was in the Cook Islands at all in 2012 — attending as a dialogue partner for the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting — was an early sign that the United States was intent on reasserting its influence in the region after decades of near neglect.But if the Obama administration's Pacific tilt was largely talk, President Joe Biden's has been intent on action.Last year, the administration hosted a landmark presidential summit with Pacific leaders at the White House, and US officials say they are planning a repeat this September.The United States is now reopening embassies throughout the Pacific, expanding its aid program, ramping up US Coastguard operations in the region, and unveiling a host of initiatives — sometimes with partners — which it says will help the region tackle its mounting list of threats, from climate change to illegal fishing.The US also promised to triple funding for the South Pacific Tuna Treaty, which could funnel some $US600 million ($850 million) to Pacific nations over the next decade — although so far the money remains locked up in lengthy budget negotiations in a deeply polarised Congress.The diplomatic flurry shows no sign of slowing.This week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will land in Tonga to formally open a new diplomatic mission in the capital.His counterpart, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, will land in Port Moresby around the same time, to discuss the implementation of a wide-ranging and contentious Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCI) that the US and Papua New Guinea signed in May.It's not just about strategic denial. But there's no doubt that Washington has been moving with more urgency and purpose in the wake of China striking a security pact with Solomon Islands last year — a move which sent shock waves through both Washington and Canberra.Since then, China has rapidly stepped up police cooperation with Solomon Islands, much to the unease of the West.And while Chinese development assistance to the region has fallen away, Beijing has intensified efforts to court Pacific political elites, while Chinese companies with deep networks in the region continue to win major infrastructure projects bankrolled by multinational organisations like the Asian Development Bank.Meanwhile, Chinese diplomats in the region are also making increasingly confident claims about being an exemplar and model for Pacific development, despite Pacific leaders making it crystal clear last year that they were not ready to sign a sweeping trade and security pact with Beijing.In May this year, China's Ambassador to Solomon Islands told the Global Times that Pacific island nations had struggled with ""development stagnation"" because they had adopted ""Westernised"" political models in the wake of colonisation.""The great practice of Chinese modernisation abandons the old Western modernisation path and provides a new modernisation reference model for PICs, providing a Chinese solution to achieve long-term stability and eradicate extreme poverty,"" he said.As Australian academic Graeme Smith observed this week, both state-owned and private Chinese companies are now increasingly being forced to ""carry geopolitical water"" and prosecute Beijing's interests — like when the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) lobbied Solomon Islands to abandon diplomatic ties with Taiwan.""China is now a serious player in the region with a development philosophy to sell,"" he wrote in the Conversation.""It's no longer enough to read Beijing's talking points. You have to look like you mean it.""It's not only the United States and China, of course.A quick glance at the list of visitors to Papua New Guinea in just the last three months gives you a clear sense of just how many players are now intent on building up their political stocks in the blue Pacific — which keeps the red-carpet runners at Port Moresby's APEC terminal increasingly busy.UK Foreign Affairs Secretary James Cleverly travelled to Papua New Guinea in April to sign a renewed Status of Forces Agreement in Port Moresby.Less than one month later, PNG also hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Antony Blinken, along with NZ Prime Minister Chris Hipkins and almost a dozen Pacific Island leaders.The country backed it up again earlier this month with Indonesian President Joko Widodo.And by the end of next week, both Lloyd Austin and French President Emmanuel Macron can be added to that long catalogue.Macron's main focus will be spending time in the French territory of New Caledonia, which is grappling with complex and fraught political issues around independence and the status of its ties with Paris.But Macron will then travel on to Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu — the first time a French president has left home soil while in the region — to promote what his office has called a ""French alternative"" to the brewing contest between Washington and Beijing.Meanwhile, Mr Austin will be firmly focused on defence ties and shoring up the defence cooperation — which might still face a tricky path through PNG's parliament and legal system.PNG Prime Minister James Marape has faced hurdles in selling the agreement at home, and PNG's opposition leader is seeking legal advice for a possible Supreme Court challenge.The Lowy Institute's Mihai Sora said the DCA ""came at some expense to Prime Minister Marape domestically"".""Secretary Austin will be looking to reinforce the US's interest in contributing to PNG's security needs and to increase local support for the DCA so that it passes through the Papua New Guinean system,"" he said.The deal might also come at some expense to Canberra, even though it has been officially welcomed by the federal government.Mr Marape's struggle to sell the US defence agreement is also contributing to delays with Australia's proposed Bilateral Security Treaty with PNG, which was already meant to be finalised and signed.In that way, the DCA also serves as a neat reminder that while Canberra is very glad to see Washington re-engaged in the Pacific, the two nations do not always have identical interests.If it's approved, the agreement will firm up a possible military foothold for the United States at key bases in Papua New Guinea — although the Pentagon and Mr Marape have been at pains to stress that it does not specifically authorise a permanent US presence in the country.""It's important to remember that the [DCA] will respect PNG sovereign decisions,"" a Pentagon spokesperson said this week.""All activities must be mutually agreed upon.""But the deal will inevitably still feed into existing anxieties throughout the Pacific that strategic competition between the West and China — as well as other players — risks driving a rapid militarisation of the region.And perhaps nowhere is that anxiety more acute than in Papua New Guinea's neighbour, Solomon Islands.Manasseh Sogavare was in a pugnacious mood on Monday when he landed back in Honiara from a week-long trip to China.The Solomon Islands prime minister once again berated Australia and the US for questioning his country's growing police cooperation with China, including a police ""implementation plan"" he signed while in Beijing.He also angered Australian officials by accusing both Australia and New Zealand of mysteriously ""delaying"" direct budget support and putting the Solomon Islands budget in a precarious position — an allegation both Canberra and Wellington have denied outright.The stoush created plenty of headlines, but a throwaway comment by the prime minister near the end of the press conference might prove to have much more consequence over the long term.Mr Sogavare gave the clearest public indication yet that he wants to push ahead with developing an armed forces, declaring that the 1,500-strong Royal Solomon Islands Police Force was simply too small to guarantee either internal or external security for the country.He also revealed he had ""sounded out"" Australia's Deputy Prime Minister, Richard Marles, about the idea during Mr Marles' visit to Honiara a few weeks ago.The timing was probably no accident. Mr Sogavare has mused in the past about getting China to help him set up a military, and Australia will be desperate to ensure that does not happen.When he was asked about Mr Sogavare's comments a few days later, Mr Marles declared that Australia would be ""very keen"" to help Solomon Islands if it decided to press ahead with the plan.That's likely to take Australia into a very fraught space.Any move to set up a standing Solomon Islands army would likely prove deeply contentious in the Pacific Island which has been repeatedly roiled by ethnic strife and violence, and which already lacks the money to properly fund health and education services.Some civil society groups and Pacific officials have already expressed deep concern about the idea in private.It's likely to split opinion in the Canberra bureaucracy as well.Anna Powles from Massey University said Mr Marles was probably intent on both denying China a role in any military set-up in Solomon Islands and ""managing alliance expectations with the US"".""Recent talk of standing up militaries in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu has been doing the rounds for months and has intensified over the past year with US and Chinese security assistance on offer in the region,"" she wrote on Twitter.""Canberra will need to tread very carefully.""But the episode also shows how Mr Sogavare — for all his bluster and braggadocio — has proven very adept at leveraging Australia's anxiety about China to get what he wants.Whether that chimes with what people in Solomon Islands want and need is a separate question.And the risk is that as the geopolitical contest intensifies, that distinction blurs or disappears entirely.And even Pacific leaders who are also skilfully navigating the same shoals with nothing but the interests of their people in mind face growing risks as global tensions rise.""The Pacific is well and truly in the mix as the US and China vie for global strategic primacy,"" the Lowy Insitute's Mihai Sora said.""The US is alliance-building across the Indo-Pacific and openly calls for support to uphold the global rules-based order.""China downplays its strategic intent; it does not telegraph its moves, but it is pursuing the largest military build-up in history and opportunistically looking to expand its strategic reach, including into the Pacific.""With opportunity comes risk, and plenty of snares and pitfalls which are not easily dodged.And as the competition ramps up, with ever more outside players clamouring for a spot in the vast Pacific, the margin for error grows more narrow.","Australia, Defence and National Security, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, United States, World Politics, ",2023-07-21 20:58:56+00:00
18,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-07-19/australia-happy-to-support-solomon-islands-defence-force/102622652,"Defence Minister Richard Marles has declared Australia would be ""very keen"" to help Solomon Islands set up its own defence force and says the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu was also thinking about establishing a military.Only three Pacific Island nations — Tonga, Papua New Guinea and Fiji — currently maintain standing militaries.But Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said on Monday that he had ""sounded out"" Mr Marles about potentially setting up its own defence force when they held talks late last month in Honiara.Mr Sogavare has repeatedly complained about Solomon Islands' dependence on outside forces to help maintain stability and has argued the 1,500-strong Royal Solomon Islands Police Force was too small to guarantee security.Mr Marles said it was a ""decision for Solomon Islands"" on whether it should push ahead with the idea, and that Australia would not ""express a view"" either way.But he said Australia would be a ""natural partner of choice"" for Solomon Islands if it did decide to press ahead.""What was indicated to me by the prime minister is that this is a path that Solomon Islands is interested in walking down,"" he told the ABC's Afternoon Briefing.""And in that event, Australia is very keen to play its part in partnering with Solomon Islands in the development of their defence force.""And we have experience in terms of what we do with Fiji defence force, the PNG defence force, Tonga defence force.""Mr Marles also said Vanuatu was similarly ""thinking about moving down this path"" — although he did not provide any further details.At the moment, Vanuatu maintains only a small ""Mobile Force"" that helps police maintain order, but which is meant to provide a ""first line of defence against external aggression"" if the country faces a military threat.Mr Marles suggested he wanted to ensure Australia was the country Pacific nations turned to if they wanted to expand their military capability.""We bring a lot of experience to bear but I think the real fundamental point is that we seek to be the natural partner of choice for Solomon Islands and indeed all the countries in the Pacific,"" he said.The idea of setting up a military is likely to be deeply controversial in Solomon Islands, which was riven by ethnic turmoil from the late 1990s, when order broke down and both armed militias and police engaged in widespread crime and violence.Armed police also launched a coup in 2000, before the Australian-led RAMSI intervention restored order in July 2003 — departing only in 2017.Australian police and ADF personnel returned to the country in 2021 when Honiara was once again roiled by rioting and violence, and Mr Sogavare turned to Australia for assistance to re-establish stability.It is not the first time that Mr Sogavare has mused publicly about the idea of setting up a military.In 2019, he told the Little Red Podcast that one of the reasons why he wanted to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China was because Beijing would be able to help Solomon Islands stand up its own defence forces.Security analysts said the Australian government — which was already anxious about expanding police ties between China and Solomon Islands — was determined to do everything possible to stop any military cooperation between Beijing and Honiara.But Dr Meg Keen from the Lowy Institute said the key question for Australia was ""where the best return on effort lies for the security partnership"".""It is not clear why a military is needed in Solomon Islands, and there are not enough resources for the current police force,"" she told the ABC.""Security gaps could be filled by a better-resourced and supported police force. Law and order issues could be better addressed by investment in youth, development and economic opportunity.""And, finally, the greatest security threat — climate change — requires strengthened disaster preparedness and response.""Tess Newton Cain from the Griffith Asia Institute's Pacific Hub said both governments could face deep opposition in Solomon Islands and the wider Pacific region if they pushed ahead with the plan.""The question is whether the people of Solomon Islands think this is a good idea,"" Dr Newton Cain said.""There are huge human security and development challenges in Solomon Islands. I do not see how a military addresses the issue of a lack of adequate health care or education.""Numerous political and civil society voices from the region have raised their concerns about militarisation and how it is not wanted. Perhaps these voices are the ones Mr Marles should be paying attention to.""","Australia, China, Defence Forces, Defence Industry, Defence and National Security, Federal Government, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Unrest, Conflict and War, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2023-07-19 09:27:16+00:00

Ilaisa Drosese, Iosefo Masi, Caleb Muntz, Selestino Ravutaumada.Leone Nakarawa is set to miss out on a would-be record fourth Rugby World Cup appearance for Fiji.A regular in 2021, he dropped off the radar last year with younger talents preferred going forward, largely from Fijian Drua.Fiji's star backs all being available at once will mean Levani Botia can leave the 12 jersey to Josua Tuisova or Vilimoni Botitu and shift into openside flanker.Waisea Nayacalevu, Seta Tamanivalu, Semi Radradra and newcomer Iosefo Masi all deserve starting centre consideration so someone may spill out onto the wing.Vinaya Habosi and Seta Tuicuvu are established at left wing and fullback but Drua pair Selestino Ravutaumada and Ilaisa Droasese could force their way in.The reigning PNC champions have had the most consistency of the three, enjoying incremental growth under head coach Vaovasamanaia Seilala Mapusua.However, they have still added elite veteran talent in both positions of need — first five-eighths — and areas they enjoy greater depth — tighthead prop, blindside flanker — in their squad of 40 players announced on Sunday.Have played this World Cup cycle: Michael Ala’alatoa, Brian Alainu’uese, Michael Curry, Jack Lam, Seilala Lam, Jordan Lay, Fritz Lee, Genesis Mamea-Lemalu, Theodore McFarland, Alamanda Motuga, Ray Niuia, Taleni Seu, Samuel Slade, Sa Jordan Taufua, Luteru Tolai, Jeffrey Toomaga-Allen, Tietie Tuimauga, Chris Vui; Nigel Ah Wong, Ereatara Enari, Neria Fomai, Stacey Ili, Alai D'Angelo Leuila, Tumua Manu, Duncan Paia'aua, Ulupano Junior Seuteni, Jonathan Taumateine, Danny Toala.New and returning faces: Paul Alo-Emile (returning), So'otala Fa'aso'o, Miracle Fai'ilagi, Charlie Faumuina (former All Black), Titi Lamositele (former USA Eagle), Steven Luatua (former All Black, joined team for 2022 November tour) Sama Malolo, Christian Leali’ifano (former Wallaby), Melani Matavao (returning), Tim Nanai-Williams (returning), Lima Sopoaga (former All Black), Martini Talapusi.Captain Michael Ala'alatoa now has two former All Blacks challenging him for the 3 jersey with Charlie Faumuina's recruitment following Jeffery To'omaga-Allen's last year.The more important eligibility switch recruit is probably Titi Lamositele, who can fill a loosehead position in which nine players have been tried across Samoa's three tours.Celebrate the recruitment of Lima Sopoaga and Christian Leali'ifano, commiserate for Rodney Iona who is omitted despite playing heavy minutes on every tour and filling the 10 jersey admirably.Just two primary wing options; Nigel Ah Wong who has owned the left wing since debut, and Neria Foma'i who has filled gaps on either wing and at centre.Tumua Manu can push out from midfield but since fullbacks Danny Toala and Tim Nanai-Williams would struggle on the wing, there is room for more recruitment.Toutai Kefu's side has benefited most from the Regulation 8 amendments, going from scraping together a side including amateurs to face New Zealand in 2021 to being able to name a starting XV more than half-filled with former All Blacks and Wallabies.While there are genuine superstars in the squad of 35 named on June 14, they are still building chemistry together.Have played this World Cup cycle: Sosefo 'Apikotoa, Halaleva Fifita, Vaea Fifita, Siegfried Fisi'ihoi, Feao Fotuaika, Solomone Funaki, Tanginoa Halaifonua, Sione Havili Talitui, Tau Koloamatangi, David Lolohea, Samiuela Lousi, Sitiveni Mafi, Siua Maile, Samiuela Moli, Paula Ngauamo, Sosefo Sakalia, Ben Tameifuna, Lopeti Timani, Sione Vailanu; Malakai Fekitoa, Isileli Folau, William Havili, Solomone Kata, Fine Inisi, 'Otumaka Mausia, George Moala, Manu Paea, Salesi Piutau, Augustine Pulu, Sonatane Takulua, Afusipa Taumoepeau.New faces: Adam Coleman (former Wallaby), Pita Ahki (former All Blacks 7s), Patrick Pellegrini, Kyren Taumoefolau.The superstar backs like Isileli Folau and Salesi Piutau are bigger names but Adam Coleman settles a problem position where more than a dozen players have been tried since RWC19.The former Wallaby helps free Vaea Fifita and Tanginoa Halaifonua to concentrate on blindside flanker.William Havili is the easy first choice for number 10 even though he plays fullback for Moana Pasifika.There is little depth behind him after James Faiva's exclusion, as the versatile 'Otumaka Mausia and debutant Patrick Pellegrini both lack high-level experience.Like Coleman, Pita Ahki will solve the troubled second five-eighths position.Much like Fiji's backline riches, 'Ikale Tahi will struggle to fit him, George Moala, Malakai Fekitoa and Afusipa Taumopeau into the same matchday squad, especially given one of Folau and Piutau has to play wing. ","Fiji, Rugby Union World Cup, Samoa, Sport, Tonga, ",2023-06-23 20:00:00+00:00

Very high in comparison with current salary ranges here in Tonga at the moment,"" Tonga resident Mapa Taumalolo said.Mr Taumalolo, who has previously worked with the energy sector, said the rising cost of electricity was seeing families go without power.  ""There's been mass complaints from customers and [high electricity prices have] had a huge impact on the cost of living and inflation as a whole,"" he said.""As a result, there has been a reduction in daily energy consumption in everyday households.""According to UK-based aggregate website Cable, Tonga's electricity is the 13th most expensive in the world, at an average cost of US35 cents (52 cents) per kilowatt hour (kWh).The research, released in late 2021, analysed 230 countries and found Oceania was the most expensive region in the world, with an average of US30 cents per kWh. Tonga is heavily dependent on expensive, imported diesel fuels for power generation but has committed to a goal of generating 70 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025.While some families are turning to solar, Mr Taumalolo said it didn't necessarily mean cheaper prices.""We do not have the right configuration and the right set up for the exact renewable energy system,"" he said.""From my previous career, I was able to witness that having these solar panels run on the grid was actually more expensive than running off diesel … which was quite unexpected.""The Kingdom of Tonga has now come up with a bold new plan.In March, it signed a memorandum of understanding with an Irish-based wave energy company called Seabased to develop a 10-megawatt wave power park off the main island of Tongatapu.The technology, which will capture energy from waves and turn it into electricity, uses light construction vessels to deploy generators, known as wave energy converters. Each generator is held down by its gravity base foundation, which means it does not require drilling to stay in place. The kingdom's Minister of Internal Affairs, Albert Vaea, said it would help small island developing states which have ""some of the highest energy costs in the world"".""With the introduction of the deployment of renewable energy technologies ...  we have a chance to bring some meaningful and visible measure of relief to our people,"" he said.The project will be delivered in two phases — the first will begin later this year and will be a two-megawatt park, which will generate enough power for close to 3,000 homes.Once the entire 10-megawatt project is complete, it is expected to provide half of Tonga's energy and cut emissions by 20 per cent.Ray Wills is the managing director of business advisory firm Future Smart, and chairs a number of green technology companies.""There's a host of different ways to collect the energy, but the one in Tonga will be a point source absorber and it will sit in the water and move up and down as the wave passes over the top,"" he said.""Inside it is a generator that will spin and create electricity.""Mr Wills said there were few drawbacks to the technology.""They're fairly low disturbance. They sit under the water so they are protected from a rougher ocean,"" he said.""It has minimal impact on the environment and some would argue it can actually enhance the environment around it because it provides places for fish to live [and] things can grow on them.Mr Wills said the technology was far from perfect, largely because the ocean was ""a harsh environment for a piece of metal"".""You've got to be able to anchor it, protect it from storms and if you don't do those things then you've got to repair it which adds costs,"" he said.He said another big issue was making wave energy feasible.""The primary challenge is to make it more commercially viable and more economic,"" Mr Willis said.""We've got masses and masses of solar and wind projects now, which started really tiny and are now huge. Wave energy is, in comparison, very tiny so the challenge is to scale it up.""If we can make it work commercially, then it's a very reliable, cheap energy source.""Last year during a trial, Wave Swell Energy successfully generated energy from ocean waves to power homes — a first for Australia.However, after what it said was a lack of financial and political support in Australia, the company took its design overseas.Mr Wills said in addition to finding an ""ideal design"" that performed well and didn't break the budget, the project also needed to be big enough to retain a local workforce. ""If it's too small it might not be something that keeps workers in place. But if it needs manpower you'll be able to sustain a stable workforce,"" he said.""It's like any project. You've got to make sure you've got sufficient scale to make it worth doing the exercise.""Mr Taumalolo said he believed the renewables sector provided a great opportunity to keep people in Tonga.""We've been having lots of social problems with the labour mobility scheme [luring workers overseas],"" he said.""So having this opportunity here means more jobs and people will be interested in pursuing a career in these fields.""Tonga will be the first Pacific nation to experiment with wave technology, but it is still new, with little evidence the technology could provide power on a large scale.Nevertheless, Mr Wills said if it succeeded, it would set a precedent for other Pacific nations.""The advantage and disadvantage in Tonga is that energy is expensive so anything that reduces that energy cost, especially that eliminates oil and diesel, is an advantage.""You stop importing as much from overseas which impacts balance of trade, to making use of your own energy locally.""Tonga does rely on oil and diesel, so by eliminating that, you are reducing a costly fuel source to make use of a local one, so that's a win-win.""Tonga plans to have the entire wave technology project completed by 2025. ","Alternative Energy, Electricity Production and Distribution, Energy, Oceans and Reefs, Pacific, Solar Energy, Tonga, Utilities, ",2023-06-22 18:57:21+00:00

natural birth with as few interventions as possible.But what started out as a low-risk pregnancy suddenly became higher risk after she went into labour.Medical staff discovered she had pre-eclampsia — a serious condition characterised by high blood pressure — which ultimately limited her birthing options.""I wanted a water birth,"" Ms Maka said.""I came packed with my tea light candles, ready to create a safe environment, a calm environment.""As soon as they discovered that I had pre-eclampsia, it felt like control was taken away from me.""It wasn't up to me anymore — it was up to the medical professionals, and they were going to decide how to best manage my care and my birth.""It was out of my hands.""Women of migrant backgrounds, like Ms Maka, are more at risk of developing some pregnancy complications and are also more likely to have interventions during labour – such as the use of forceps, vacuums, episiotomies or caesareans – according to Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) figures.As part of the ABC's Birth Project, women from culturally diverse backgrounds shared their stories of complicated pregnancies and birth interventions, and their feelings about their experiences. Although Ms Maka had wanted to see the same midwife throughout her pregnancy, this was not an option and she saw different midwives at her public Melbourne hospital for her check-ups.A few weeks before she was due, she noticed some unusual swelling in her legs.She raised her concerns with a midwife, but since her blood pressure was normal, she was told not to worry about it.After a long labour and a series of interventions, including a step to speed up her labour that she felt pressured into, she gave birth to her baby girl.But her baby wasn't breathing.A medical team rushed into the room and was able to establish breathing.""It was the longest three minutes of my life,"" she said.""I felt like I couldn't do anything to help and I felt like it was my fault that my body physiologically could not do what it should have been able to do.""Ms Maka was left wondering what might have been different if she had continuity of care, and if there was any possibility the condition could have been detected earlier. Associate Professor at the Mercy Hospital Alexis Shub said pre-eclampsia can develop during pregnancy, during labour, or in rare cases, after delivery.In Australia, pre-eclampsia is estimated to occur in 5 to 10 per cent of pregnancies, and severe pre-eclampsia in 1 to 2 per cent.""The problem with pre-eclampsia is that it can have very serious risks for the woman, including the risk of having fits, and the risk of having a stroke, and the risk of kidney damage and the risk of significant bleeding,"" she said.""All of those things, if you haven't come in expecting them, can be very confronting, and very difficult to manage.""But I think also that all labour is unpredictable and that's one of the things that is hard to get your head around … you can't predict exactly what's going to happen.""Gestational diabetes is another complication that can arise in pregnancy — in some cases it can be managed with diet and exercise, but more severe cases might require medication and insulin to keep blood sugar in check.According to the AIHW figures, overseas-born women are almost twice as likely as Australian-born women to develop gestational diabetes in pregnancy — 21 per cent compared to 12 per cent.Among Australian-born women, these figures do not differentiate between non-migrants and those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.Some experts the ABC spoke to said the gap in data needs to be addressed.Dr Shub said with gestational diabetes, there was an increased risk for women of Asian and Indian descent, according to studies from Canada, the UK and Australia.""[There are] much, much higher rates of gestational diabetes in those groups as there's higher rates of type 2 diabetes in those communities,"" she said.Louise – who asked to use a pseudonym to protect her privacy – is of South-Asian origin, and as both her parents had type 2 diabetes, she was told she was at higher risk of developing the condition during pregnancy.An oral glucose tolerance test confirmed she had gestational diabetes.Louise previously had a miscarriage, which shaped her decision to seek out a private obstetrician for all her appointments.""When I became pregnant again, it made me nervous and quite anxious about it working out, so, I just really wanted that continuity of care,"" she said.Her obstetrician put her in touch with a dietitian, and she was able to manage her gestational diabetes through diet alone.In the lead-up to her due date, her obstetrician recommended an induction at 39 and a half weeks.""It was the gestational diabetes, me wanting to have a vaginal birth, and also there is a tendency for sub-continental women to have their placenta start to fail a bit sooner than Caucasian women or women of other ethnicities,"" Louise said.""I was OK with it because I felt really safe and comfortable with my obstetrician and how he took care of me for the whole pregnancy.""When it came to the birth, I trusted him.""But she still found it challenging to navigate birth advice – she had read books that talked about spontaneous labour as the goal, and she followed Instagram accounts that advocated non-medicated vaginal birth.""It made me second guess whether I should have an induction or not,"" she said.Dr Shub said women with gestational diabetes are more likely to have bigger babies, develop pre-eclampsia, or have interventions, and they are often advised to have their labour induced before they are full term.""We recommend that both because of the risks of the baby getting bigger, and because of the risks of stillbirth,"" she said.""And because of the bigger baby, the babies are more likely to need extra help with their breathing after they're born or with maintaining their blood sugars in a normal range.""But she said the recommendations for care could vary depending on the severity of the gestational diabetes and how it was being managed, or due to different hospital policies.Louise ultimately decided to go with her obstetrician's suggestion, but she went into spontaneous labour before her induction date.After some complications, she consented to an emergency C-section.Louise said while it was not the birth she had planned for, ""it was still a really beautiful experience"".""I felt really safe; even though it is called an emergency C-section, the whole process was calm and streamlined. I loved it.""Yvonne Peacock, a Pacific nurse and midwife in Western Sydney, said women with complications such as pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes were often left with fewer choices.""It definitely impacts on the care because it does become a lot more medicalised,"" she said.That was the case for Sydney-based Latvian-Australian Daina Kains, 37, who was diagnosed with gestational diabetes when she was around 30 weeks pregnant with her first child four years ago.""I was told that I was no longer able to do GP shared care and that I would have to have entirely all of my appointments with the hospital,"" Ms Kains said.""And the gestational diabetes put me in a higher risk category, so I couldn't do the midwife program – most of my appointments thereafter were with the doctors.""According to the Department of Health and Aged Care, birth centres and midwifery units are an option for women with normal or low-risk pregnancies, but aren't suitable for those with a higher risk of complications.Being in a higher-risk group meant Ms Kains didn't get the continuity of care she initially hoped for.""I felt like at every appointment, I was answering the same questions,"" Ms Kains said.""In theory, they've got all of the information in the file, but for busy doctors in a busy public hospital, they don't have time to read through all of that file before each new patient comes in.""You're repeating yourself. It's very tiring and it can be a bit stressful.""Ms Kains was induced before she reached full term, and she had an emergency caesarean.Dr Shub said antenatal care models can change depending on how severe their condition is and what care is offered in their hospital.""It can be upsetting for women to change their model of care,"" she said.""The reason that we diagnose and treat gestational diabetes is because it is associated with higher risks for the baby and for the woman.""Moving to a higher level of care is … to modify those risks.""In Melbourne, Ms Maka was left traumatised after giving birth.She was asked if she had any questions, but she didn't know where to begin.""No-one took the time to actually say, 'Hey, this is what went wrong. This is why it happened this way',"" she said.Louise had a debrief after her birth, and six weeks afterwards, and felt she had made the right decision.In Sydney, Ms Kains said she would have appreciated a proper debrief about her labour and what led to the emergency caesarean.But the obstetrician who delivered her baby did check on her the next day and reassured her that in the circumstances, ""It's a good thing we did this"".Dr Shub acknowledged it was an area for improvement, adding there were complexities about the best time, and how many times, to debrief.""That's really being recognised as an area that we haven't done as well as we should, and more effort is going into that,"" she said.Ms Peacock said the workload in busy birthing units meant medical staff often didn't have time.""There needs to be a follow-up system within hospitals, because I don't think there is enough,"" she said.Ms Maka felt a proper debrief would have helped her make better sense of what happened to her and her baby.""That would have 100 per cent helped,"" she said.

It's churned by strong winds. Waves and bubbles travel through the plasma, changing its density.When this happens, radio signals from navigation satellites passing through the plasma can get jumbled — or blocked altogether.Some waves and bubbles are produced by ""space weather"", such as geomagnetic storms, where massive clumps of plasma are flung from the Sun.Still others are produced by phenomena below the ionosphere, such as earthquakes, thunderstorms and volcanic eruptions.The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano eruption was no exception. It set off an ionosphere wave that circled the planet four times, affecting GPS in various parts of the world for days.It also produced a massive bubble that was detected above South-East Asia, and was carried by Earth's magnetic field to the north and south. Complicating matters somewhat was the arrival of a geomagnetic storm just before the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai eruption, said University of Newcastle space physicist Colin Waters. Professor Waters had worked with some members of the research team before, but was not involved in the new study.The geomagnetic storm was considered ""moderate"" in size, but there's a chance it helped trigger the bubble, Professor Waters said.Teasing out exactly how much the volcano contributed to the bubble's formation could take some time.""The generation of plasma bubbles depends on a whole lot of different things,"" Professor Waters said.""Here, you've got a moderate geomagnetic storm a couple of hours before the volcano eruption.""It's quite a complicated event.""Using data from ground-based GPS stations in Australia and the Pacific, Dr Carter and his colleagues could trace the bubble as it extended south, carried along Earth's magnetic field lines, where it hung out above Townsville for a few hours before dissipating.And it would have affected GPS users, but perhaps not the GPS most people are familiar with.Common GPS receivers, such as those in our smartphone, are accurate to tens of metres. More advanced devices are accurate to a few centimetres.This precise GPS can be accomplished in a couple of ways. One relies on a network of ground or reference stations, but the GPS device must be near a station to work.The other main method is called ""precise point positioning"", which doesn't need a reference station to calculate your precise position.""But [this method uses] a complicated algorithm and it does take a fair bit of time, maybe tens of minutes to an hour [to accurately lock onto its location],"" Dr Carter said.Throw a plasma bubble in the mix, and that ""fair bit of time"" can blow out considerably.And while precise point positioning is currently limited to, for instance, autonomous vehicles in mining and agriculture, it's set to become ubiquitous as self-driving cars take to the roads.""The new types of capabilities that will spawn from [precise point positioning] is where the future is,"" Dr Carter said. ""Not only will it tell you where you are, but it will tell you if your receiver is in your pocket or in your bag.""","Academic Research, Australia, Earth Sciences, Internet, Physics, Science and Technology, Tonga, Townsville, ",2023-05-24 19:00:00+00:00

He was the fastest man in the world in 2003 when he became the first person not of African descent to run under the magical 10-second mark.For 10 years he was an Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) scholarship athlete, but to this day nobody has sat down with the two-time Olympian to ask how he did it, operating within a system that was culturally unsafe, from where he learnt to pick and choose what was appropriate to draw the best out of himself.While recognising the opportunity of being surrounded by great coaches and support staff, he also knew there were some things he had to do his way, such as training without shoes and disagreeing when told he would never break ten seconds if he didn't go to train in the United States.Johnson shared his story in Brisbane this past week, home to the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, which won the bid to host the mega event partly on the promise it would be a Games for the region.The Oceania National Olympic Committee, with support from the Australian Olympic Committee, brought together key sports organisations and former athletes from the South Pacific to meet with Australian officials from government, sport and the university sector to discuss turning the regional games promise into a reality.Johnson's story resonated with the hundreds of Pasifika delegates, who often feel they are listened to without being heard.""Think about this,"" Johnson said. ""Twenty-four years old, I was at university and working for DFAT in Canberra, never dreamed of being an Olympian, I didn't know what track and field was. I didn't even know what running was.""Johnson lived on his father's boat in the Whitsunday Islands for the first 16 years of his life. No talent identification scouts ever got to those parts. If they did, they might have noticed his talents as a swimmer, rower or sailor, certainly not a runner.""So, I rocked up to the University Games and I won it. I had two weeks of training but no experience,"" Johnson said.""There's probably a lot of similarities I feel within Oceania, as well, around the talent that's hidden … growing up I never got the opportunity to dream it, see it, or believe in it.""The two-time Olympian is now a board member for the Brisbane 2032 organising committee where his greatest asset may be his skills in interpreting how the experiences of one group can be so misunderstood by the other.With all good intent, opening up Australia's high-performance system and making world class facilities available to the region is not a quick and easy solution many imagine.For starters, a return trip from Nauru, for example, to Brisbane costs $2,000. Then there are the difficulties of navigating a completely different cultural system, without the community-based support structures Pasifika athletes have grown up in.There are also lengthy delays and excessive red tape for athletes and support staff trying to obtain visas to come to Australia to train and compete. A special class of visa, dubbed a 'B2032' category, is one suggestion that emerged from the conference.New Zealand's two-time Olympic shotput champion, Dame Valerie Adams, who is of Tongan heritage was also a at the Step Up Oceania conference.She told The Ticket her hope is that regional benefits can come from the Brisbane games, but her concerns tell her otherwise.""It comes down to people running the show understanding Oceania,"" Dame Valerie said.""What I found — I shouldn't say disturbing, but I was a little bit uncomfortable — that quite a few of the presentations were very Australian based and not really taking into account the challenges that we have in Oceania.""Also, there was no olive branch given out while they were doing this presentation of 'this is how we can implement this in Oceania', or vice-versa.""""I believe it can be done … but we need the right people to understand our people, the culture, get the buy in, go in and see what is needed.""The collaborations are missing the point in my opinion … I feel like it's one talking with their stuff and then the other trying to meet or come up to this level, but it's never going to happen because the gap is too wide.""The landscape is littered with those who have eagerly accepted the chance of a tertiary scholarship to pursue their sporting dreams, only to return home before graduating – not because they weren't capable, but navigating a cultural space so different to your own can be an experience ranging from challenging to dangerous.Universities including Griffith and The University of Queensland (UQ) are actively involved in the Brisbane 2032 legacy discussions.UQ has also conducted research in the Pacific, partly funded by DFAT.""There's a few things that you should know about long—term athlete development models,"" Professor John Cairney, head of UQ's School of Human Movement and Nutrition Sciences, told the delegates.""Number one is that they are evidence-informed, not evidence-based. Which means no-one has ever tested any of these models to see if they actually work.""Research into high performance sport and talent identification programs are heavily skewed to men, predominantly from the West, with an over representation from the sport of football (soccer).""We can also question how much what we know in those countries is transferable to the Pacific,"" UQ Research Fellow Veronique Richard said.""Those studies that have actually evaluated the capacity to predict have come to the conclusion that it is very poor, our capacity to predict whether or not a young athlete will make it to the top is not so good.""Fiji's success in Rugby Sevens shows how a Pacific-based solution in high performance sport can be achieved. The men's team has won back-to-back Olympic gold medals, its women's team has won Commonwealth Games silver and Olympic bronze.But it's not without its own challenges.Kuini Vuli is an international referee and former player. She was one of ten recipients to receive ONOC-funded scholarships where at the University of the South Pacific (USP) she researched the experience of Fiji's female rugby players for her master's degree.""For a small Pacific Island nation, of 900,000 people, to get two gold medals [shows] we have found the formula,"" Vuli said.However, she said, to 'cut and paste' the men's program and expect it to succeed as a women's program was flawed.It failed to factor in the women's unique challenges of gender expectations, parental concerns, lack of facilities and equipment, and financial burdens.Former Tongan rugby player, Julio Paunga, is deputy vice chancellor of USP.He says the way sport is viewed in the Pacific has changed significantly, for men and women, and Brisbane 2032 provides an opportunity for much greater collaboration with Australian partners.He believes there will be Pacific success stories coming out of the Brisbane games but, he says, the legacy must extend beyond that.""For us … it's not only reaching the 2032 Olympics and it stops there … its also looking at the sustainability of that success so that we can move to a different level, especially in the islands,"" Dr Puanga said.""One thing that is very important when you become a policy maker, to make policy you really need to know who you are making and producing policy for … I think it is very important to consult.""Oceania nations know the risks that 'legacy 2032' will be a hollowed-out exercise in short-term political spin. They have seen it before.This time though there's a difference. A new contest off the sporting field that could shape what happens in it.While Australia talks about what it might do for the region, China has already come knocking.","Athletics, Australia, Brisbane, Fiji, Olympic Games Organising Committee, Rugby 7, Samoa, Sport, Sport Event, Sports Organisations, Summer Olympic Games, Tonga, ",2023-04-27 18:02:43+00:00

[and] are not intended to be binding on states.""The resolution, drafted by 18 countries, has asked the ICJ to rule on:What obligations do states, under international law, have to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases for States and for present and future generationsWhat legal consequences there are under these obligations for states where they, by their acts and omissions, have caused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment, with respect to:(a) States, including, in particular, small island developing states, which due to their geographical circumstances and level of development, are injured or specially affected by or are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change(b) Peoples and individuals of the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate changeProfessor Young said despite being non-binding, ICJ opinions were effective and could influence laws overseas.This was highlighted in an advisory opinion on the sovereignty of Western Sahara in 1975.""Australia didn't participate in that opinion, but subsequently, that opinion was cited by our High Court in the landmark Mabo decision of 1992 that found terra nullius to be a legal fiction in Australia, leading to massive changes to the law,"" Professor Young said.Advisory opinions on climate change could strengthen legal cases and clarify where countries are responsible for the carbon they emit, she said.""There is still uncertainty about the content of state obligations, despite the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.""Vanuatu, home to about 300,000 people across roughly 80 islands, has been labelled the most at-risk country in the world for natural disasters. In late February, Vanuatu was hit by two cyclones just days apart, shining a light on its vulnerability to climate change.But this push was an initiative by University of the South Pacific law students in 2019 who worked to get climate justice on the UN's agenda.Vanuatu's Climate Change Minister Ralph Regenvanu, who then began raising their plight to world leaders, said the country had always led on issues of climate justice.""We were a founding member of the association of small island states and the first chairman of that group, which is now one of the main climate lobbies at COP,"" he said.""We were the country to first raise loss and damage in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1981.""We've been a leader in many ways on climate change.""With Vanuatu's cyclone season ending in May, Mr Regenvanu said the biggest concern was being unable to keep people safe amid flooding, saltwater inundation and sea level rise. ""It's happening right now, and people are not safe right now,"" he said.He said relocating entire populations from flood-prone areas and building new infrastructure was a ""huge challenge"" for the cash-strapped developing nation.""We only graduated from least developed country status less than two years ago,"" he said.""We are a very poor developing country; we don't have the necessary money we need to build resilient infrastructure like new roads to withstand the impacts of climate change, which require 10 times the investment you need for a normal road.""That's why we've been fighting for this issue of loss and damage for a long time because we really desperately need the money, and it's a problem we didn't cause."" Mr Regenvanu hopes an advisory opinion will embolden Pacific people in their fight for climate justice.""The good thing about an ICJ advisory opinion is that no matter what court you're arguing — whether it be at the lowest level or the highest level — it applies,"" he said.""It can be used in any court as a persuasive precedent."" ","Climate Change, Climate Change - Disasters, Cook Islands, Fiji, Government and Politics, Intergovernmental Organisations, International Courts and Tribunals, Kiribati, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Niue, Pacific, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, ",2023-03-29 21:07:39+00:00

Once they arrive, there's a hit of dopamine seeing the familiar faces, pioneers together.At the Dolphins, the Mate Ma'a Tonga connections are lighting up the team.The Dolphins have more Samoan (seven) than Tongan (four) heritage players, but it is three Tongan representatives who are drawing attention — Kaufusi, Katoa and Niu. The Dolphins coach who knows them best isn't Wayne Bennet. It's Woolf, who will take over from 73-year-old Bennett as coach of the Dolphins in 2025.Woolf has led Tonga to victories over Australia, Great Britain, and New Zealand, making them the first tier-2 nation to defeat all three of international rugby league's superpowers.The boy from Mount Isa helped transform the tiny Pacific Island nation into a powerhouse, and he did so while working in assistant roles with the Cowboys and Broncos.He then took the helm at St Helens, leading the team to win the 2021 and 2022 Super League grand finals.Last week, Tesi Niu made history by scoring the first hat-trick for the Dolphins.It was a potent reminder of the 21-year-old's performance for Tonga at last year's World Cup when he scored three tries against the Cook Islands in Tonga's third-game victory over the Kukies.He signed with his new club in January of this year, with Woolf playing a key role, but Tonga teammates Katoa and Kaufusi both signed before Woolf.Kaufusi in particular played a key role in bringing Woolf to the club — the duo have a long history together, dating back almost a decade. Going against the usual coach-brings-in-player path, it was Kaufusi who helped influence Woolf's decision to join the Dolphins.""Felise and I had a number of discussions about what I was doing, and if the Dolphins were in consideration before I had signed,"" said Woolf.""When you know that there's good players involved, and good people involved — and Felise is both of those — it helps with your decision.""Woolf first coached Kaufusi in the lower grades at the North Queensland Cowboys before meeting again to represent Tonga.Under Woolf, Kaufusi played for Tonga from 2015 to 2017 and rejoined Tonga last year after representing Queensland and Australia. On Tuesday night it was Woolf, not Bennett, who supported Kaufusi in front of the NRL judiciary panel in Sydney.The Dolphins coach sat beside his visibly emotional player as Kaufusi was handed a four-week-suspension for a dangerous contact charge that will rule him out of Friday night's clash with Brisbane.Katoa had a breakout performance at last year's World Cup, which embedded confidence in the youngster's 2023 debut for the Dolphins and future in the NRL.The 18-year-old will again line up at five-eighth for Round 4's 'Battle of Brisbane', and has consistently delivered headline plays in the first three games.Already there are unforgettable moments like his match-winning pass against the Canberra Raiders in Round 2, but Woolf believes this is only the tip of the iceberg for Katoa.""There's a lot more influence he's going to have on the team,"" Woolf said.""It's up to us to bring that out of him but it's up to him to keep working hard to make sure he gets to those levels as well.""Katoa had already signed a three-year deal with the Dolphins at just 17 when he was first selected for Tonga's Pacific Test in June last year, but he missed out on the final squad.""We knew Isaiya was a very talented young man. We took him into the mid-season unsure if he'd play… and that was the way it ended up, he didn't play,"" said Woolf.Woolf continued to see something in Katoa, who was playing in junior rugby league for Penrith, and brought him back for the World Cup in England.""We picked him for the first game because he gave us the confidence that he had in himself. He did that in training to the point where we thought he needed to be in the team,"" said Woolf.""I thought he really grew at the World Cup. He had a bigger impact every game, and when you do that against PNG and Cook Islands,  and a knock out round against Samoa -- teams full of NRL players — that's a high standard of footy.""Everything I saw overseas said to me he was ready for the NRL.""Woolf will succeed Bennett as head coach of the Dolphins in 2025 — the same year as the next Rugby League World Cup.When Woolf first arrived back from the UK, it was the weekend of the iconic grand final between Samoa and Australia. It was a bittersweet moment for him.""There was couple of thousand Samoans celebrating here,"" Woolf said.""It was a bit of a kick in the guts.""On one hand, it gave Woolf no doubt about the strength of Redcliffe's Polynesian community, but on the other hand, he knew it could've been Tonga.Woolf hasn't lost the passion for Tonga, and might have another World Cup in him, but that will be a Tonga team with a difference: it will feature Dolphins connections creating magic. ","Mount Isa, NRL, Rugby League, Sport, Tonga, ",2023-03-23 03:02:49+00:00

39,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-11-21/sea-floor-map-reveals-huge-cavity-left-behind-by-tonga-volcano/101674708,"When the underwater volcano Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai erupted in January 2022, scientists knew something extraordinary had happened.An ash plume shot 57 kilometres into the atmosphere; shock waves rippled through the atmosphere, and the eruption triggered a tsunami that reached heights of more than 19 metres above sea level.But masked by the waters of the Pacific Ocean, what happened beneath the surface has largely remained a mystery.In an effort to better understand the sequence of catastrophic events that came both before and after the eruption, scientists have spent the past few months scanning the sea floor looking for clues.The team of oceanographers, biologists and geologists led by New Zealand's National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) – with the help of an uncrewed boat remotely controlled from Essex in the UK – joined forces to produce one of the clearest pictures to date of what took place underneath the water.This sea floor data shows what the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano looked like before the eruption.An enormous underwater volcano, almost two kilometres high and more than 20 kilometres across.At the top, a 150-metre deep depression known as a caldera.The new ocean floor map shows the area inside the volcano's rim has been replaced by an enormous 850-metre deep cavern in the centre of the volcano.Kevin Mackay, the project leader and a marine geologist from NIWA, described the size of the crater as ""mind-blowing"".While the depth of the caldera shocked him, the fact the rest of the volcano appeared to be largely unchanged was equally as surprising..""I can't think of any time where volcanic eruptions of that scale have left the volcano intact,"" Mackay said.By comparing this newly captured data with a sea floor model from 2017, scientists at NIWA were able to calculate just how much material the volcano erupted. The volume of material displaced in an eruption is a common measure of the size of a volcanic event.It's also a key metric in determining where an eruption sits on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) – similar to the Richter scale for earthquakes.They found the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai spewed out at least 9.5 cubic kilometres of material – a third more than the team's initial estimates.By comparison, the 1991 eruption at Mt Pinatubo in the Philippines discharged 5.5 cubic kilometres of material and 4 cubic kilometres was erupted over Naples from Mt Vesuvius in 79AD.""So we're talking a truly globally massive eruption,"" Mackay said.The findings show that two-thirds of the displaced material came from the caldera, what is now the huge hole left behind inside the volcano. The rest of the material came from the volcano's rim and flanks.The fact the exterior looks relatively unchanged despite losing such huge volumes of material shows just how big the volcano is.The sea floor survey mapped an area within a 20-kilometre radius of the volcano. In that area, they found 6.7 cubic kilometres of the displaced material and another recent study found 1.9 cubic kilometres of material ended up in the atmosphere.So where did the rest of the material go?To find out, scientists took core samples from the sea floor beyond the area that they had mapped. Incredibly, they found material from the eruption 80km from the volcano.Mackay said their findings showed the material had been transported that distance in what's known as pyroclastic density channels – a violent and fast-moving mixture of searing hot rocks and gases.When the roof of the caldera collapsed, it triggered what's known as a phreatomagmatic eruption, where hot magma comes into contact with relatively cooler water to create immense amounts of steam.The transfer of energy created an explosion akin to a shotgun blast that fired volcanic rock and ash into the sky. Weather satellites captured the blast, which was so powerful that it sent shock waves rippling through Earth's atmosphere.The data captured by Mackay reveals that as that rock and ash came crashing back to Earth, it formed these pyroclastic density channels.Basically, underwater avalanches that tore along the sea floor at speeds of up to 100kmh. On the land, these flows are the most deadly of all volcanic hazards.While the NIWA scientists found evidence the pyroclastic flows travelled 80km from the volcano, they believe they could have reached as far as 100km away.""[This] just supersized any observation ever made in science. And it's just really left scientists scratching heads going 'Wow. How did this happen?',"" Mackay said.These avalanches also help explain the destruction of Tonga's underwater communication cables, which were severed in the aftermath of the eruption cutting the Pacific island nation off from the rest of the world.The domestic communication cables linking Tonga's mainland to its outer islands run about 20km to the east of the volcano.It was decimated, according to Mackay, as this underwater avalanche ripped through the sea floor. The cable is now covered under 30 metres of volcanic material.This mass of molten rock and gas was so powerful that it forced its way up and over an enormous underwater ridge line and into a valley to the south of the volcano where it crushed Tonga's international communication cable. This line provided internet connectivity to the Pacific island nation.""The sheer force of the flows is astonishing,"" said Dr Emily Lane, principal scientist in NIWA's natural hazards division.To produce this sea floor map, the researchers used a device known as a multibeam echo sounder. It's like a fish finder, that you might find on an amateur fishing boat, but on steroids.Instead of pulsing just one soundwave, it fans out hundreds of pulses simultaneously in different directions to produce a 3D map of the sea floor.To get a complete picture of the sea bed, the vessel carrying the echo sounder captured the data in strips. Mackay likened it to mowing the lawn.""We go up a line mowing three-dimensionally, one strip of the sea floor and then turn around and then mow the adjacent strip,"" he said. ""Over time we build up this great three-dimensional image of the sea floor.""The sea floor mapping took about two months and covered about 22,000 square kilometres.Most of that area was mapped using NIWA's research vessel, but for the areas directly over the caldera where the conditions were more hazardous, they used what's known as an uncrewed surface vessel.This remote-controlled boat was able to travel to the most dangerous areas directly over the enormous cavity, allowing scientists to spot volcanic activity emanating from a newly formed cone near the western ridge of the caldera's rim.Kevin Mackay said while the risk of any further major eruption was extremely low in the near future, he believed the continued activity could lead to the birth of a new island as the cone continued to accumulate volcanic matter.Reporting, mapping: Mark DomanDesign: Alex PalmerDevelopment: Katia Shatoba, Thomas Brettell","Disasters and Accidents, Earth Sciences, Tonga, ",2022-11-21 00:01:03+00:00

It went from nothing to a 57-km high cloud in just 30 minutes. I can't imagine what that must've been like to see from the ground,"" Mr Proud said.""Something that fascinated me was the dome-like structure in the centre of the umbrella plume. I've never seen something like that before,"" added Oxford atmospheric scientist and study co-author Andrew Prata.The damage from the eruption obliterated a small and uninhabited nearby island and resulted in the deaths of six locals.Its plume extended through the bottom two layers of the atmosphere, the troposphere and stratosphere, and about 7km into the mesosphere. The top of the mesosphere is the coldest place in the atmosphere.The plume was far from reaching the next atmospheric layer, the thermosphere, which starts at about 85 km above Earth's surface.A delineation called the Karman line, about 100 km above Earth's surface, is generally considered the boundary with space.Scientists used three geostationary weather satellites that obtained images every 10 minutes to measure the blast and relied upon what is called the parallax effect: determining something's position by viewing it along multiple lines of sight.""For the parallax approach we use to work, you need multiple satellites in different locations — and it's only within the past decade or so that this has become possible on a global scale,"" Proud said.Until now, the highest recorded volcanic plumes were from the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, at 40 km, and the 1982 eruption of El Chichón in Mexico, at 31 km.Volcanic eruptions in the past likely produced higher plumes but occurred before scientists were able to make such measurements. Reuters","Tonga, Volcanic Eruptions, ",2022-11-06 22:55:45+00:00

Samoa will get their shot at redemption and what their star players were aiming to build when they defected from Australia has now come to pass. But let's bask in the glow of a Pacific clash for the ages just a bit longer.Let's cash in this ticket and spend the money. Let's make real, concrete plans for it to happen again in Sydney, or Auckland, or Brisbane or the bottom of the ocean or the peak of Mt Everest, because no matter where you play this game the people will find it.There is still part of the World Cup to go, but we can worry about that later.For now, just enjoy this one and all the things that happened, because what else is rugby league for if not days like this?","England, NRL, Rugby League, Samoa, Sport, Tonga, ",2022-11-06 21:09:03+00:00

From the west of Sydney and the south of Auckland, from Brisbane and Melbourne, from Apia and Nuku'alofa, from the islands of Hawai'i and the mountains of Utah, they are all coming.On Monday at 12:30am (AEST), Tonga will play Samoa for a shot at the World Cup semi-finals and in doing so reignite the most exhilarating rivalry in international rugby league. And so the fans will come from all the corners of the Earth as the Polynesian diaspora finds a new home for 80 minutes, and they'll sing like angels and howl like wolves and the flags will fly through the crisp English air as a rivalry that's been going on for thousands of years half a world away begins its next chapter.""People don't care where the game is, where they're playing, they're just proud – proud of the players who have been picked to play for their country, proud of all the big name players who came back to play for their families,"" former international John Asiata said.""You look back home right now, there's parades everywhere, it's gone wild. No matter where they are, they'll be tuning in.""There'll be some noise. I know a lot of people flew here for the games, Tonga had a big reception when they landed in London.""I'm not expecting anything different, the English love their footy and this is one they're not going to miss.""Asiata knows both sides of the Tonga-Samoa divide well. Along with Jorge Taufua, he's the only man to have pulled on both jerseys and understand what exists between the two communities.Sometimes, things have gotten out of hand. There is a history between these two nations that is older than rugby league, as old as the mists of time itself, and those things run deep.There was violence between rival fans in the lead-up to their meeting at the 2017 World Cup and when Asiata switched from Samoa to Tonga he copped plenty of grief.There's the potential for the rivalry to turn sour and sow hatred, but players from both sides have worked hard to make sure that isn't the case. As explosive as the action on the field might be, that's where the drama begins and ends.""When I switched over to Tonga I got a lot of hate for it. When it comes to rugby league, Tonga and Samoa clash but it's a little bit different these days,"" he said.""There are friendships between the boys, so many of them play together, and the history of the battles between the two can be tough.""It's brought people together. It doesn't matter where you're from or what you do, the battle is on the footy field but off the field Samoans and Tongans are starting to come together as a community.""It's not about we're better than you or you're better than us anymore, it's about the Pacific people being able to represent who they are and where they're from.""Nowhere is that spirit of competition and unity personified better than the pre-match cultural challenges.Roughly translated, Samoa's Sivi Tau proclaims that their strength is at its peak and the opponent must make way and stand aside, while Tonga declares they will stamp the ground with a thunderous noise.They're the kind of things that cannot really be described. They have to be seen and heard to be understood.Before they meet in Warrington, Tonga and Samoa will once again do their challenges together, as they have before their last two matches, in a show of unity even as the two sides try to end one another's World Cup campaigns.""That's the battle between both countries, that's their cry to war, that's what they do before something big, before they want to compete,"" Asiata said.""When they do it together it's a call for their country, that this is their battle and they're going to win this.""You see now a lot of Polynesians come together after the game and pray. The battle is on the field and after that it's peace and harmony.""It's saying that God is going to be with us when we go to this war, we're not alone and we have people around us who can help us.""There is nothing like it. It's nerve-wracking, but you're pumped. Sometimes when I'm on my knees doing it I get the shakes, but once you're doing it? It's the best thing ever.""For all their differences, the two nations are inextricably linked. Samoa has enjoyed a host of players switching allegiances from Australia and New Zealand to their country of heritage, due in no small part to a desire to replicate Tonga's experience from the 2017 World Cup.""We come from two little islands in the Pacific and we're close as countries. There's always been rivalries between Tonga and Samoa, for many years. And it'll be no different,"" Tongan five-eighth Tui Lolohea said.""[But] it's not just Tonga and Samoa, it's Fiji and Papua New Guinea, most of the Pacific teams are in the quarter-finals which shows you how big the Polynesians are in the NRL and Super League.""We're making steps forward and making big movements.""Picking a winner between the two is no simple task. Samoa was embarrassed in the tournament opener against England but has improved since, while Tonga has also steadily upped its game while remaining unbeaten. With both sides boasting the kind of forward packs that could scare a starving dog off a meat truck, it will fall to the playmakers to dictate the outcome.Samoa's Jarome Luai is coming off back-to-back man-of-the-match awards and is one of the classiest five-eighths in the NRL, but Tonga's Lolohea has a history of rising to the occasion when he's in the red jersey.Regardless of the result, it's hard to see any way this isn't one to remember. Both sides might be thousands of miles from their heartlands, but the stakes have never been higher.Pride and honour are always on the line, but with a World Cup semi-final at stake that means there's some glory to be had as well.So make way and move aside, because their strength is at its peak and they will stamp the ground with a thunderous noise because Tonga against Samoa is rugby league dynamite and it's about to explode.","NRL, Rugby League, Samoa, Sport, Tonga, United Kingdom, ",2022-11-05 00:09:04+00:00

And it loomed over their 62-4 win over France in Warrington.Junior Paulo and Brian To'o played their best matches for Samoa, and Anthony Milford wound back the clock at halfback with a number of classy touches.Joseph Suaalii had his most complete game as a fullback, looking far more comfortable as he threw the final pass for several tries.It wasn't just the big names who got it done either; Cronulla prop Royce Hunt ran the ball as if a Frenchman once wronged him in a deep and personal way and he'd spent years waiting for a chance at revenge, while winger Taylan May crossed for four tries.In all, plenty of the qualities that made Samoa pre-tournament darlings shone through. France were game in the first half but totally dropped the ball after the break. You get the feeling, however, that even on their best day, they couldn't much Samoa's muscle or their skill.That's precisely how it should be for nearly every team that Samoa face. The talent of this side is so blindingly obvious and the possibilities for the future are so tantalising it almost hurts. They should be able to look any team in the world in the eye without blinking.As impressive as Samoa looked, this victory, like last week's steadying win over Greece, taught us nothing we didn't already know. The only way Samoa can find the redemption they need is to produce this sort of football against another of the international heavyweights.They'll get the chance to exorcise those demons next week when they take on Tonga in the quarterfinals in a Pacific Islands showdown that's so packed with star power, passion and pride that it might reduce Warrington to a pile of smouldering rubble.Tonga are exactly where Samoa want to be. They've taken the scalps of New Zealand, Australia and Great Britain, and have become international rugby league's most vibrant and exciting team.Several of Samoa's stars have admitted they were inspired to take up the blue and white jersey because of what the Tongans have achieved and what they've built over the past few years.This meeting between the two sides — their first clash in four years — brings both countries' journeys full circle. Samoa haven't beaten Tonga since 2016, which was their last meeting before Jason Taumalolo led a cadre of stars back home and changed the game forever.Tonga will enter the game as favourites, but only just. They've been solid in their three matches without being outstanding and were lucky to escape their tournament opener against Papua New Guinea with a win.Picking the difference between the forward packs is nearly impossible, but the Penrith trio of Luai, To'o and Stephen Crichton give Samoa a clear edge in the back line.A Samoan victory would set up a likely semifinal berth with England and give Matt Parish's side a chance at revenge, which could swing their World Cup all the way back from stuttering disaster to dazzling announcement of a shining future.If the light comes through and eliminates the shadow of that first defeat, it will reveal all those things that were predicted for Samoa — all the glory and honour and pride players like To'o, Paulo, Suaalii and Josh Papali'i craved when they chose to tie their fates to their ancestral homeland — can still happen.But first, the demons must be exorcised and banished into the shadows. Nobody can forget what happened against England, and right now it's the headline of the World Cup, but it can still be relegated to a footnote.Samoa need to prove to the world and to themselves that what happened against England was a one-off, a freak occurrence, like losing a winning lottery ticket and being struck by lightning on the same afternoon.They have everything they need to make it so; all they need to do is go out and do it.","France, NRL, Rugby League, Samoa, Sport, Tonga, ",2022-10-30 23:42:59+00:00

Keaon Koloamatangi's 77th-minute score came after eight passes and a kick and saved Tonga's faces turning as red as their jerseys.Because it was not supposed to be this way. After all the hype and disappointment of Samoa's crushing loss to England last week, this was supposed to be a reminder of Tonga's quality and its true ambitions to give another World Cup a real shake.The wave of defections back in 2017 transformed Tonga into a Test football powerhouse overnight and since then the side has collected wins over New Zealand, Great Britain and Australia. With the players at their disposal, there should be no limit to what they can achieve.The talent isn't just on the field either. While Samoan coach Matt Parish is under fire, Tongan mentor Kristian Woolf's credentials are beyond reproach following three-straight premierships with St Helens.Even with captain Jason Taumalolo suspended, Tonga had a side so stacked there were three players with State of Origin experience on the bench.Only a fool would take Papua New Guinea lightly – the Kumuls players like to say their jersey is their second skin, and they play with a passion and intensity to make you believe it – but Tonga wasn't supposed to need a miracle try to win. This was meant to be a showcase of Tongan power.And it was that way, in parts, like when Tolu Koula knifed through the Kumuls defenders early on to set up a marvellous try for Will Penisini or when young phenom Isaiaya Katoa showed he's been studying footy as much as his HSC as he scored a try just before the break.On an uneven night for the Tonga, Koloamatangi was superb – after deputising at hooker early, he switched back to the forwards and set up a try for Moeaki Fotuaika before appearing from the clouds to score the winner.But as a team effort it was hardly the stuff tournament challengers are made of – the Kumuls made a game of it with their effort and energy and it was talent, not technique, that got Tonga home.Woolf's side will improve through the tournament as the players spend more time together and their next two matches – against Wales and an underrated Cook Islands side – will likely not be as testing. But even then Taumalolo's return can't come quickly enough.Papua New Guinea must be given enormous credit for nearly pulling off the ambush of the tournament so far. They have always played with a great physicality and have never known the meaning of fear, but now they have the craft and fitness to back it up.Their scramble defence and resilience to level up from an 18-6 half-time deficit were the highlights of what was perhaps their finest hour in a World Cup, even accounting for the loss and were it not for a bombed try by winger Daniel Russell we very well might have seen celebrations in Port Moresby that made Australia's America's Cup celebrations look positively tame by comparison.Stanley Tepend's side has become a quiet success story in international rugby league in recent years in very different fashion to Tonga.Where Tonga is built on the back of established NRL stars opting to represent their heritage, which is something Papua New Guinea benefits from as well through the likes of Lachlan Lam and Alex Johnston, the Kumuls also boast a series of homegrown stars who have risen from across their nation to become top class players.Chief among the examples is hooker Edwin Ipape, born and raised in Mt Hagen, who parlayed some strong Queensland Cup seasons into a full-time deal with Leigh Centurions in England's second division this season.Ipape won the competition's player of the year award and kept his good form going into this game, where he was man-of-the-match in a beaten side after a superb display at dummy half, highlighted by a blistering run to set up a try for Lam after half-time that spearheaded the PNG comeback.Since the PNG Hunters were introduced to the Queensland Cup in 2014 there have been similar stories across the national side as the Kumuls have risen from easy-beats to a firm place in Test football's middle class.From here, they can only rise further and the foundations are there to do it. There are more players like Ipape, or tough forwards Sylvester Namo and McKenzie Yei, all over Papua New Guinea, just waiting for a chance.Papua New Guinea's greatest days are still to come but Tonga's must happen right now. They are in the midst of a rich vein of talent but you never know when that might end or when one will come again.They were lucky to escape with this one and the result all but ensures a draw that should make them favourites to be the fourth team into the semi-finals alongside Australia, New Zealand and England. If they make it that far, anything can happen.But they cannot afford any further missteps because they have the chance to be truly great, to rattle the foundations of rugby league forever and who knows when they'll have a chance like this again?They should be one of the best teams in the world and need to start looking like it. This can be Tonga's golden time but only they can make it so.","NRL, Papua New Guinea, Rugby League, Samoa, Sport, Tonga, ",2022-10-18 22:20:56+00:00

But I would not be surprised if that is the case,"" Dr Kabutaulaka said.Tess Newton Cain, project lead at the Griffith Asia Institute's Pacific Hub, said it would be naive to believe the US was not influencing Guam's PIF push.""From the US point of view, given their avowed intention to be much more engaged in the region, they would see it as very beneficial,"" she said.""You're able to sit at that top table, if you like.""Guam's desire to join the PIF is likely to cause a stir among Pacific nations.Established in 1971 with the goal of enhancing regional cooperation, the forum was originally comprised only of independent Pacific nations.""I think it's important to remember that decolonisation in the Pacific was a founding principle for the establishment of the Pacific Islands Forum,"" Dr Newton Cain said.""There would be a question to be asked about whether allowing Guam to become a full member is in full alignment with that.""But Dr Newton Cain also pointed to a precedent set when the French territories of New Caledonia and French Polynesia were granted PIF membership in 2016.The decision was made partly on the basis that both territories had made significant steps towards gaining independence and were registered on the United Nations decolonisation list at the time.While Guam's Indigenous Chamorro people have campaigned for independence from the United States, the movement is not as formalised.""I'm not aware of any kind of pathway that's in place,"" Dr Newton Cain said.Mr Tenorio said it would be inconceivable to deny Guam's inclusion.""What would the difference be?"" he asked.""Guam has one non-voting delegate to the United States House of Representatives. So we even have less direct involvement in the national affairs of the United States.""He said Guam had received a ""tremendous amount of support"" from Pacific leaders when discussing its desire to join the forum.Federated States of Micronesia President David Panuelo said Guam's potential membership of PIF was a conversation well worth having.""Although often seen by outsiders as purely a territory or component unit of the United States, Guam – in a manner not dissimilar to New Caledonia and French Polynesia, or Niue and Cook Islands – is a self-governing Pacific Island,"" he told ABC.Mr Panuelo noted that Guam was already a member of other Pacific agencies, including the Pacific Island Development Program and the Pacific Community.""The Federated States of Micronesia understands and respects Guam's position and interest to join the Pacific Islands Forum,"" he said.Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs said it was aware of Guam's interest in joining the forum.New Zealand's Foreign Ministry said any decisions on membership of the PIF would need to be made by forum leaders on the basis of consensus.Other Pacific nations, including Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea have not responded to the ABC's requests for comment.Guam's bid to join the PIF comes at a tumultuous time for the regional body.Earlier this year, Kiribati announced its decision to leave the body after a year-long leadership dispute involving Micronesian countries.Dr Kabutaulaka said the dispute over Guam's inclusion could further destabilise the PIF.""Pacific Island countries might say 'our premier political organisation … is now being taken over by powers, such as the US, France, and therefore it is no longer worth being a member',"" Dr Kabutaulaka said.""I think with the current geopolitical discussions and competition that's taking place, some Pacific Island countries will push back on this.""He said there was potential for other US territories in the Pacific, including American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands, to follow Guam's lead and also apply for PIF membership.Dr Newton Cain pointed to potential governance issues.As an unincorporated US territory, Guam does not have the ability to exercise its own foreign policy and may not be able to sign treaties and agreements central to the PIF.""The more we have these members that … don't necessarily have the requisite amount of power to fully participate, then it can make things very complicated."" Dr Newton Cain said.She said the possible storage of nuclear weapons on Guam would be at odds with anti-nuclear proliferation pacts signed by PIF members.""Whether there are or are not nuclear weapons on Guam is not something that gets talked about in public,"" she said.""But I think there would certainly be some concern that having Guam as a member could cause problems on that score.""Issues may also arise from a pending review of the PIF's regional architecture.Solomon Islands cited the review when announcing an intention to hold off on signing a joint declaration with the US last month, although it did eventually endorse the pact.Soli Middleby, a former Australian diplomat to the Pacific, said Pacific leaders may want to complete the review before considering Guam's request to join the forum.""A lot of these questions around membership, how you engage, what the right set up for the Pacific Islands Forum should be fleshed out and discussed within that process,"" she said.""I think these things are always contentious.

It wasn't sugar-coating,"" he said. ""We had full-on, face-to-face meetings with a very focused view on what the US needs to do to re-engage with the Pacific.""He also noted that the statement was backed up by a ""significant package"" of resourcing and funds.Prior to unveiling the declaration, US President Joe Biden's administration announced it was ploughing more than $US810 million ($1.25 billion) into a slew of new programs across the region.  ""Full credit to the US. They recognised that their absence over decades resulted in a vacuum in the Pacific that has been filled by countries like China and others that have assisted,"" Mr Brown said. Mr Sogavare is in Australia today and will meet with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.""Our relationship with Solomon Islands is incredibly important,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement.Australia has been Solomon Islands' largest development partner in several areas, including education, health and infrastructure.However, an offer by Canberra last month to fund its next election led Solomon Islands to accuse Australia of ""interference"".Australia and the US have expressed growing concerns about China's influence in the region after Solomon Islands signed a controversial security pact with Beijing earlier in the year.Ahead of Mr Sogavare's visit, Solomon Islands Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele broke the country's silence on the US partnership backflip, saying the government endorsed the deal after references to China were removed. ""In the initial draft, there [were] some references that we were not comfortable with … but we were able to find common ground,"" he told journalists in New Zealand on Tuesday.""There were some references that put us in a position that we will have to choose sides, and we don't want to be placed in a position that we have to choose sides.""Mr Manele said Solomon Islands welcomed ""the US re-engagement with the Pacific"" but he also reiterated the nation's support for China.""Our security framework cooperation with China — and I think I have made this clear on a number of occasions — is basically based on a national security strategy that is domestically focused,"" Mr Manele said. ""Of course, we are guided by the existing regional security arrangements that we have in place … I can assure you, as I've assured others, that there is no provision for a military base in that agreement.""He added that Solomon Islands looks forward to ""working with all our partners"".""My belief and my hope is this: that the Indo-Pacific should be a region of peace, of cooperation and of collaboration,"" he said.""It should not be seen as a region of confrontation, of conflict and of war,"" Mr Manele said.While the US negotiations would have played a main role in getting Mr Sogavare on board, Solomon Islands opposition MP Peter Kenilorea Junior believes other leaders would have also been in the prime minister's ear.""I wouldn't be surprised if there were some words between Solomon Islands and perhaps some of the bigger Melanesian countries like Fiji and Papua New Guinea,"" he said.""Just reminding the Solomons, 'Hey, what's really happening? Why you doing this?' And 'let's work this out.'""Tarcisius Kabutaulaka — an associate professor at the Center for Pacific Islands Studies at the University of Hawaii — said he believed the Pacific nations had been in discussions with the US long before last week's leaders' summit in Washington. ""Some of these negotiations and discussions have probably been going on for a while behind the scenes, with officials talking about it,"" he said. ""That's different to China, who came to the talks trying to push its development and security pact with Pacific Island countries without that background work.""I would assume that some of that had been taking place not only when the leaders were in New York for the UN General Assembly, but perhaps even before that.""Dr Kabutaulaka said the agreement signalled Washington's return to working broadly with Pacific nations, but he was not sure it was ""a success in the competition with China"".""What I am certain about is that it is a success in terms of the US projecting itself and its multilateral relationship with the Pacific Islands,"" he said.""Pacific island countries and governments were successful in including in the declaration things that weren't in earlier versions, like the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.""Dr Kabutaulaka said the new US declaration was unlikely to deter China, but Beijing would have to revise its pitch because ""its diplomacy sometimes backfires"".""I think China is going to come back,"" he said.""A lot of China's past engagements have been bilateral and, recently, we've seen China ramping up its multilateral engagements through the Pacific Island foreign ministers' meeting and the Pacific Islands Forum.""China is learning very quickly how to deal with Pacific Island countries, multilaterally.""While the final version of last week's US-Pacific declaration was ambitious, Dr Kabutaulaka said it remained ""promised money"".""It's not as though there's money waiting to be used for these things. This has to go through processes in Washington, so we'll have to wait and see whether that money will become actually available for Pacific,"" he said.""It's good to see that it's put out there. And let's hope that the US will be able to deliver on its promises.""Whether or not the US followed through depended on the outcome of the US House and Senate midterm elections in November, Dr Kabutaulaka added. ""I am concerned that, if we have a Republican majority in Congress and if the Republicans were to take over [the] presidency in 2024, whether they will be able to or willing to commit the same political will,"" he said.","Australia, China, Climate Change, Cook Islands, Foreign Affairs, Kiribati, National Security, New Zealand, Pacific, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Treaties and Alliances, United States, World Politics, ",2022-10-05 18:38:26+00:00
51,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-03/penrith-panthers-win-all-four-grades-nrl-grand-final/101495282,"After winning back-to-back premierships, reaching three straight grand finals, and topping the ladder two of the past three years, it could be easy to say it's job done for the Penrith Panthers.There's a reason no team won two in a row for the first two decades of the NRL era. And there's a reason that the two teams that have done it in the past five years — the Roosters and Panthers — are two of the best organisations in the league.But Penrith's dominance — losing just one regular season game before being stunned by the well-drilled, experienced Melbourne Storm in the 2020 grand final, then turning that heartache into steely resolve to win the 2021 and 2022 titles — has been as impressive as anything we've seen on a rugby league field this century.At full strength, they're basically untouchable, even for the best teams in the competition.Just looking at their six home-and-away losses in their premiership seasons, only Parramatta's two wins earlier this year were against something resembling a full-strength line-up. The rest came from unrecognisable Panthers teams, depleted by either State of Origin duty or resting stars late in the season.When Melbourne beat them 16-0 in round 20 this year, pundits hailed not only a return to form for one of the few teams to have beaten the Panthers since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but also used it as proof gods can bleed.Never mind the absence of Nathan Cleary, Jarome Luai, James Fisher-Harris, Dylan Edwards and Taylan May, like fighting Muhammad Ali in his prime or meeting Michael Jordan in the finals, teams were getting praised for even getting close. Anything to make believe the quest for the premiership is anything other than a one-horse race.But of course, as we know now and most of us knew then, it wasn't.Penrith got their superstars back in time for the finals, even if May got whacked by the karma police after the NRL's widely criticised rule-bending to allow him to play, and powered past the Eels and Rabbitohs (two teams who had beaten them in the past two years) to get back to the mountaintop as convincingly as possible.What people may have missed if they only clocked on for the 80 minutes between kick-off and the final siren in the men's decider is that Penrith's success runs much deeper than the 17 that took down the Eels on Sunday night.The under-18 SG Ball Cup, under-20 Jersey Flegg Cup and second-grade NSW Cup are all also safely in Penrith's hands, plus interstate supremacy, with the NSW Cup team hammering Queensland champs Norths Devils 44-10 in the State Championship on Sunday.So while it may seem fast, it makes perfect sense with this rarely seen level of success that Penrith is already being talked about as one of the greatest teams in the modern era.The one thing other great NRL sides like the Broncos, Roosters and Storm currently have over them is longevity, and the Panthers appear well placed to put together similar eight or 10-year runs to match those dynastic sides.Tigers-bound hooker Api Koroisau was diplomatic when asked after the grand final if this Panthers outfit was the best side of the past 20 years, saying he would leave it up to others to make those comparisons.""Leading up to his game it was business as usual and we acknowledged what people might say if we won or lost, but at the end of the day you're going out there and playing footy like you do every week. You work your arse off and you do what you get paid to do,"" he said.""They can say what they say, but the important thing is the feeling in this team right now. This is why we play this game.""The State Championship game gave us perhaps the best glimpse into the Panthers' immediate NRL future, with Soni Luke scoring one try, laying on three more, running for 80 metres out of dummy half and just generally running the show.Fans will get a good look at him with Tonga at the World Cup before he's expected to settle in as Koroisau's replacement at the Panthers in 2023.However Ivan Cleary decides to handle that — giving him the number nine to start, easing him in off the bench or some combination of the two — you would be a fool to bet against the Penrith coaching staff mishandling the 26-year-old's arrival in first grade.Also expect to see more of exciting outside back Sunia Turuva, who has shone in outings for Fiji and shown glimpses in three top-flight Penrith games this year.He scored three tries and ran for 500 metres across the NSW Cup grand final and the State Championship. All from the wing, which may not even be his best position.Most of the NRL champions interviewed after the grand final mentioned winning all four grades, the strength of the club's culture, repping the West, or all three. Those connections run as deep as the success this organisation is having.Centre Stephen Crichton said the younger players join the first-grade squad twice a week, strengthening that bond between the current stars and the back-ups and juniors gunning for their spots.And the NRL players were as pleased as anyone when it became clear everyone was going to have a grand final day.""[The strong culture is] not made up, it's not manufactured, the coaches didn't have to do too much to get it going,"" Koroisau said.""We have all these guys from different backgrounds and they just get together so well.""And while there are players from all sorts of cultural backgrounds, one club is particularly well represented.Both Luke and Turuva are Pacific Islanders from St Marys, so you can bet they'll have an extra strong connection with guys like Jarome Luai, Brian To'o, Moses Leota, Izack Tago and Christian Crichton.Those ready-made and intentionally fostered connections will be vital in coming years because Penrith's success is also coming back to bite them in typical salary cap manner.Key cogs like back-rower Viliame Kikau and veteran Koroisau are heading for more lucrative but likely less victorious pastures in Canterbury and Concord respectively.Young Tongan star Isaiya Katoa and handy recruit Sean O'Sullivan have been snapped up by the league's 17th team in Redcliffe, and they'll watch former development player J'maine Hopgood ply his trade for this year's runners-up.Penrith higher-ups have complained that the club is getting punished for its success, losing players they have turned into stars, but you could just as easily say, like missing mid-season games for State of Origin duty, this is just rewards for those stars playing key roles in championship runs.This team is also less littered with in-demand stars than some previous dynastic sides, which should make their success slightly easier to maintain, even as rivals pay overs to get a taste of that Penrith magic.Nathan Cleary is somehow still only 24 and the best half in the game, so they've locked him up on a fat contract through 2027. His co-captain, Isaah Yeo, halves partner Jarome Luai and Clive Churchill medallist fullback Dylan Edwards are all signed for two more seasons. And star prop James Fisher-Harris is signed through 2026.That's a lot of talent to have locked in before their prices really skyrocket on the back of more Penrith success.None of those players will be older than 30 by the time those contracts expire, and with NRL careers lasting longer than ever, that's not even that old nowadays.Add to that the wealth of talent that is clearly waiting in the wings, and we'd best get used to the Chocolate Soldiers marching from Mt Druitt to Homebush for a few more Septembers yet.","Australia, NRL, Pacific, Rugby League, Sport, Tonga, ",2022-10-03 02:06:13+00:00

declaration, vowing to strengthen ties amid growing concerns of China's role in the region.The US managed to secure support from all 14 Pacific island states attending a two-day summit in Washington DC, despite an initial refusal from Solomon Islands.""Pacific leaders welcome the United States's commitment to enhance its engagement, including by expanding its diplomatic presence, the ties between our peoples, and US development cooperation across the region,"" the declaration, released by the White House, said.The 11-point, Declaration on US-Pacific Partnership, was intensely negotiated.It had initially been described by some Pacific nations as ""similar"" to the trade and security deal China unsuccessfully pursued with 10 nations in May.The declaration provides a framework for intensified US engagement in the Pacific, including commitments to tackling climate change, advancing economic growth, and bolstering Pacific regionalism.The statement also acknowledged the importance of international law and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on freedom of navigation and overflight.Solomon Islands last month put a moratorium on foreign navies making port calls, raising concerns in this area among the United States and its allies.Since signing a deeply controversial security pact with Beijing earlier this year, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has repeatedly berated traditional partners including Australia and New Zealand, while drawing closer to China.The country signalled it would not sign the declaration during the summit, saying it needed more time to reflect on the proposal and that it would have considered by its national parliament.However, Mr Sogavare has now endorsed the declaration and was even photographed posing shoulder-to-shoulder with the US President. Earlier, President Joe Biden's administration also announced a slew of new programs to substantially broaden the United States' presence in the Pacific.The US has promised to expand police training, sign new defence pacts, boost investment in the region, ramp up development initiatives and plough more than $75 million into helping Pacific economies recover from the COVID pandemic.The US will also move to extend full diplomatic recognition to New Zealand's two associated states in the Pacific — Cook Islands and Niue — in another sign it wants to expand its influence in the South Pacific.The strategy promises to ""elevate broader and deeper engagement with the Pacific Islands as a priority of US foreign policy"" to help the region fight climate change and other pressing challenges.It also explicitly links the US strategy to China's growing presence in the region, warning that ""pressure and economic coercion by the People's Republic of China"" risks ""undermining the peace, prosperity, and security of the region, and by extension, of the United States"".The White House said the announcements amount to more than $US810 million ($1.25 billion) in expanded programs – although that figure includes $US600 million for fisheries assistance over a decade already pledged by Vice-President Kamala Harris at the Pacific Islands Forum earlier this year.The new US announcements cover a wide array of different programs and initiatives, both new and existing, although the funding packages offered are sometimes modest.The US has confirmed it will expand the footprint of USAID in the region, opening a regional mission in Fiji's capital within 12 months and opening a new office in Papua New Guinea.It has also chosen former Ambassador to Fiji Frankie Reed as its first-ever US Envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum.There's also a strong focus on security cooperation.The administration said it will provide extra funding to enhance US Coast Guard training in the Pacific, as well sending Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents to Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands to provide law-enforcement training.Australia has long been Solomon Islands' main security partner, but China has recently made significant gains in the country, signing a contentious pact and beginning a police training program for local forces.The US also said it was pursuing a defence logistics and supply agreement with Fiji, and will soon begin negotiating a defence cooperation agreement with Papua New Guinea.Anna Powles from Massey University said some of the new announcements showed how security cooperation was a ""key pillar"" of US engagement in the Pacific.""This is reflected in the reference to an increased defence presence in the Pacific, negotiating a defence cooperation agreement with PNG, and the new [defence pact] with Fiji as well as law-enforcement training by the FBI,"" she said.""The US strategy calls out China as a source of geopolitical pressure and economic coercion felt by PIF member states and makes a direct link between Chinese actions undermining peace and security in the region and the US's own security.""Good intentions aside, this is the call to arms that is driving US engagement.""The United States has also announced a raft of climate, education, investment and infrastructure initiatives.It will establish a new fellowship program for emerging Pacific leaders, send Peace Corp volunteers to Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Tonga after a long absence, and develop a new agreement to encourage US private sector in key Pacific Island infrastructure projects.In addition, it will plough another $US18 million into a major program to expand electrification through Papua New Guinea.The Biden Administration has also promised more than $US130 million to help Pacific nations tackle climate challenges and leverage financing to help build resilience, predicting it could draw in $US400 million in private capital.Tess Newton Cain from the Griffith Asia Institute's Pacific Hub said the initiatives demonstrated the strength of US intent in the region, but warned that the program could quickly falter if it didn't draw on local expertise and priorities.""The Americans want to move with breakneck speed but the elephant in the room is the question of coordination and coherence across agencies,"" she said.""There are a few references to this being demand led, but the overall tone is one of this being supply led. There's not enough understanding of what's already happening, and especially what is being developed through local leadership.""Dr Powles said the Biden Administration was intent on locking in its Pacific strategy and tackling its key priorities in the region ahead of approaching US House and Senate elections.""There's clearly a desire to move fast and bed down commitments quickly. The tempo may slow down in the lead up to November midterm elections and afterwards,"" she said.""But it is less clear how the US system will deliver the strategy; including building the infrastructure to do this, and that's where it could fall down.""If you aren't building Pacific knowledge and expertise then you'll hit problems. It's that coordination piece which is missing in Washington.""","China, Climate Change, Foreign Affairs, Kiribati, National Security, New Zealand, Pacific, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Treaties and Alliances, United States, World Politics, ",2022-09-29 19:20:54+00:00

countries condemns Russia's invasion of Ukraine, flags intensifying American security cooperation with the region and declares climate change is the ""highest priority"" and ""single greatest existential threat"" to the Pacific.However, Pacific nations appear to have stripped away a section which seems to take aim at the contentious security agreement signed by China and Solomon Islands, deleting a reference to the need for Pacific Island states to ""consult with one another closely on security decisions with regional impacts"".Leaders from 12 Pacific Island countries are set to join US President Joe Biden and a string of top US officials at a high-profile summit in Washington DC over the next two days.It's the first time such a large group of Pacific Island leaders have been hosted at the White House, and the US is flagging it will make ""substantial"" new announcements ramping up its regional diplomatic, commercial and development initiatives.The Biden administration has also flagged it will launch its new Pacific strategy in the coming days to ensure all US government agencies are working together effectively in the region.The joint statement being negotiated by the US and the Pacific for the summit spans a wide range of topics, including climate change, security, illegal fishing, the legacy of nuclear testing and the economic recovery from COVID-19.Solomon Islands has already flagged it will not join the declaration this week, saying it needs more time to consider the document.Multiple Pacific Island government sources also stressed negotiations were still ongoing, and the document was likely to change further ahead of the summit.Some Pacific leaders have compared the US declaration to China’s proposal for a sweeping, detailed trade and security deal with the Pacific, which leaders rejected earlier this year.The draft version seen by the ABC largely focuses on laying out the principles and broader framework for intensified US engagement in the Pacific.The declaration opens by saying the US and Pacific Island countries ""recommit to working together in genuine partnership"" to tackle ""mounting challenges"" including a ""worsening climate crisis and an increasing complex geopolitical environment.""The draft also says Pacific leaders welcome the US commitment to ""expand its diplomatic presence and development cooperation"" in the region.On climate change, the declaration urges all countries and major emitters to ramp up ambition to ensure their planned cuts to emissions align with the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.It reiterates that climate change is the ""single greatest existential threat to the livelihoods, security … and wellbeing"" of the Pacific and urges developed countries to ramp up climate finance to meet the 100 billion target to help developing countries deal with the impact of climate change.The section on security has already been edited several times, with one source telling the ABC the negotiations over wording had been long and protracted because the subject was so sensitive.The draft seen by the ABC condemns ""Russia's brutal war against Ukraine"" and calls for Moscow to withdraw, although that section is still being negotiated, with Solomon Islands pushing for weaker language to be used.There's also a reference to maintaining peace in stability ""in the Indo-Pacific, including across the Taiwan Strait"" – although some close observers predict that reference may be deleted in the final version.The draft commits to deepening US economic engagement in the Pacific, saying Washington will support ""infrastructure, transportation, connectivity, cyber security capacities and digital infrastructure.""It also commits to intensifying efforts to improve maritime security, curb plastic pollution and fight illegal fishing.Earlier this year Vice-President Kamala Harris announced the US would boost economic assistance to the Forum Fisheries Agency, as well as opening new embassies in Tonga and Kiribati while relaunching the Peace Corps in the Pacific.A senior administration official told journalists that the White House summit was ""unprecedented"" and signalled the US government's determination to lift its game in the Pacific.""The president and secretary of state will be basically unveiling … substantial new initiatives, new funding that will affect every element of government purpose from our compact negotiations to the Peace Corps to USAID,"" they said.The senior official said the Pacific's ""demand signal"" for greater US involvement in the region was ""louder and clearer than it ever has been"".""The United States is a responsible country and understands that the need for deeper, more sustained American engagement.""The senior official also declined to comment directly on the decision by Solomon Islands not to join the declaration, saying simply that the US was ""patient and fully committed to working in close consultation with Pacific Island nations on the issues that we both think are critical going forward.""Dr Anna Powles from Massey University told the ABC the draft declaration ""reveals Washington's desire to move fast and decisively in the Pacific"" but said the US ""needs to be careful not to leave the region behind.""""The draft declaration is revealing in what it tells us about the constraints and limits of US engagement and action as well as the clear position that Pacific countries are taking with respect to Forum centrality and their 'red lines' when it comes to climate change and the sovereignty and national interest of member states,"" she said.","China, Foreign Affairs, Kiribati, New Zealand, Pacific, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Treaties and Alliances, United States, World Politics,

the United States and Pacific Island nations this week, dealing a blow to the White House ahead of a high-profile presidential summit with Pacific leaders in Washington.The ABC has been told that Washington and Pacific Island countries have spent recent weeks negotiating a new joint statement on the partnership between the US and the Pacific states.The declaration is designed to provide a framework for intensified US engagement in the Pacific.Washington is moving to ramp up its diplomatic, development and commercial presence in the region, partly in response to China's growing influence in several Pacific nations.Some Pacific leaders have described the declaration as being ""similar"" in intent to a more sweeping trade and security deal which China unsuccessfully pursued with 10 Pacific Island nations in May.Washington's proposal covers issues including strengthening US-Pacific ties, tackling climate change, sustainable development, security and preserving the rules-based international order.Several Pacific nations are expecting to sign the declaration during the historic meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House on September 28 and 29.It's the first time Pacific nations have been invited to Washington for an in-person summit.However, several sources stressed that negotiations over the joint declaration are still ongoing.The ABC has also been told that Solomon Islands sent a diplomatic note to other Pacific Island nations on Monday, announcing it will not sign up to the declaration this week, and stressing there was no consensus over the document.The note also said Solomon Islands needed more time to reflect on the proposal, and that the declaration would have to be considered by its national parliament.The move is likely to consolidate anxieties in both Canberra and Washington about the trajectory of Solomon Islands under Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, who has repeatedly berated traditional partners including Australia and New Zealand, while drawing closer to China.Earlier this year Solomon Islands also signed a deeply controversial security pact with Beijing, although Mr Sogavare has repeatedly ruled out allowing China to establish a military presence in the country.It's not clear what impact Solomon Islands' decision to hold off on the declaration will have on negotiations over the text.Several other Pacific nations have welcomed increasing US engagement in the region, while also making it clear that it must be on their terms.Federated States of Micronesia President David Panuelo said there had been a ""very involved process"" to develop the document, which was initiated by the White House.""Our officials have been going back and forth with the United States,"" Mr Panuelo said.He said it focused on bolstering Pacific regionalism, tackling climate change, advancing economic growth, and supporting disaster preparation and response.It also includes addressing COVID-19 and other health concerns, responding to the legacies of war in the Pacific and promoting nuclear non-proliferation.Washington has been increasingly uneasy about the way China has expanded commercial and security links in the Pacific, suggesting it could undermine sovereignty across the region.Earlier this year, China sought a multilateral trade and security deal with 10 Pacific nations, but this was shelved at a meeting between Beijing and Pacific leaders in May.Samoan Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa said the agreements were similar in intent, but added that the US had been more willing to negotiate with the Pacific as a whole.Initially, only Pacific countries that had formal diplomatic ties with the US were invited to this week's summit, which excluded Cook Islands, Niue, New Caledonia or French Polynesia.However the invitation was extended to those countries and territories, as well as Australia and New Zealand, after lobbying from Pacific Island leaders.""We've been insisting that if partners wish to talk to us, collectively, then they need to do it through the modalities of the Pacific [Islands] Forum,"" Fiame said.""When the Chinese were proposing something similar, we were giving them that message, but it didn't seem to filter through or they weren't willing to take that on board.""Fiame said the declaration between Pacific countries and the US was ""pretty general"" and prioritised climate change, which is seen as the region's biggest security threat.She said there were also significant discussions about maritime security.""Not only the protection of the fisheries, but also the maritime boundaries,"" she said.The Samoan prime minister pressed the importance of maintaining peace in the region, and said she would not like to see increased US military presence in the Pacific.""When you begin to talk about defence, you're sort of looking at scenarios where other countries or forces will be coming into the Pacific,"" she said.""We wouldn't like to encourage that in any way.""Other nations are pushing for more economic investment from the US.""Our biggest investment partner right now is China … it shouldn't be that way,"" said Palau President Surangel Whipps Junior. ""We don't even have diplomatic relations with China. But the number one investors are coming from China. Before COVID-19, the number one tourists were from China.""Mr Whipps said climate change was stifling his country's economic development.""Palau was actually making some progress, I'd say in 2010,"" he said.""We were on the right trajectory to go somewhere, then what do we get here? Three typhoons in the last 10 years, which we never had before.""Every time we tried to dig ourselves out of the hole, we've got problems with climate change that send us backwards.""Mr Whipps said he hoped the meeting with Mr Biden would be ""more than just a photo opportunity at the White House"".""I hope it's substantial programs and initiatives that really build that partnership,"" he said.Director of the Lowy Institute's Pacific Islands Program Meg Keen agreed the US summit with Pacific leaders was very significant, but must lead to real outcomes.""The signing of the declaration is important because it's a signal. But more important is what actually gets delivered over time,"" Dr Keen said.""There have been promises, in fact, on a number of these types of topics in the past, and there hasn't been strong delivery.""She said it was encouraging to see US open embassies in Pacific Island nations, including Solomon Islands, Kiribati and Tonga.But she said financing promises made in this week's summit would be a challenge for Washington.""Those commitments have to be translated into action, and that needs financing, and the financing has to go to Congress and it has to be approved,"" she said.""There can be quite a lag time between the provenance and the delivery.""Dr Keen said there were key differences between the US-Pacific declaration and China's proposed trade and security deal with the region.""There's some overlap, and we can see that in climate change, economic development, and so on,"" she said.""I think what the United States is trying to show is a strong commitment to development, and they're trying to pull back on security.""The regional proposal with the Pacific [and China] … had a much stronger security element to it.""","China, Foreign Affairs, Kiribati, New Zealand, Pacific, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Treaties and Alliances, United States, World Politics, ",2022-09-27 18:44:32+00:00

It's a great opportunity,"" she said. Ms Faao came to the farm through the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme, where Australian businesses can recruit workers from nine pacific countries and Timor Leste. Farm owner Lachlan Marshall turned to the scheme after COVID-19 border closures cut off the supply of backpacker labour, leaving him desperate for people to help milk his 900 cows. ""[The cows have] got to be milked every single day and we milk three times a day,"" he said. ""Anyone who knows dairy cows, if you're five minutes outside of a routine they're very unhappy.""""We went through a very long and painful process to be registered under the PALM scheme and we have eight Pacific Island employees here at the moment."" Mr Marshall said not only are the workers essential for his business but he was happy to help them set their lives up in Australia, so they can support their families back home. ""These are people coming from somewhere where they're desperately looking for work, opportunities,"" he said.  ""I'm kind of proud when they show me photos of their homes where they're building a new house, or they've put a fence up to say that the toddler can't go onto the road or things like that.""Paea Faao's husband also works at the dairy farm. She said the opportunity allowed them to help their family back home. ""We can provide anything they want, they can call us [with] what they need and we can just send them money,"" she said. Mr Marshall said only one of the workers had milked a cow before they arrived at his farm, but now they were all settled in. ""There is nothing more exciting or heartwarming than when you walk into a dairy and you can hear them singing as they're milking,"" he said. Mr Marshall is leading a push to get Ukrainian refugees working on his farm and in the region to help ease worker shortages and provide them with a safe place to live. ""It's a tough time over there, people are doing it really tough and if there's an opportunity for me to help out, help them and help ourselves at the same time, well, why can't we all come together and solve a problem?"" he said. Phil Stone, the general manager of Edward River Council, which encompasses Blighty, said bringing Ukrainian refugees to the region was a ""fantastic"" idea. He said the council would facilitate a meeting between the Ukrainian Association of Melbourne and prospective employers. ""Not only is it a great humanitarian gesture, but it's also great economically because we'll be able to attract people to come here, work and be members of the community,"" Mr Stone said. ""Ukraine is a very similar economy to Australia, particularly in the rural areas of Australia [with a] heavy farming, agricultural economy.""There are some real clear synergies and parallels between what they are used to doing and what we would like them to do.""Editor's note 13/9/2022: A previous version of this story said Paea Faao sent money to her family in Samoa.

He would go on to play a pivotal role in bringing Polynesians to play rugby union in Australia.In those days, there were no Pacific islanders in the Australian side.Tupi, 72, was a colossus of a man in his playing days, standing 192 centimetres tall and weighing 120 kilograms.He died on August 19 after a battle with illness and was laid to rest at the weekend in a traditional ceremony in Woodridge, south of Brisbane, attended by hundreds of people.Sinitela Sarchet recalls her father talking about that famous game.But she said it was a long time before she understood how much it meant to the Tongan people.""He actually said that he was quite famous in Tonga,"" she said.""It wasn't until we got into our teens that we understood how important he was and how important that Tongan team at the time was for that whole nation.""Three years after that match at Ballymore, Tupi moved to Australia on a working visa alongside Fatai Kefu, father of Wallaby veteran Toutai Kefu.Both players were lured to the Souths Magpies in Brisbane, a team that was struggling at the time.""At the end of the 1975 season we'd won one game and got mercilessly belted every week,"" Souths Magpies Peter ""Doubles"" Daley remembered.""Tom Feao, who was a Tongan hooker who played for us, said he could get his mates from Tonga.""Three of them arrived next year, two of them test players, being Fa'aleo Tupi and Fatai Kefu.""The morning they arrived, we were playing a trial game against Brothers — and they insisted on playing.""They hopped straight off the plane and we beat Brothers 7-4 that afternoon.

I'm trying not to show my emotions but it's a big relief to get the win,"" Tonga captain Sonatane Takulua said after the match.When the full-time siren sounded, a sea of red erupted and tears flowed easily.Even for the Tongan supporters — who have a reputation for being 'extra' — it was on another level because it was not about the World Cup qualification: it was about feeling like winners again.Tonga lost all three of its previous matches in the Pacific Nations Cup, with its trio of star recruits proving to be fizzers.Israel Folau is sidelined for months with a hamstring injury after playing only 30 minutes in Fiji.Malakai Fekitoa went back to his Irish club with a calf concern and Charles Piutau only committed to two Pacific Nations matches, one being Tonga's shocking 30-0 loss to Fiji.It had begun to feel like a curse on the 'Ikale Tahi.But all of that was a distant memory as the curtains closed on an entertaining clash with Hong Kong on Saturday night.Tonga made an aggressive start — perhaps too aggressive — with two tries disallowed in the opening 10 minutes following a knock-on and an obstruction play.But it did not take long for Takulua to put one on the board that stuck, sniping at the ruck for the first try of the match.Hong Kong replied immediately and scored its first try through some slick passing that saw hooker Alex Post go over for a five-pointer in the corner.Takulua continued to lead from the front, quickly scoring his second try in identical fashion to the first.It looked like the crowd was in for a real game of rugby. There was a bit of drama later in the first half following an exciting sprint from Hong Kong fullback Nate De Thierry that saw play move into the Tongan 22.In the ensuring passage of play, Tonga hooker Siua Maile illegally tried to slow the ball down at the ruck and was shown a yellow card, leaving his side with 14 players for 10 minutes.Gregor McNeish kicked a penalty goal, closing the gap on the scoreboard to just nine points.Despite this, Hong Kong got stuck in a defensive pattern of play and failed to take any advantage out of Tonga being a player down. Hong Kong did not score again in the first half.At this point, the Tongans were feeling so confident they began making creative decisions, such as 150-kilogram prop Ben Tameifuna throwing in at a line-out, which raised a few eyebrows.The Tongans came flying out of the blocks in the second half with two tries in the opening 10 minutes.The first to Takulua iced his hat-trick, then a textbook maul pushed Siegfried Fisi'ihoi over the line. The score was now 30-8.A scrum secured multiple penalties in the opposing 22 for Tonga, with winger Telusa Veainu finishing off a set-piece move, before fellow winger Anzelo Tuitavuki scored a try after a 65-metre line break down the flank.This was the last try for Tonga. William Havili nailed his fourth conversion of the match, with the score moving to 44-8.Havili had also kicked two penalty goals in the first half.The last 10 minutes of the match were thrilling.First, Tima Fainga'anuku put a massive hit on Hong Kong captain Josh Hrstich with the kind of tackle Pacific Islanders are feared for.You could hear the impact from the grandstand and Hrstich was left winded on the ground.Hong Kong kept fighting, despite knowing the match was gone.Winger Matthew Worley scored two late converted tries, making the final score 44-22 in favour of Tonga.Tonga's set-pieces, scrum and maul all displayed an elite level of clinical rugby. The Tongan front and back rows were stunning, simply outclassing Hong Kong.As the Little Kingdom's diaspora made their way home on Saturday night, all the Aunties, Fa'e, the Tami and the Tamai had big smiles because they knew sleep would come easy that night.Their boys were winners again.","Hong Kong, Rugby Union, Rugby Union World Cup, Sport, Tonga, ",2022-07-24 09:02:47+00:00

I said, 'let me think about it.'""I spoke to my husband — we'd been out of football for a little while at that point — but decided we'd like to give something back to the country and to the OFC, because they've helped us and have always been wonderful.""So I said, 'OK, sure. Let's give it a go.'""What followed was a journey that even Selby, with her many decades of globe-trotting experience, could not have anticipated. And it all started before she even got there.Tonga was one of many Pacific nations that went into total international lockdown during the pandemic. As a result, Selby's first year in charge of the Tongan women's national team happened largely via Zoom, email, and phone calls. She would take PCR tests every month and was up-to-date with all her vaccinations, just in case there was the slightest chance she could be flown over at short notice.""It was really hard not knowing any of the players, not being able to watch what they were doing, not knowing their capabilities,"" she said.""I'd put together training sessions and programs for them. They were training with the technical director in Tonga, playing games against boys, and they'd write to me or we'd talk over the phone about what we'd have to do.""They didn't play a single international game for basically a whole year.""In January of this year, pandemic restrictions looked to be easing and Selby prepared herself to move to the small island nation. But that's when Tonga experienced another unexpected disaster.About 65km north-west of its capital, Nuku'alofa, an underwater volcano known as Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai erupted.The explosion sent a tower of gas and ash so high into the atmosphere that it touched the edge of space, becoming the largest volcanic plume ever captured by satellites.It generated so much energy that the atmospheric waves it emitted were the fastest modern science has recorded, travelling around the earth six times at speeds ""very close to the theoretical limit"". The sonic boom could be heard as far as the United States.It also caused a tsunami that swept across parts of Tonga, wiping out homes and businesses, carrying boats and boulders into the main streets of towns. Fortunately, the country's main football facilities were spared: the giant waves cracked against the coral reef shelf and dispersed elsewhere along the western coastline.Selby arrived in Tonga a few weeks later, only to realise that COVID had arrived, too — introduced on the aid ships sent by other nations to help with the clean-up.Hundreds of unvaccinated Tongans fell ill. Some died. The entire country was plunged into lockdown, including strict curfews. All sport, including their fledgling women's league, stopped. Selby spent her first month in Nuku'alofa staring at the four walls of her apartment, or out to sea.With the Women's Nations Cup just five months away, Selby had to do something — anything — to prepare her team to potentially claim one of the only Oceania spots available.Then, out of the blue, an invitation by former Matildas coach Alen Stajcic to take part in a series of friendlies against the Philippines renewed her hopes.But nothing has been easy for Selby and Tonga lately, and getting back to Australia for the April games was no different.""We got the girls into a camp for a week,"" Selby said. ""We weren't allowed to train [because of lockdown], but we got them together, tested them every day, and they were all clear.""So we'd get up at five o'clock on the morning — it was still dark — and they'd go for runs. Just to get fit.""We'd do things like that, all while keeping our distance.""We'd do that in the early morning and late at night, but you had to be careful nobody saw you otherwise we may have got in trouble.""But when we were supposed to leave, something happened with the plane: the one we were supposed to get on just didn't happen. So we ended up getting our flights pushed back and missed the first game because we couldn't get there.""We were up at 3am to get a flight from Fiji to Sydney, the girls hadn't had any breakfast, and with the time difference, we arrived in Australia around 11. By the time we got through customs and baggage, it was around one o'clock. Then the bus couldn't get out of the airport because the boom gates weren't working.""By the time we got to our accommodation, it was probably 2:30pm, and we had a game at five. The girls are starving, they're exhausted, it's cold and raining. When we got to the field, the organisers said we all had to do COVID and passport checks — even though we'd just done them to get into the country.""By the time we went out to warm up, it was probably 15 minutes before kick-off.""The two-digit score-line in the first game was no surprise in light of their tumultuous preparation, but the 92nd-ranked side only lost the second match 5-0 against a Philippines team who had already qualified for next year's Women's World Cup.""They never gave up,"" Selby said. ""They kept fighting to the last minute. We made mistakes, yes — silly things through tiredness, no food, all the travel. But they held their heads up high. They did really well.""This story alone illustrates the wider challenges that many women's national teams continue to face across the Pacific.Unsuitable facilities (Tonga's main football complex doesn't have floodlights), vast distances, unreliable travel, a lack of equipment, few specialised staff members like goalkeeper coaches and physiotherapists, and the unpredictable natural environment all play a major role in how these Oceania countries are able to engage in the global game.Many OFC nations rely on donations from wealthier countries and investment from governing bodies above them, especially FIFA, who have contributed money and personnel to develop ""Just Play"" programs and coach education courses across Tonga.Indeed, they're one of the only Pacific nations to have two women's development officers who help deliver football initiatives throughout Tonga's various islands.Selby sees the parallels between where women's football is in Tonga now and where it was when she played back in the 1970s.""I remember training on a soccer field with maybe one light — a street light — and cars lined up nearby to light up the field,"" she said.""That was probably the early 1970s. That's what we were given. But things got better and better: more money came in, more support from clubs. But it's still so tough for these girls. They want to succeed, they want to play well. They want to do their country proud.""But they're lacking the same things we didn't have. We want to help them get up off the ground, to give them quality coaches, to make sure people look after them.""One of the people looking after them is their major patron, Princess Lātūfuipeka of Tonga's royal family.While visiting the team in Sydney, she gave them the nickname ""Mataliki"": a Polynesian word meaning ""eyes of the god"", named after the Pleiades cluster of stars that marks the Māori lunar new year. They're the only Tongan national team she has given a name to.The Women's Nations Cup in Fiji is now in full swing, with the side going down 2-0 to Samoa in their first group match. The side has been whacked by COVID once again, with their best striker and sturdiest centre-back in isolation.They take on the Cook Islands on Saturday, with the top two teams advancing to the knock-outs. The absence of perennial winners New Zealand, who qualified for 2023 automatically as co-hosts, means a new Oceania champion will be crowned and offered a shot at a Women's World Cup debut.But even if they don't qualify for the expanded 32-team tournament next year, which they'd have to do by winning an intercontinental play-off tournament in February, Selby — alongside Jim, who's now in charge of the men's programs — hopes to leave the kind of legacy she did in Australia four decades ago.""It'll be interesting to see what happens afterwards: whether this legacy continues on or whether they go, 'oh, we're not going to make it now, let's not bother,'"" she said.""But there is so much potential here. I loved representing my country; to me, it was the biggest pleasure of my life. For these girls, they don't have the money, they don't have the facilities. Not just them, but so many other countries as well.""We've got so much out of sport, out of football. We've travelled the world; we've seen things we wouldn't have seen unless we were involved.""We wanted to give something back to the sport and the countries that have given so much to us.""We didn't want to just go there, coach, and then leave. We both want to leave a legacy.""If these kids went to a World Cup, they wouldn't know what to do with themselves. It would just be mind-boggling for them. So many of them are still teenagers, so many of them have barely even left Tonga before.""We're getting ready, I reckon, for the next one. If the team can stay together, keep training, play more games, maybe they can do well. All we can do is try.""","Australia, Soccer, Sport, Tonga, ",2022-07-14 20:37:05+00:00

The older generation still have a strong link to where they grew up,"" Mr Vakasiuola said.""But slowly we are trying to convince them they have to do it for their grandchildren and their children.""Tonga Red Cross secretary-general Sione Taumoefolau said from what he's heard from locals, ""it's a 50-50 of people who want to go and those who want to stay"".But he believes this is the best solution, with the new village designed to withstand a category-4 cyclone. ""It's good to look at a better approach for the future instead of building in the same area that can be destroyed again,"" he said.Reverend Toetu'u said most of the people from his community are aware that it isn't safe to return to their island and are fine with relocating, but he worries about their livelihoods.When he returned to Mango Island recently, all he salvaged was one fishing boat — from their fleet of nine — which had been flung to the top of a hill by a wave. ""The government promised they will replace all of the boats, so we're still hoping that that will happen,"" Reverend Toetu'u said. The community is grateful for all the food, clothing and supplies the government has provided, but assistance obtaining boats is that next crucial element of support, he added. Concerns have been raised for the mental health and social impacts associated with losing identity and having to start a new life.Mr Vakasiuola said there is a complementary plan to support those who are in the new settlement.But Drew Havea from the Civil Society Forum of Tonga (CSFT) — an umbrella organisation for NGOs — believes more needs to be done now to improve communication between the government and people displaced. ""There's been very little consultation on the whole relocation from a civil society perspective. There needs to be more consultation,"" he told the ABC. ""What we need is a clear policy on dislocation and relocation of people. We need to have a road map on what this means so people understand."" The CSFT is trying to ensure a support network will be in place at the new village. In the meantime, they have been getting materials for weaving and other past-times to evacuation centres so people have ways to spend their days and generate income. Although time is taking its toll and there is some relocation resistance, Mr Havea says overall there is a sense of hope.""Hope and faith that what they are waiting for will be much better than where they came from,"" he said.""I think that is keeping them sustained.""The resettlement project is just one part of the nation's recovery effort, which Mr Vakasiuola says is coming along slowly.""In terms of food security and the livelihood of people it's pretty fast,"" he said. ""The slow part is the construction of infrastructures we have identified; it is the nature of the beast."" Crystal Áke, a safeguard coordinator for the MORDI Tonga Trust, said the slowdown of the rebuilding effort was largely due to the COVID-19 outbreak.The NGO, which helps vulnerable communities in rural areas, had to halt a lot of their initial work due to COVID risks.""The community as well, at large, they were very apprehensive,"" Ms Áke said.""They knew what COVID could do, they've seen it, we've seen it happen in Fiji. And so a lot of them actually requested that we halt a lot of the work that we were supposed to do.""Ms Áke expects resettling communities displaced by the eruption will ""take some time"".""So moving forward, we are actually targeting a lot of these communities to get them into food and water security, before we move on to resettlement,"" she said.  Last month, the World Bank pledged an additional $US20 million ($28 million) to bolster the country's recovery efforts. Tonga's Finance Minister Tatafu Moeaki said the disasters had led to an ""unanticipated financing gap,"" and he welcomed the extra support five months on.He said it will help them better prepare for and mitigate against disasters and climate-related emergencies.Australia has also provided support packages of up to $19 million since January and sent Australian Defence Force personnel to assist with clean-up efforts, and deliver equipment and disaster relief supplies.Despite the challenges, Ms Áke is optimistic Tonga is on the path to recovery and that things are returning to normal.""I feel as if Tonga is making good progress … in assisting each other. I think we're making the best of what we have at the moment and what we can do,"" she said.""Our spirits are higher because we see that the community themselves are always very proactive. And so I think that's one of the best things that we can see is that people are still in high spirits.""Mr Havea has also witnessed the community finding innovative ways to grow crops, saying some of the agriculture recovery on the main island has been ""quite amazing"".""A lot of the women's groups are standing up and planting vegetables,"" he said. ""I think that is something quite new, that we are seeing the participation of women in agriculture.""He said they will continue to provide planting materials and equipment to assist with farming. ""The resilience of the communities is quite clear, it's just how we can support them.""","Asia, Community and Society, Disasters and Accidents, Foreign Aid, Pacific, Tonga, Tsunamis, Volcanic Eruptions, ",2022-07-14 19:50:14+00:00

That doesn't change the relationship we have with Australia or their understanding of our position.""Ms Ardern has been in Australia this week for her second meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as well as meetings with state premiers.Australia plans to acquire nuclear-powered submarines — but not nuclear-armed — some time in the 2030s or 2040s, through a technology transfer under the AUKUS security pact with the United Kingdom and the United States.A contract with a specific supplier is yet to be finalised.The UN's nuclear watchdog is the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, has also been in Australia this week for preliminary talks on the technical details of an inspection regime for the future submarines.""In this case, it is a complex thing to do because we are talking about a vessel – a vessel that goes out in the seas for long periods of time,"" Mr Grossi said. ""So, we have to find ways around that fact, for our inspectors to be able to ascertain that the nuclear material loaded into the ship is there when it comes back to shore.""Ms Ardern was also asked about a recent security pact struck between Solomon Islands and China, which some analysts warn could provide a pretext for the basing of Chinese troops or vessels in the Pacific Island nation.The Solomon Islands government has repeatedly ruled out a military base.""We've been very clear that we're opposed to the militarisation of the region. But look, you know, we can take that position in a country-neutral way,"" Ms Ardern said.""We believe that escalation in our region and a militarisation in our region is not necessary, not called for, and not wanted. So we're very clear on that.""Asked if New Zealand would join Australia in increasing its defence capability in response to China's military expansion, Ms Ardern said it was up to Australia to explain its own rationale for its defence strategy.New Zealand's defence policy would remain ""Pacific-focused"", she said.Ferguson asked the New Zealand PM if she had now ""moved beyond"" neutrality on China, citing her participation in recent North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) talks.NATO has declared China a security challenge for the first time in its official strategic documents.""I think it's important not to confuse the term 'country-neutral' with neutrality, or not entering into the fray on foreign policy issues as they emerge,"" Ms Ardern said.""When we talk in that way, the point we're making is we have a very strong set of values.""And, actually, it's not about targeting any one individual country.""If we see others who don't share those values and breach, for instance, the international rules-based order, we will speak up about that.""Ms Ardern said she had ""pushed back"" on the idea that the Solomon Islands deal had blindsided Australia and New Zealand, and represented an intelligence failure.""I feel that doesn't acknowledge the sovereignty of Pacific Island nations to determine their own relationships,"" she said.""It is not for New Zealand, or Australia, to dictate the relationships that Pacific Island neighbours have with others.""She said China pursuing closer ties with Pacific Island nations was not a new phenomenon and that Solomon Islands had been on a ""trajectory"" of closer links with Beijing over a ""number of years"".Watch 7.30's full interview with Jacinda Ardern tonight on ABC TV and ABC iview.","Foreign Affairs, New Zealand, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Unrest, Conflict and War, World Politics, ",2022-07-07 08:30:00+00:00

Six thousand metres beneath the surface, who's watching?""But in Lisbon, explicit support from other countries for a temporary ban on ocean-floor mining on the high seas, outside of national territorial waters known as exclusive economic zones (EEZs), was scarce.Chile stepped up, calling for a 15-year pause to allow for more research.The United States, along with other developed nations, took a more ambiguous stance, calling for scientific evaluation of environmental impacts but not closing the door to future mining.""We haven't taken an official position on it,"" US climate envoy John Kerry told AFP in an interview.""But we have expressed deep concerns about adequately researching the impacts of any deep-sea mining, and we have not approved any.""To the surprise of many in Lisbon, France's President Emmanuel Macron appeared to endorse a halt to deep-sea mining on the seas, despite the fact that France holds mining exploration licenses from ISA, the intergovernmental body overseeing exploitation of the ocean floor.""I think we have, indeed, to create the legal framework to stop the high-sea mining and not to allow new activities putting in danger these ecosystems,"" Mr Macron said at a side event.""We have to promote our scientists and explorers to better know and discover these high seas.""Deep-sea mining opponents were thrilled with the statement, but are waiting to see what follows.""Is the French government going to put in the diplomatic effort in order to make what he said they'll do actually happen? We'll see,"" said Matthew Gianni, co-founder of Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.The clock is ticking because last year Nauru, in cooperation with The Metals Company, triggered a rule requiring the ISA to finalise regulations for high-seas mining worldwide within two years.The ISA, criticised for lacking transparency and favouring corporate interests, meets later this month in Kingston, Jamaica.Sources say they are likely to try to push through draft regulations which, if adopted, could see mining operations licensed by this time next year.ABC/wires","Kiribati, Mining Environmental Issues, Mining and Metals Industry, Nauru, Palau, Tonga, World Politics, ",2022-07-02 02:14:09+00:00

Tonga will almost definitely get them for the World Cup, but not when there's a blue jersey to be worn in Perth.It wasn't Moeaki Fotuaika or Joe Ofahengaue either, although they were important as well. The two props missed out on selection in the top 17 due to the quality of forwards available, a fair wrap given the two were playing for the Maroons this time last year and a mark of the increasing talent pool the Tongans have at their disposal.For the first time since he made his historic defection, it's not even Jason Taumalolo. The Cowboys lock changed international rugby league forever when he switched from New Zealand to Tonga in 2017, turning the Pacific Island nation into a powerhouse who have since beaten New Zealand, Great Britain and Australia.The pandemic warped everyone's perceptions of time and cost rugby league its best chance of capitalising on Tonga's rise – that 2017 World Cup and Tonga's run to the semifinals and the vision of Mt Smart Stadium turning into a singing sea of red flags for the semifinal against England, one of the greatest Test matches ever played, doesn't feel like it was five years ago.But it was, and the passage of time is why the most important Tongan players in Young's squad are potential debutants Talatau Amone, Tolotau Koula and Will Penisini.All three of them seem like stars of the future, but they are still at the beginning of their rugby league careers – Koula and Penisni are just 19, while Amone is the elder statesman of the group at 20.That means they were in their mid-teens when they saw Taumalolo pick up the red jersey over the black and white, when they saw Siosuia Taukeiaho, Manu Ma'u, Andrew Fifita and David Fusitu'a follow Taumalolo's lead, when they witnessed Tonga's brutalising win over New Zealand in Waikato and their gallant defeat to England in that semifinal.Their formative rugby league memories aren't just packed with NRL moments and Origin series, but also of Tongan triumphs.Players like Amone and Koula and Penisini are the final by-product of Taumalolo's decision all those years ago, the ripple effect we could not perceive back then but surely knew must have been coming.They are the first of the new generation, the sons of a tomorrow that was promised five years ago and has finally arrived.Taumalolo was always going to play well for Tonga — when he made his switch, he was arguably the best player in the world and certainly the best forward.Fifita had come off a brilliant Origin series for the Blues and was selected in the Kangaroos squad before coming home. Ma'u was one of the best backrowers in the league and Taukeiaho one of the best props. Fusitu'a was a year off becoming the NRL's top try scorer.It was as close to a golden generation of talent as Tonga were likely ever to get, but golden generations don't always keep glittering once everyone grows up and gets old and moves on.Coming across a boon of talented players who are all the same age is a blessing, but to make the most of that blessing it has to be converted into something more sustainable.That's easier said than done, and there's no exact formula for it, but Tonga has the chance to do it.Want more Origin news and analysis? Sign up for our State of Origin newsletterTaumalolo and Tuakeiaho are the only members of that original five who have been named in Tonga's top 17 for next weekend. Fifita is in the extended squad but seems to have moved into the same elder statesman role he plays for the Sharks. Ma'u and Fusitu'a are in Super League and should make the World Cup squad, although competition will be fierce.The Tongan side finally has a past that was put up in lights and can be easily and fondly remembered, and the benefit of that comes in the future, in players like Amone, Koula and Penisini, and other potential debutants like Haumole Olakau'atu and Keaon Koloamatangi, who weren't there as players when the revolution began but were there as Tongans.The red jersey always meant a lot, back to the days Tonga played their first matches in the 1980s. It meant history and family and connecting to one's culture and giving back to the community that meant so much.But now, there are also past glories to celebrate and those glories inspire the next generation of players to emulate their heroes and create a legacy of their own.And they can talk about those games from 2017 and beyond the same way Queenslanders talk about 1995 and the eight in a row, the same way New South Wales fans talk about 2014 and Bryan Fletcher's hand grenade, and the same way, in generations past when a Test jersey was the pinnacle of the sport, Australian fans would remember the Rorke's Drift Test and the Swinton Massacre and the Invincibles and the Unbeatables and all the other great Kangaroo sides.The past can be more than history and memory if it's used as the fuel that fires the present into the future.That's how a golden generation becomes more than just a good tournament or two or a handy win here and there.That's why Amone and Koula and Penisini, and other young players like 19-year-old halfback Isaiaya Katoa, are so important.Their Tongan careers are beginning in a brand-new world, a world where Tonga can stand up to anybody and bow to nobody, a world where Tonga isn't a stepping stone to something greater – they're just something great.","NRL, Rugby League, Sport, Tonga, ",2022-06-16 19:01:09+00:00

The ABC has approached the Solomon Islands Ministry of Foreign Affairs and External Trade for comment.During Mr Wang's visit, Kiribati signed 10 documents to ""elevate cooperation"" on the BRI, climate change, livelihood projects, disaster risk reduction, road infrastructure, tourism, the dispatching of medical teams, COVID-19 supplies and marine transportation for the Line Islands.Additionally, Global Times, an English-language Chinese state media tabloid, reported cooperation agreements on trade, renewable energy and customs inspection were signed.The Kiribati government said it would release details of the visit later.When the Chinese delegation touched down in Kiribati last month, the atoll nation was focused on trade and tourism opportunities with China and was not keen on a security arrangement, according to a Kiribati official who was not authorised to speak to the media.While there had been much speculation over a controversial plan to reopen a protected marine zone for commercial fishing, and to upgrade a World War II-era airstrip on Canton Island, the official said these were not among the agreements due to be signed. Since switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in 2019, Kiribati has said it would open the 400,000 square-kilometre Phoenix Islands Protected Area — one of the world's largest marine conservation zones — to fishing.Western critics have expressed concern the Chinese plan to upgrade the airstrip would offer Beijing a foothold about 3,000km south-west of the US state of Hawaii. Kiribati said it would be a non-military project designed to bolster tourism. Papua New Guinea has had diplomatic ties with China since 1976, a year after becoming independent from Australia.It's the largest recipient of both Chinese and Australian aid.But some projects China has promised and not yet delivered.One is a $US4.1 billion ($5.7 billion) road project, which would upgrade 11 roads and connect all regions of the country.""If it eventuates, it would be the largest Chinese aid project in Pacific history,"" said the Lowy Institute's Alexandre Dayant.Another is the Ramu 2 hydropower plant, to which China has committed a potential $US920 million — if it goes ahead.""China's involvement in the Pacific through development support serves a double purpose,"" said Mr Dayant, who has mapped development funding flows in the Lowy Pacific Aid Map.""First, it answers a profound development need from the region … However, China's support isn't free and understanding its intent is important.""It is also important to mention that China isn't the only one using aid policies as leverage for favours. Australia's aid program, like New Zealand's and other western countries, often comes with strings attached.""Another aim of China's engagement in the region is to garner support on the world stage.Dr Newton Cain said investing in development needs meant China — and other donors — could build political capital when they wanted support at the United Nations, for example.In 2020, PNG backed China at the UN over its controversial national security law in Hong Kong.""It would be naive to think that China does this simply for altruistic purposes, just as it would be naive to think anybody else does it simply for altruistic purposes,"" she said.Graeme Smith, senior fellow at the ANU's Department of Pacific Affairs, said Solomon Islands was ""at the centre of this panic about Chinese bases"" now but a few years ago, that space was held by Vanuatu.Vanuatu's former ambassador to China, Sela Molisa, recently told the ABC's Pacific Beat program the 83-island nation desperately needed several development projects, including airports, roads and wharves.It was a wharf that raised eyebrows back in 2018.The $114 million Chinese-funded project is deep enough for cruise ships but also naval vessels to dock.Reports swirled that Beijing was seeking to build a permanent military base in the Pacific and was eyeing Vanuatu.Vanuatu's Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu strenuously denied it at the time.""No-one in the Vanuatu government has ever talked about a Chinese military base in Vanuatu of any sort,"" he said.""We are a non-aligned country. We are not interested in militarisation, we are just not interested in any sort of military base in our country.""Vanuatu government spokesperson Fred Vurobaravu reiterated there was no plan for a Chinese military base in Santo – which was a US naval base during World War II — ""and that position will remain unchanged"".He said it was one of the largest wharves in the South Pacific and Vanuatu was fortunate to have it.Dr Newton Cain said talk of a Chinese military base in the region was speculation.""There isn't actually any evidence of that yet. We haven't seen a military base being established anywhere in the Pacific,"" she said.""That may happen. It may happen in the next five years. It may happen in the next 10 years. It may never happen.""She said Pacific leaders had made it clear that what threatened their security was not China, but climate change, and they did not want to be caught up in other nations' geopolitical competition.""[Pacific leaders have said], 'We don't want to be used as pawns on a chessboard. We're not a prize to be fought over.'""Another project causing some anxiety was a proposed Chinese-backed port in Vaiusu Bay, Samoa.Samoa's Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa scrapped the $128 million project shortly after winning the 2021 election, saying there were ""more pressing projects"".She said the level of Samoa's indebtedness to China had been a concern for voters.As of last year, China was the largest lender to Samoa, which owed Beijing about 40 per cent of its total debt, around $200 million.A Reuters analysis in 2018 found China's lending to the Pacific went from nearly zero to $US1.3 billion in a decade, and that Chinese loans accounted for around half of the external debt burden in Vanuatu and Tonga.Vanuatu's government spokesperson told the ABC he could not disclose the current debt owed to China, but said some past loans had been forgiven.Mr Dayant said that China had not engaged in deliberate debt trap diplomacy yet and while indebtedness was a risk for Pacific economies, the reality was more nuanced.At the same time, the sheer size of Chinese lending meant that it was an intense share of smaller countries' GDPs, and he said that if China wanted to avoid accusations of debt entrapment, it should change its approach to be more sustainable.Pacific nations have ""risen to the complexity that is Chinese lending"", he added.""Less and less Chinese loans are signed by PICs [Pacific Island countries], mostly because they have limited fiscal space available after a pandemic that is still having a big impact on the region,"" he said.But another key area of Chinese support to Samoa — and to the Pacific more broadly — is health.Beijing said it had dispatched 600 medical staff to Pacific nations, provided 600,000 doses of vaccines and more than 100 tonnes of medical supplies.For Samoa, that includes around half a million US dollars in COVID assistance for masks and other PPE.But medical assistance also pre-dates the pandemic, with medical training in China and almost $US1 million in medical equipment for a Samoan hospital, including an X-ray machine, ultrasound machines and ear, nose and throat diagnostic equipment.One of the most significant projects China has funded in the Pacific is the rebuilding of the CBD in Nuku'alofa, Tonga's capital, following pro-democracy riots in 2006.Beijing provided a loan of more than $US100 million for the rebuild.In 2020, Reuters reported that almost two-thirds of Tonga's external debt of $US186 million was owed to China, according to budget statements.But China has also highlighted its aid and relief efforts in the Pacific following cyclones and natural disasters.One of the most shocking incidents was the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano — the biggest explosion since Krakatoa in 1883.It triggered a tsunami that damaged large swathes of Tonga and left much of the country covered in volcanic ash, and also severed an underwater communications cable.""The Chinese government was highly concerned and acted immediately, making China the first country in the world to provide assistance to Tonga,"" China's Foreign Ministry said.Tonga said China had donated $US1.3 million in cash and relief and restoration assistance since the eruption, while the Australian government said it delivered a total of 370 tonnes of emergency supplies and pledged a $16 million package for Tonga's long-term recovery.As Mr Dayant from the Lowy Institute points out, Pacific Island countries' vulnerability to national disasters makes it one of the most aid-dependent regions in the world and its location in a highly-contested ocean makes it a focus of strategic thinking. When Frank Bainimarama seized control of Fiji in a military coup in 2006, Western sanctions and a diplomatic deep freeze swiftly followed.But China threw a lifeline to Fiji — its pledged aid skyrocketed and its diplomatic ties deepened.Australia re-engaged after elections were held in 2014. Mr Bainimarama won and has since transformed into a leading voice on the climate crisis facing the Pacific.""Geopolitical point-scoring means less than little to anyone whose community is slipping beneath the rising seas,"" he said in a press conference last week after it became clear a consensus had not been reached on the sweeping China-proposed agreement.While China — the most populous country — is the world's biggest polluter, some of its involvement in the Pacific has focused on climate change.Earlier this year, Beijing unveiled the China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Action Cooperation Centre.China also provided funds to Fiji in response to a series of cyclones, as well as $US1.4 million to build a sea wall to protect against rising ocean levels.""Now, they are well established in the Pacific. Chinese aid has done its job,"" Mr Dayant said.He said Chinese aid also provided a vehicle to implement state-owned enterprises in the region.Dr Newton Cain added that the state-owned enterprises had ""evolved and modified"" to become part of the business community in some countries.That included bidding for local contracts, workers living in the country and sending their children to school there, and supporting local football teams.""They are becoming part of the environment in which they work,"" she said.Some Fijians told the Associated Press they saw a benefit to Chinese foreign investment in the country, as long as it uplifted people.One of them, Georgina Matilda, said working for Chinese infrastructure company China Railway meant she could put food on the table for her children.Dr Newton Cain said there was a move away from donors flying in their own workers solely, as countries were increasingly concerned about whether infrastructure projects would lead to local jobs.""These big Chinese companies are recognising that is something that people are watching,"" she said.""In small economies, a couple of big road-building projects … you would expect there to be significant spillover effects, so that … it is actually injecting some cash into the local economy.""Niue's Premier and Foreign Minister Dalton Tagelagi met with Mr Wang via a video call last month, and the Chinese government said both sides pledged to ""deepen bilateral cooperation including on the Belt and Road Initiative"". It said the two countries had signed documents that would boost cooperation on infrastructure and broadcasting as well as ""expand the blue economy and the biopharmaceutical corporation"" — but what this looked like in reality was unclear.Niue is a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand and has had diplomatic relations with China since 2007 — its second-largest trade partner.Niue has a population of approximately 1,600 and a landmass of just 261 square kilometres but lays claim to an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Pacific Ocean that's about the size of Vietnam.While little is known about the ins and outs of agreements between Niue and China, Dr Smith said China's efforts were likely aimed at keeping Niue onside.""To some extent … it's just about Taiwan,"" he said.""Territorial integrity is still the main driver of their strategy in the region ... reducing Taiwan's diplomatic spaces there has always been right up there.""So you paid the minimum to keep them in your camp.""Cook Islands is reported to have a number of projects with China assisting the island nation in a range of areas including public services, education and the fishing industry.Among them are public works including the refurbishments of a Chinese-constructed Ministry of Justice building, a police headquarters and a sports arena, which Denghua Zhang, a research fellow at ANU's College of Asia and the Pacific, said were similar to China's projects around the region. All three were built with Chinese loans between 2004 and 2009, but fell into disrepair and were built with materials ""inappropriate for the Cook Islands tropical environment"", according to the Lowy Institute. China has agreed to fund the repairs.There's also the China-New Zealand-Cook Islands water supply project (Te Mato Vai) to upgrade the supply network on the main island of Rarotonga that launched in 2014.As Dr Zhang wrote in a 2015 paper, the project — led by a Chinese company and estimated to cost about $NZ60 million ($54 million)— was to be partly funded by a grant from New Zealand and a concessional loan from China.The ""triangular"" aid project also meant New Zealand could learn about China's aid delivery and ensure the concessional loan from China was well managed, the paper said.But after the completion of stage one in 2017, a leak was detected and an independent review found that 17 kilometres of pipeline needed replacing. Stage two of the project is being completed by construction company McConnell Dowell, a subsidiary of a company called Aveng which has its headquarters in South Africa. Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is one of two countries in the North Pacific to recognise China, with Palau, Nauru and Marshall Islands still diplomatically tied to Taiwan.It was David Panuelo, President of FSM, who wrote to other Pacific leaders warning that China's proposed deal was ""a smokescreen for a larger agenda"".""Despite our ceaseless and accurate howls that climate change represents the single most existential security threat to our islands, the Common Development Vision threatens to bring a new Cold War era at best, and a world war at worst,"" he wrote.FSM is in a compact of free association with the US. That gives the US control over airspace and waters in exchange for the US providing funding, defence and access to US social services for Micronesians.At the same time, FSM has been a beneficiary of Chinese money, with more than $US100 million funnelled into the country over 30 years.The Lowy Pacific Aid Map shows China has committed $US5 million per year from 2017 to 2025, as well as a $US2 million cash grant to the country's trust fund.Dr Zhang has noted that FSM has a policy of not taking loans, helping it to avoid debt risk.China has also funded roads, bridges and a state government complex in the country. ""What we do in the island country is to build roads and bridges, not to increase military presence,"" Mr Wang told his FSM counterpart last week.","Asia, China, Cook Islands, Defence and National Security, Disaster Relief, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, International Aid and Trade, Kiribati, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Niue, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2022-06-07 18:37:01+00:00

The world will have to be prepared to work globally, together, to make sure that when that … size of an eruption occurs that we're ready and best prepared because it could affect global food supply, network chains, communication systems,"" Dr Handley said.January 15's explosion triggered a tsunami that destroyed large parts of Tonga and blanketed volcanic ash over the kingdom.The Pacific Island nation was isolated from the rest of the world for more than a month when the eruption and tsunami cut the country's only undersea internet cable, leaving people overseas unable to contact family and friends in Tonga. Tsunami waves were observed across the Pacific and reportedly damaged docked boats in New Zealand and caused an oil spill in Peru which was declared an environmental emergency.The World Bank estimated the damage bill from the disaster will cost Tonga more than $125 million — equivalent to approximately 20 per cent of its GDP. About 600 buildings across Tonga were damaged or destroyed by the tsunami — half of those homes — and an estimated 1,525 people were displaced. The tsunami brought the most devastation to the country's tourism sector because it damaged resorts and natural attractions, while the agricultural sector was heavily impacted by volcanic ash.","Earth Sciences, Indonesia, Peru, Science, Tonga, Tsunamis, United States, Volcanic Eruptions, ",2022-05-16 09:49:32+00:00

knowing that you were HIV-positive had a connotation of death, no future and you cannot live a normal life.""Much has changed since then.HIV can be managed through antiretroviral medication that suppresses the amount of HIV in the body and allows people to live long and healthy lives without passing the virus on.Since her diagnosis, Ms Cati has worked tirelessly to improve outcomes for HIV-positive Pacific Islanders, and in 2007 she remarried and went on to have three children.""I've been living with HIV for more than 20 years and I know without treatment I wouldn't have survived this long,"" she said.""It's really important [for HIV-positive people] to hear testimonies of those who have lived with HIV and are celebrating life, treatment and having relationships.""While rates of new infections and AID-related deaths have more than halved because of treatment options, some disturbing trends have emerged.Of the estimated 37.7 million people living with HIV in 2020, 53 per cent were women and girls, according to UNAIDS. Just four years earlier, figures from UN Women showed young women aged between 15 and 24 made up almost 60 per cent of all new infections globally. UNAIDS country director Renata Ram said this was especially concerning for Fijians.""Fiji in particular has seen a 116 per cent increase in new HIV infections since 2010 and almost doubled [the number of infections] in the 15- to 24-year-old age group,"" she said.""Last year during the lockdown period, six babies were born with HIV. This is worrying when other countries with high HIV prevalence have zero mother-to-child transmission.""So if antiretroviral treatment is free and available and infection rates are declining globally, what is driving new infections among women and girls?According to Ms Ram, an uncontrolled sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemic, unsafe sex and under-resourced HIV testing programs are to blame.""In Pacific Island countries we suffer from a high burden of sexually transmitted infections but the prevalence over time is not well known,"" Ms Ram said.""With HIV, you may only detect it when a person becomes very sick or if they get routine testing, which is not really happening now,"" she said.Under previous donor funding arrangements, Ms Ram said a comprehensive HIV and STI control program was implemented regionally but was not continued beyond 2014.As a result, fewer women and girls have been screened for sexually transmitted diseases in recent years, and if they do not get tested, they cannot get treatment.Hilda Wayne talks to the inspirational women on the frontlines of the fight against HIV in the Pacific region.""Donor priorities have shifted to other emerging issues without fully addressing the HIV and AIDS situation in the Pacific,"" she said.""Ten years ago, we had a robust HIV and STI program but now it's unheard of and people think HIV has left this region, but it's not the case.""According to the UN, teenage girls and young women are vulnerable to contracting HIV due to intimate partner violence and a lack of sexual and reproductive health information.Ms Ram said married women were also vulnerable to HIV because of the unequal power dynamic between men and women when it came to negotiating condom use.""Some men do not prefer to wear a condom and women do not have the negotiating power in terms of wearing condoms and protecting themselves from HIV,"" she said.For women and girls to get help, they must be able to talk about what is happening to them.Ms Ram said ending the silence around sexual and reproductive health in the Pacific was key.""Talking about sex is also a very taboo subject in the Pacific due to this conservatism, so our awareness campaigns can be very challenging,"" she said.""We have antiretroviral treatment … and for anyone in the Pacific, this is free of charge once a person enrols into the treatment program.As for Pacific leaders, Ms Ram said the region desperately needed greater and sustained funding from donors to tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic through education and testing.""One of the key things [to implement] is the comprehensive sexuality education package in school curriculums,"" she said.""It is about empowering young people to know about themselves, their sexuality, how to treat people and about diseases.""""There is this perception that HIV is a death sentence, but it is not.

Thank you, Jesus,"" she said.The young girl was so distressed by the experience that she stopped talking for several days.""At that age, you couldn't imagine the feeling, [the thoughts] and the experience they had,"" she said.While everyone suffers during natural disasters, women and girls experience unique risks.According to the UN, about 70 per cent of women and girls have experienced sexual or gender-based violence during crises.But despite this, women and girls are proving to be capable leaders, promoting women's needs in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.Ms Kupu, a journalist with more than a decade's experience in the region, was enjoying a quiet Saturday afternoon like many Tongans when loud bangs rang out across the South Pacific nation.Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai erupted in the early hours of the evening, sending shockwaves around the world — the sounds so loud they were heard in Fiji, Vanuatu, Alaska and Canada.The 1-in-1,000-year volcanic eruption propelled ash and rock into skies above Tonga's largest island, Tongatapu, before a tsunami inundated low-lying areas.""The clouds, the noise, the ash was coming and there was a distinctive smell,"" she said.""I knew it was the volcano erupting, but we didn't know what was going to happen.""Tongan writer and consultant Sia Uhila Angilau sensed the scale of the eruption — the mounting pressure in her ears felt as if they were ""going to burst""""It shook the whole house, and I was afraid that the glass was going to crack,"" she said.Ms Angilau said panicked locals spilled out onto the street, causing congestion and chaos.""People were crying and running and calling out.""I was in a car and I wished I was in a truck so I could take all the people on the road,"" she said.""Most people didn't know where they were running to, they were just going away from the ocean.""Five people died, including two swimmers in Peru, and up to 600 buildings were damaged or destroyed by the tsunami, which wiped out some islands completely.Ms Angilau said the events of January 15 were still raw for many people.""The fear, the panic and everything, I think we're still reliving that reality now,"" she said.""We've had thunder lately and many of us were scared, we just sat there and cried wondering if there was another eruption.""A full recovery is expected to take years. For women and girls, ongoing disruptions to family units, health systems and housing can be particularly distressing, and lead to violence.Ofa Guttenbeil-Likiliki is the director of the Women and Children Crisis Centre (WCCC) in Tonga.In the first 72 hours after the eruption and tsunami, the WCCC carried out needs assessments and worked to ensure women and children had shelter, food and water and emotional support.""So, making sure they were in places with good lighting, access to bathrooms, and they weren't in positions of being abused or violated because of their vulnerabilities,"" she said.""Then we rolled out psychosocial support to these affected areas, and in particular, the women who were displaced from outer islands.Many women were already escaping violence which worsened during recent COVID-19 lockdowns.The WCCC handles between 20 and 30 domestic and family violence cases each month, but after Tonga's 26-day lockdown in early February, Ms Guttenbeil-Likiliki said that rose by an additional 55 cases.""We were prepared for this violence to going to keep climbing. The deputy police commissioner said whilst other crimes have decreased in Tonga, domestic violence is on the rise,"" she said.While women bear the brunt of trauma during disasters, they are leaders in recovery and resilience.Sharon Bhagwan-Rolls is the Regional Manager of Shifting the Power Coalition, which draws upon the skills, cultural knowledge and lived experiences of Pacific Island women to respond to disasters.""We're progressing gender equality, disability and LGBT inclusion agenda, because as local women leaders, we are on the front lines, and we've been experiencing it,"" she said.Ms Bhagwan-Rolls said it was often the case that the humanitarian response to natural disasters in the Pacific was led by people outside the region and failed to meet the needs of diverse groups.""When you talk about building back better, you do need to ask: what wasn't working for women —  for women with disabilities, the LGBT community, for young women — previously?""In the days and weeks after Tonga Hunga-Tonga Ha'apai erupted, Ms Angilau said women did ""everything they could"" to help their communities get back on their feet.""A lady was telling me how she couldn't go to work during the lockdowns, so she went and collected coconuts, and sold them by the roadside just to make money,"" she said.""I'm aware of another woman who went and took out a loan so her boat could be used by the divers to go fishing, just to earn money and have food available for us after the eruption.""That's something wonderful.""","Disaster Relief, Disasters and Accidents, Domestic Violence, Foreign Aid, Gender Roles, Tonga, Volcanic Eruptions, Women, Women's Health, ",2022-04-16 20:10:00+00:00

But if you're married and have a family or you have a spouse, then you are entitled,"" she said.""That even flows to some of the health workers, who might think if a young girl comes in and is not married, then they are not entitled to contraception.""In some countries, Dr Duro-Aina said, a ""culture of silence"" and a fear of retribution from partners also drove women away from using contraceptives.""It's like sexual health is something we in the Pacific shouldn't be talking about freely,"" she said.""Women have had to do it privately because they didn't want their husbands to know.""In the case the spouse has known, it's led to some degree of domestic or gender-based violence against them and the health worker who gave the service.""On top of that, Dr Duro-Aina said women also had to deal with misinformation that was circulated about contraceptives, like claims they cause cancer.Contraceptives are ""critical"" to empowering Pacific Island women and improving their status in the region, Dr Duro-Aina said. ""The fact is that when women are able to use contraceptives, then they are better empowered,"" she said.""Girls can stay in school and get an education. They can get jobs and then provide for their families.""And then we're able to lift the levels of our women globally, and especially in the Pacific.""The UNFPA provides contraceptives to 14 Pacific Island countries, administered through public health facilities.Dr Duro-Aina said various short and long-acting methods were available to women, including:""Contraception is like a basket of fruits, you're able to choose what one suits you best,"" she said.Someone who has witnessed the impacts firsthand, working alongside women as an obstetrics and gynaecology specialist, is Dr Freda Wemin.Dr Wemin is based in Goroka, Papua New Guinea, which has a low rate of contraceptive use.Only 37 per cent of married women and 18 per cent of sexually active single women use a form of contraception.And this has had dire consequences for young women and girls.""They fall pregnant, and they end up doing unsafe abortions,"" she said.""We have lost women dying of sepsis doing abortions themselves and not coming and getting help on time because of the stigma attached to it.""Last year we had three who died from doing terminations.""Dr Wemin said more than 50 per cent of women who died in hospitals in Papua New Guinea had cervical cancer. The second biggest killer of women was sepsis.""It is usually the ones who deliver in the village, or they do abortions and they become very sick,"" she said.Papua New Guinea has the highest rates of maternal death in the Pacific.More than 2,000 women die in childbirth each year and women, on average, have four babies.Dr Wemin said more work needed to be done to educate women about the costs associated with having more children.""A lot of women would like to equalise the gender of the children, so it is balanced, so if they have one or the other, they keep having babies to get the balance,"" she said.""We educate on the economic benefits of having a good number of children, then people will make informed choices about the size of their family.""We're very proactive in providing services, but it depends on the individuals.""Even in town where they have access to it in a five- or 10-minute walk to the facility, they don't come because they're engaged with daily living.""Ms Wemin said upskilling community healthcare workers who worked with ""the bulk of the population"" in Goroka would help address the knowledge gap around contraceptives and family planning.""The program covers obstetrics emergencies, family planning and all the things that they need to do to address and refer patients [to hospital],"" she said.""That's an ongoing program and we will continue to do that this year and next year to address the high rate of maternal death and perinatal death.""Women are coming on a timely basis with complications, so we're able to assist them.

Hilda Wayne finds out. She said the fundamental problems with Western notions of beauty was that they only valued a woman's physical characteristics, and ""othered"" Pacific Island women.""If [a woman's] physical appearance appeals to the majority, then it's considered the closest illustration of beauty,"" she said.Ms Latu drew upon the concept of Orientalism by Edward Said, which created an image of Eastern cultures as uncivilised, compared to the West. ""It looks at understanding the West as the hegemony. And then anything outside that is the other,"" she said.""The term 'exotic' was used to describe the tropical settings like our Pacific Islands, so images of Pasifika women became a manifestation of pleasure for the white male gaze.""There was a strong suggestion that Pacific women were seen as both sensual and savage, which is considered 'other' to the West.""Ms Latu said Pasifika women historically were seen as ""exotic"" and ""different"", which led to a ""double marginalisation"" in daily life. ""There were such depictions where women were photographed partly naked in the forest with flowers in the hair,"" she said.""This depiction of beauty was not only introduced to the Western ideology of beauty, but also captured the double marginalisation of Pasifika women.One participant in Ms Latu's research paper confessed she still received comments from people about her ""exotic"" appearance.""She was a Fijian with European and other nationalities. She talked about how she's often labelled as being 'exotic-looking' – a reference that she understood to hold significant value to the Eurocentric ideology of Western beauty,"" she said.When it came to fitting in, Ms Latu said all participants in her study agreed on one point.""If they could look like the ultimate standard of beauty, then, to them, they would be rewarded by the social capital of acceptance.""Ni-Vanuatu woman Ruth Kaltonga grew up surrounded by Western notions of beauty —""white women with soft long hair"" — in magazines or on television.As a young girl, it affected her.""All these types of women were being defined as beautiful, that this is what beauty is like and then you see that none of them look like you,"" she said.""It does create some sort of doubt.""When travelling to Vanuatu's outer islands, Ms Kaltonga said women seemed relatively unfazed by the beauty standards being peddled online — a phenomenon she wished she saw in the city.""When you go to really rural areas, these things don't matter to them. But, in the capital, the beauty standard has really taken its toll and [is] causing a lot of issues with identity and self-worth,"" she said.""It's not about what you look like or how long your hair is. It's about what you can do for your family, how you care for your family and how you contribute.""Ms Kaltonga said having strong, grounded female role models helped overcome critical thoughts. ""I was very fortunate. The women in my family and the members of my family really taught us that it's what's inside that counts.""Ms Latu agreed, and said Pacific Island families played an important role in uplifting women and building a healthy self-esteem — a theme she explored in her research.""Just having words of encouragement from mothers can really make you feel better,"" she said.""It starts from home. When you have a supportive family and community, it really does make life a lot easier, especially when we're bombarded with what we're seeing online.""Fotuosamoa Jody Jackson is a Samoan storyteller and educator, who now calls New Zealand home.Speaking from a personal perspective, Fotuosamoa said beauty in a Pacific Island context was about service to others and knowing where you come from.After the death of her father early on in her life, Fotuosamoa and her seven siblings were raised by a strong, single mother who disregarded aesthetic beauty.""It's the person, who you are, and your identity before anything to do with your physical attributes"" she said.""But there were things that define beauty in my culture, which is when you know who you are, when you speak your language, when you know what to do in a in a cultural setting.""No one teaches you anything. You just have to look and listen and learn. And when you achieve all those things, there is the belief that that is beautiful.""Despite the criticism, Fotuosamoa said she felt encouraged by young women who embraced their individuality online, rather than being swayed by Western trends.This was particularly the case with her 14-year-old daughter.""What I have loved about social media is that it's really allowed the younger crowd to make decisions for themselves,"" she said.""They are much better people than us because they are learning through social media and they are making decisions, especially on Instagram.""Fotuosamoa said introducing some control over her daughter's account and having regular conversations about content she read was a positive experience overall.""I have to continually demonstrate to my children that being Pasifika and being Samoan is a beautiful thing.

Now it has reached 6 million.Despite the enormity of the figure, the world undoubtedly hit its 6 millionth death some time ago. Poor record-keeping and testing in many parts of the world has led to an under-count in coronavirus deaths, in addition to excess deaths related to the pandemic but not from actual COVID-19 infections, like people who died from preventable causes but could not receive treatment because hospitals were full.Edouard Mathieu, head of data for the Our World in Data portal, said that, when countries' excess mortality figures are studied, as many as nearly four times the reported death toll have likely died because of the pandemic.""Confirmed deaths represent a fraction of the true number of deaths due to COVID, mostly because of limited testing, and challenges in the attribution of the cause of death,"" Mr Mathieu said.""In some, mostly rich, countries that fraction is high and the official tally can be considered to be fairly accurate, but in others it is highly underestimated.""The world has seen more than 445 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, and new weekly cases have been declining recently in all regions except for the Western Pacific, which includes China, Japan and South Korea, among others, the World Health Organization reported this week.Global vaccine disparity continues, with only 6.95 per cent of people in low-income countries fully vaccinated, compared to more than 73 per cent in high-income nations, according to Our World in Data.ABC/ AP","Australia, COVID-19, Death and Dying, Hong Kong, Tonga, ",2022-03-07 23:38:23+00:00

addiction to methamphetamine and cocaine is driving the problem, a Lowy Institute report has found.The use of illicit drugs has been steadily increasing in Australia and New Zealand, even as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains, according to the report released on Thursday.Australia's illegal drug trade is estimated to be worth $11.3 billion per year.The maritime corridor that is used for legitimate trade between Australian, Asian and American markets is also a key transit hub for organised crime syndicates and drug cartels, in what is called the Pacific ""drug highway"", according to the report.This ""highway"", it said, was servicing a growing demand for illicit drugs in the Pacific Islands.""In the past decade, the local [Pacific] drug market has grown, with facilitators being paid in drugs for services, then selling them onwards,"" the report said.""This has contributed to rising addiction amongst locals and the emergence of a local drug network.""In some cases, Indigenous and local groups were working with international cartels to develop home-grown production facilities.""External organised crime actors have played a central role in establishing, fuelling and maintaining the drug market in the Pacific and driving the growth of local drug production and consumption,"" the report said. ""Australia and New Zealand's prolific and high-profile organised crime networks — including outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMCGs) — have expanded their activities offshore and into the Pacific.""There has been a notable increase in OMCG members travelling to the Pacific since 2016, most commonly to the Cook Islands and Fiji."" Tonga — which was previously a transit point for drugs being trafficked to Australia and New Zealand — was seeing a particularly dramatic rise in the use of illegal drugs and associated issues, the report noted.""Officials reported that the increase in drug offences indicated the growing presence of methamphetamine in the kingdom and [that] correlated with an increase in drug-related crime such as robberies and house break-ins,"" the report said.Fiji has also seen drug-related policing cases increase substantially, from 148 in 2008 to 1,400 in 2018, the report noted.In Papua New Guinea, there are no laws that prohibit the production, sale or use of methamphetamines, making it a key location to transit drugs to Australia.The report's author, Jose Sousa-Santos, said the street value for methamphetamine and cocaine in Australia and New Zealand was among the highest in the world.He said this was because Australia and New Zealand were small, geographically isolated markets, which pushed up the price.""These markets, for being so lucrative, become of interest to transnational criminal organisations, trafficking drugs to the Pacific,"" he said.""They require facilitators in the Pacific to assist in their operations and in moving the drugs through the region, and the way that this is done is by having these criminal syndicates be supported by a local drug market.""Transnational drug crime is a protracted problem, but not one that is of the Pacific's own making — rather the region is a casualty of the criminal greed of organised crime and the drug appetite of Australia and New Zealand.""The report also found that cross-border efforts to police drug trafficking had been undermined by a disconnect between regional and national law enforcement, and disparity in capacity across agencies, which had eroded trust and intelligence-sharing between them.""In a region plagued by 'unmet development challenges', transnational crime and illicit drugs are a cross-cutting threat to development, security and governance in the Pacific,"" the report said.Meanwhile, ""narco-corruption"" in the Pacific ""compromised institutions and individuals across key agencies, such as customs, police and immigration, and undermined the rule of law"".The report also found that the deportation policies of Australia, New Zealand and the United States were ""exacerbating crime and addiction within Pacific nations"" by returning convicted criminals back to their country of origin without rehabilitation.""Many times, these deportees have spent most of their lives outside of their countries of origin and have grown up in Australia, New Zealand or the US,"" Mr Sousa-Santos said. ""When they are returned, they're returned with no cultural understanding, language skills of those countries … support networks to receive them or prospects of work. ""So, many of them tend to reach back to their criminal contacts in Australia, New Zealand and the US and create a supposed shadow economy and power structures in which they can fit in.""New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in 2019 told Australia not to ""deport your problems"", saying the Australian government had to stop sending convicted criminals who had spent most of their lives in Australia back to New Zealand.Mr Sousa-Santos said this could be addressed by providing holistic support to integrate individuals being deported, including ""drug rehabilitation, some type of vocational training, language and cultural training before going back"". He said it was important ""that we support initiatives back into the country to which they are being deported to ensure that they are able to integrate back into society"".Footing the bill for these kinds of initiatives, he said, would save the economies where the drugs were headed ""tenfold"" in the long run.The ABC has reached out to Australian Border Force for comment.Australia and New Zealand, in collaboration with their Pacific partners, had increased initiatives to combat drug production and transnational crimes but, the report warned, a ""one-size fits all"" approach would not work for the region.""The response by Pacific states and traditional partners must be rapid, proactive and adaptive,"" the report noted.A spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said that, while the market for drugs in Australia was strong, the ability of law enforcement agencies to work together against organised crime had never been stronger.""Stopping crime at the source is a key strategy for the AFP and partnerships with Pacific policing organisations are resulting in a more-hostile environment for criminal activity,"" an AFP spokesperson said.""The Pacific Transnational Crime Network (PTCN) is an AFP-supported and Pacific-led transnational criminal intelligence network for Pacific law enforcement agencies, whose aim is to increase the capacity for Pacific Island law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate and disrupt transnational crime in the region.""The offshore disruption of criminal groups and infiltrating

Tomorrow (Friday) night, in fact.Secondly, it's now called Super Rugby Pacific.It's been born out of last year's trans-Tasman series and a long-held desire among rugby fans on both sides of the Tasman to have a competition based around our own teams, playing in our cities and time zones.But also, with a long-overdue injection of Pacific island flair. More on this in a moment.In truth, this new competition is the next iteration of formats derived over the previous COVID-19-impacted 18 months, and most crucially, the departure of South African-based teams to the northern hemisphere.Now, while it's certainly true that joining northern hemisphere competitions has been an oft-threatened but unplayed card held by the South African Rugby Union, the break-up of Super Rugby as we knew it in March 2020 finally forced their hand.That, and New Zealand rugby (NZR) declared that the break-up of Super Rugby as we knew it was the time to turn our attention on ourselves. Rugby Australia (RA) didn't need a lot of convincing.With international borders closed, locally-based competitions were quickly developed out of necessity – for contractually required content and the income thereof, specifically.But the intention from NZR and RA was always that they'd come together under one banner. They couldn't quite make it happen properly in 2021; the six-week trans-Tasman series was tacked onto the end of the respective domestic competitions and wasn't confirmed until the week of – but it's been all systems go ever since.The result is what awaits rugby fans this weekend – the new era of Super Rugby Pacific.Along with the five Australian sides and the five New Zealand sides, are two teams new to this level, but who will both bring a whole new level of passion, and flair, and pure rugby entertainment.The Fijian Drua you might have heard of; the team played the last three seasons of Australia's domestic National Rugby Championship (NRC), winning the title in 2018.Around half of the 2022 Drua squad gained experience during the NRC years while also playing locally in Fiji, but Super Rugby is another step that they're very excited to take.The Fijian Rugby Union (FRU) jumped at the chance to get a Fijian-based side into Super Rugby, and see the move as a major development pathway for local players.All of a sudden, professional rugby has come to the islands; players don't have to relocate to Australia or New Zealand, or to Europe to follow their rugby dream.The FRU hope the Drua can do exactly the same for their national side as the Jaguares were already doing in Super Rugby for Argentina, and what Japanese national coach Jamie Joseph was setting the Sunwolves up to do.The other new team is Moana Pasifika, a team based in South Auckland, but geared mainly to create opportunities for Tongan and Samoan eligible players and slowly build local depth for those nations as well.While the Drua have the advantage of being something of an existing program, albeit one on hold, Moana Pasifika are the classic clean-slate new team coming into a new competition. New players, new coaches, new administration, new identity; the lot.On the playing front, they've added some important experience in former Wallabies Christian Lealiifano and their inaugural captain Sekope Kepu, and while they've added a few other players with Super Rugby experience, the majority of the squad are fringe players from NZ's National Provincial Championship.And the expectations around them are appropriate. This is a team that will take time to be competitive, and so success in 2022 may not be measured in wins.Complicating the opening weeks of Super Rugby Pacific though, and quite likely lingering through the season, remains the threat of COVID-19 infiltrating teams.As the cases mount in New Zealand, NZR made the move to get all six teams into a training and playing bubble in the ski resort town of Queenstown on the South Island last week, with some games to be played in Dunedin, too.It wasn't quite quick enough, however, to stop a number of tests returning positive in the Moana Pasifika squad, forcing the postponement of what was to have been the season-opening game against Auckland neighbours and reigning Super Rugby trans-Tasman Champions, the Blues.There's a degree of inevitability in the air that more teams will be affected, and more games postponed. But the Australian teams hope they're through the worst of it, with the five sides all hit by outbreaks during the off-season.The Queensland Reds are coming off the back end of a small outbreak that took down a number of players including James O'Connor and Jordan Petaia, as well as coach Brad Thorn.In terms of favouritism, the Reds and Brumbies will lead the way of the Australia teams again, as will the Crusaders and Blues of the Kiwis.But it's going to be the greatly improving sides that will keep everyone on their toes — the NSW Waratahs won't have another winless season as they did in 2021, and the Hurricanes are certainly expected to be a much better team as well.It will all come to a head from Friday night, where we'll find out which teams can hit the ground running, to start the new era of Super Rugby Pacific.Super Rugby Pacific fixture — Round 1 (all times AEDT)FRIDAYBlues v Moana Pacifika, Dunedin (POSTPONED)NSW Waratahs v Fijian Drua, Sydney 1945SATURDAYChiefs v Highlanders, Queenstown 1435Crusaders v Hurricanes, Dunedin 1705Queensland Reds v Melbourne Rebels, Brisbane 1945SUNDAYBrumbies v Western Force, Canberra 1400","Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Pacific, Rugby Union, Samoa, Sport, Super Rugby, Tonga, ",2022-02-17 00:48:05+00:00

We are lucky we've had two years to get our vax rate pretty high, and we had a pretty immediate lockdown.""Tonga is only one of several Pacific island countries to experience their first outbreaks over the past month.All have limited health care resources, and there is concern that the remoteness that once protected them may now make helping them difficult.""Clearly when you've got countries that have already got a very stretched, and fragile health system, when you have an emergency or a disaster and then you have the potential introduction of the virus, that's going to make an already serious situation immeasurably worse,"" said John Fleming, the Asia-Pacific head of health for the Red Cross.Tonga was coated with ash following the January 15 eruption of the massive undersea Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano, then hit with a tsunami that followed.The aftermath saw three people confirmed killed and several small settlements in outlying islands wiped off the map, while the volcanic ash has tainted much of the drinking water on the island.The nation of 105,000 had reported only one case of COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic — a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints missionary returning to the island from Africa via New Zealand who tested positive in October — and authorities debated whether to let international aid in.They decided they had to, but despite strict precautions unloading ships and planes from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Britain and China, two Tongan men who worked at the capital's Queen Salote Wharf handling shipments tested positive on Tuesday.""Tonga is just out of luck this year,"" said Samieula Fonua, the chairman of Tonga Cable Ltd., the state-own company that owns the sole fibre-optic cable connecting the nation to the rest of the world.""We desperately need some good news.""The two were moved into isolation, but in tests of 36 possible contacts, one's wife and two children also tested positive, while the others tested negative, the local Matangi Tonga news site reported.It was not clear how many people they might have come into contact with the dock workers, but the government released a list of locations where the virus might have spread, including a church on two days, several shops, a bank on two days and a kindergarten during school hours.Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni told reporters ""some"" of the five infected had started to show symptoms and were being quarantined at a medical facility.He imposed an open-ended lockdown starting 6pm on Wednesday; one that could be particular arduous for Tongans because most have been without any internet connections since the volcanic eruption severed the fibre-optic cable to the country.The government has been primarily communicating with residents by radio addresses, and Mr Fonua said his crews estimate they may have to replace an 87-kilometer section of undersea cable.Still, they were hopeful to restore service by next week.It is not yet known what variant of the virus has reached Tonga, nor who brought it in.Officials have stressed that the aid deliveries were tightly controlled, and that it is not yet proven the virus came in that way.Sailors aboard the Australian aid ship HMAS Adelaide reported nearly two dozen infections after an outbreak on board, but authorities said it had been unloaded at a different wharf.Crew members aboard aid flights from Japan and Australia also reported infections.One of the dock workers who initially tested positive has now tested negative, but remains in quarantine, and 389 other port workers have all tested negative, Mr Sovaleni told reporters in Tonga.But he said Friday that a ""primary contact"" to one of the people infected had tested positive, and ordered the lockdown extended another 48 hours.""The people are OK with the lockdown because they understand the reason why, so the corona doesn't spread over our little country,"" said resident Tulutulu Kalaniuvalu, a 53-year-old former police official who now in private business.""But people hope it doesn't last long because most of the people depend on the crops that we grow at our plantations and people need to go there.""Despite the optimism, experience from elsewhere in the pandemic, especially with prevalence now of the rapid-spreading Omicron variant, suggests that Tonga faces an uphill battle in trying to contain the outbreak, according to Indonesian epidemiologist Dicky Budiman.Some 61 per cent of Tongans are fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data, but because the country has not yet seen any infections, there will be no natural immunity and it is not clear whether the shots were given long enough ago that they may now be less effective, Mr Budiman said.The global experience has been that when the virus hits such countries, the number of hospitalisations is very high, he said, recommending that the government immediately start offering booster shots and open vaccinations to younger children.""If we race with this virus we will not win,"" he said.""So we have to move forward by protecting the most vulnerable.""The October case of the missionary with COVID-19 prompted a wave of vaccinations, and 1,000 people already showed up for a first dose after the current outbreak was detected, Mr Kalaniuvalu said.This is already starting to be seen in the Solomon Islands, which reported its first community outbreak on January 19.With only 11 per cent of its population fully vaccinated, the virus has been spreading rapidly with the Red Cross reporting that less than two weeks later, there are now more than 780 recorded cases and five COVID-19 related deaths.Elsewhere, Fiji — still reeling from damage caused by Cyclone Cody in early January — has been battling an ongoing spike in cases, fuelled by Omicron, and cases have been reported for the first time in Kiribati, Samoa and Palau.Palau has nearly its entire population fully vaccinated, while Fiji has 68 per cent and Samoa 62 per cent, but Kiribati is only at 33 per cent.The key to ensuring hospitals aren't overwhelmed is to make sure more people get shots, Mr Budiman said.""These countries that choose to have this COVID-free strategy, they are very vulnerable,"" he said.Mr Kalaniuvalu said some people have questioned the decision to let the ships carrying aid into Tonga, but most feel it was necessary to help through the aftermath of the volcano and tsunami, and that the islanders now just had to do their best to minimise the impact of the outbreak.""To be honest with you, we were one of the luckiest countries in the world for almost three years, now it's finally here in Tonga,"" he said.""We, the people of Tonga, knew sooner or later the coronavirus would come to Tonga because the corona is here to stay.""AP","COVID-19, Disasters and Accidents, Foreign Aid, Pacific, Tonga, ",2022-02-04 11:22:00+00:00

106,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-22/satellite-data-images-reveal-power-of-tonga-volcano-eruption/100773458,"At 3pm AEDT on January 15, Japan's meteorological satellite Himawari-8 was scanning what would have been an otherwise innocuous day over the western Pacific.Moments later, the Hunga Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai volcano erupted with such force that even seasoned volcanologists were left stunned.The blast was so powerful that it caused a sonic boom that could be heard across multiple countries, triggered a tsunami and spewed a column of ash more than 30 kilometres up into the air.The blast force, equivalent to 5-6 megatons of TNT, set off a visible shock wave that rippled through the atmosphere and reached the other side of the planet.""It's pretty shocking. To be honest, I've never seen anything that looked like that,"" said satellite data scientist Simon Proud. ""It was clear just from the initial images that it was much bigger than anything we've seen in recent years and probably in the satellite era.""As the ash settled over the Pacific region in the days following the eruption, aerial surveys and satellite imagery began to reveal the volcano's catastrophic impact.Houses on neighbouring Tongan islands were wiped out, other islands were blanketed in acidic ash and left flooded from a tsunami triggered by the powerful eruption.While the remote archipelago sustained enormous damage, to date, the death toll stands at three.As disaster response teams work to deliver aid, scientists are also scrambling to piece together the unprecedented cascade of events that led to and followed such an enormous eruption.The Hunga Tonga-Hunga-Ha'apai volcano is about 60 kilometres north of Tonga's main island.It sits along what volcanologist Janine Krippner described as a volcano-making factory: a subduction zone in the Earth's crust where the Pacific tectonic plate is slowly driving underneath the Australian plate.""The subduction zone is really the reason we have this active area and that's why we have the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, which is this zone of tectonic boundaries that are just better for making volcanoes,"" said Dr Krippner from the Global Volcanism Program.""So that's the case here. There are a lot of active volcanoes in the area, and a lot of them are submarine.""Up until recently, all that was visible of this volcano were two small, adjacent islands called Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha'apai, that sat just over 100 metres above sea level.But after an eruption in 2015, ash and rock deposits left over from the volcanic activity joined the two islands.What remained was a new and uncharted island in the middle of the Pacific.But this is just a tiny fraction of what is an enormous underwater volcano.Using adjusted seafloor elevation data, the true scale of the volcano is revealed.The volcano is almost 2 kilometres high and more than 20 kilometres across and features what's known as a caldera at the top.The caldera is a depression in the rim that's left behind after an eruption expels enough magma that the ground collapses in on itself. It's a telltale sign that this volcano is capable of big explosive eruptions.The fact that the vast majority of the volcano is submerged is also crucial in understanding why the blast was so powerful.And while scientists may not yet know exactly what occurred, they do know the blast was the result of what's known as a phreatomagmatic eruption, where hot magma comes into contact with relatively cooler water to create immense amounts of steam.""This volume increase is just enormous and that's releasing this huge amount of energy and that's fragmenting the magma even more, breaking it down. And that's what volcanic ash is, the magma blowing itself apart,"" Dr Krippner said.""But now we have this external factor as well, of this explosive steam too. So that gives so much more power, so much more energy to the explosive eruption.""It's believed the eruption occurred around 150 metres below the surface of the water. If these chemical reactions took place in deeper water, the water pressure would likely have helped to contain the explosion.But Dr Krippner said the reaction with the water did not by itself explain the immense power of this eruption and more work needed to be done to figure out the chain of events leading up to the blast.One theory suggested a large landslide may have removed the top of the volcano allowing a vast flood of seawater to interact with the magma.Some clues may lie in satellite images captured of the volcano in the weeks leading up to the event on January 15.Smaller eruptive activity at the end of December changed the location of the cone-shaped vent. Another image captured in early January shows steam pouring out of the vent.And just hours before the eruption, satellites captured imagery showing much of the island had collapsed back beneath the surface of the water.But pinpointing the exact cause may be tricky, as volcanic monitoring equipment that usually allows scientists to understand what's going on deep inside the volcano was not readily available.Simon Proud is a scientist specialising in the analysis of satellite data with the UK's National Centre for Earth Observation.He spends his days poring through images and data captured by satellites, including the Himawari-8, to track storms and monitor atmospheric conditions.Dr Proud said he'd never seen anything like this eruption in his time. The ash cloud went so high, so quickly that the usual methods for measuring the altitude of clouds didn't work.It's estimated that the cloud shot up in a column somewhere between 35 to 40 kilometres in the sky, meaning it penetrated well beyond the layer of the atmosphere known as the tropopause. This layer acts as a ceiling for most of the Earth's weather.Less than an hour after the eruption the enormous mushroom cloud of ash had spread to an area of more than 400km by 400km.But what also caught the eye of many researchers, was the visible shock wave that was sent rippling through the Earth's atmosphere.Dr Proud said, while investigations were ongoing into exactly what took place, it appeared the sheer power of the blast was enough to make the atmosphere move up and down, compressing the air as it travelled around the world.""[The atmosphere moved] by about 100 or 200 metres, and when it does that, it gets a bit warmer and it gets a bit cooler. And that's what we can see in the satellite data,"" he said.""So you know, if you have a loud noise that goes off near your head, you can feel the pressure. And this is kind of similar to that just on a much larger scale.""While volcanoes and weather events in the past have caused these types of shock waves in the atmosphere, the power of this one has stunned scientists.Satellites on the other side of the world detected the shock wave as it rippled through the atmosphere.  Data from the Bureau of Meteorology showed the shock wave was travelling at more than 1000km/h.Tools monitoring atmospheric pressure have since detected the shock wave looping around the Earth at least three times.""I was pretty shocked to see that I didn't think it would last long enough to get all the way around. But, and especially that it's still so obvious on the opposite side of the planet,"" Dr Proud said.While many aspects of the eruption and its impact on the Earth remain puzzling, what's clear is that scientists will be poring over the data from this event for many months to come.Credits:Reporting, mapping, 3D modelling: Mark DomanDesign: Alex PalmerDevelopment: Katia ShatobaNotes about the data used in this story:This story features imagery from the Himawari-8 satellite courtesy of the Japan Meteorological Agency, Sentinel 2 courtesy of the European Union as well as commercial satellite operators Planet Labs PBC and Maxar Technologies.Sea floor bathymetry was sourced from the US-based National Centers for Environmental Information.

also reports of fuel shortages, he added.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said cash donations to Tonga for immediate humanitarian supplies would need to be followed with more substantial support for rebuilding. Australia has so far donated $1 million.""The impact of this volcanic eruption and the subsequent tsunami and the damage the inundation is causing will be an ongoing challenge for Tonga, particularly in relation to infrastructure,"" she said, adding that New Zealand and Fiji were also working closely with Tonga.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the Red Cross Society of China had donated $US100,000 ($139,000) to Tonga and delivered ""some emergency supplies including drinking water and food"" on Wednesday.""Going forward, China will continue to provide assistance in cash and supplies based on the situation and Tonga’s needs and strive to overcome unfavourable meteorological conditions such as the volcanic ash to deliver the supplies as soon as possible,"" Mr Zhao said.  Other nations have made substantial donations including New Zealand and Japan, which offered more than $1 million.Telephone links between Tonga and the outside world were reconnected late on Wednesday, although restoring full internet services is likely to take weeks.Tonga Rugby Union chief executive Peter Harding, who has been stranded in Australia during the pandemic, managed to contact his wife to learn about the ordeal she and her son had experienced when the volcano erupted.""My wife was at the beach when the explosion went off, so she obviously raced and got into the car and got the dogs in the car and got home as quick as possible,"" he told ABC Pacific Beat.""She did say that the water coming down the street was probably about a metre or a metre and a half high.""Our son was in the car and he was pretty terrified, as you could probably imagine.""He was showing me what was going on in the sky … it was apocalyptic, to be honest with you.""Since then, Mr Harding said he had been trying to reach his wife again but without success, and he is critical of the cost of calling from Australia.Despite the internet connection issues, Tongans have still managed to access social media to post images of the destruction by the tsunami and give accounts of their shock after the massive explosion.ABC/Reuters","Australia, Disaster Relief, Disasters

109,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-21/how-has-the-tonga-volcano-affected-the-weather-/100532346,"How do volcanoes affect the weather and what's going on with the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha'apai eruption?  Close to an eruption there is a huge impact as the volcano releases moisture, ash, and gases into the atmosphere. Within the volcanic plume, electrical charges can build to trigger lightning and the aerosols can seed rain.Volcanoes can even produce ""mud rain"" if the conditions are right.When that rain hits the surface it can then do more damage in the form of a lahar, where volcanic ash flows in a deadly mudslide. Then there is a phenomena known as ""vog,"" volcanic fog, when harmful gases linger near the surface.But it is when the plume gets further up into the atmosphere that it can start having global effects. According to Blair Trewin, senior research scientist at the Bureau of Meteorology, the major global-scale effect of volcanoes is that the bigger eruptions can temporarily cool the atmosphere by releasing sulphur dioxide.It blocks the incoming light from the sun and acts as a kind of global shade.But to hang around and have long term affects, the sulphur dioxide needs to get up above the troposphere. If it remains in the troposphere, where our day-to-day weather takes place, it will be quickly rained back down to the surface.The plume from the Tongan volcano is estimated to have reached approximately 35 kilometres high, well up into the stratosphere.""The other thing is that volcanoes which tend to have the greatest cooling effects on climates are in the tropics,"" he said. Emissions from the tropics have a much better chance of spreading over both hemispheres, rather than being stuck in one. So two ticks. But based on initial estimates, it is not looking like the latest Tongan eruption has released enough sulphur dioxide to cause significant cooling. ""The estimates I've seen so far suggest somewhere around 0.1-0.2 megatonnes [million tonnes] of sulphur dioxide has been emitted,"" Dr Trewin said.The last volcano which did have a global cooling effect, Mount Pinatubo in 1991, released significantly more sulphur dioxide.""Mount Pinatubo emitted about 15 to 20 megatonnes, so somewhere in the order of 100 times more than what the Tongan volcano has."" Mr Trewin said there could be local cooling around the volcano where significant ash is being generated.""But at a global scale, the eruption we've seen so far, we wouldn't expect to have any significant global climatic impacts,"" he said. Dr Trewin does not expect any significant effects on Australian weather form the Tongan volcano. ""Not really, apart from attractive sunsets in some places,"" he said. Andrew Tupper of Natural Hazards Consulting and a former manager of the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre is likewise not predicting weather interruptions in Australia.According to Dr Tupper, the volcanic cloud is now travelling out over the Indian Ocean, having crossed Australia.  But because it has travelled around 35km up, it is not affecting our weather. ""The normal rain that we get, even in the summer, the maximum height of thunderstorms is around 16 or 17 kilometres in the tropics, and usually a bit lower in the mid-latitudes,"" he said. ""So they are just not interacting with that volcanic cloud.""The question remaining is if any more sulphur dioxide could be released in follow-up eruptions. Heather Handley, volcanologist and  adjunct associate professor at Monash University, said it depended on how much of the gas has been lost previously and how much is stored. Her work on samples from the same volcano in 2009 showed the magma that formed rocks at the surface had travelled quickly and retained a lot of its gas. ""So there is potential that if there are larger scale eruptions it could contribute significant sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere,"" Dr Handley said.""But we just don't know at this stage what the next steps for the volcano are.""It's hard to predict whether that's going to continue to erupt, or produce a big eruption, or just decline in activity now.""As mentioned, the last volcano to have a significant impact on the global climate was Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991. According to Dr Trewin it was one of three eruptions in the last century which had a major effect on global climate — the others being El Chichón in Mexico in 1982 and Mount Agung in Bali in 1963. The biggest eruption in recorded human history was Mount Tambora in 1815 in Indonesia. Its cooling effects led to 1816 being know as the year without a summer.According to Dr Handley, it affected different areas of the planet in different ways.""[Researchers] linked that to things like a more successful polar bear breeding season because of the cool air, but then it affected a lot of crops in the northern hemisphere and led to famine,"" she said. ""So there were much wider reaching impacts of these larger scale volcanic eruptions that impact the climate.""""One thing which I think's really cool in this context is that there was a major eruption in 1808 which is known about, both from it's climatic impact — from some of the deposits — and also from things like sunsets,"" Dr Trewin said. But no one knows where the volcano was. Seriously.It is referred to as the ""mystery eruption"".""The most prominent theory is that it was an undersea volcano somewhere in the South Pacific and whatever island it was on was destroyed by the eruption, never to be seen again,"" Dr Trewin said.So climate-changing eruptions have certainly happened before and will certainly happen again.For Dr Tupper, the Tongan eruption acts as a reminder that natural disasters often reach beyond one type of hazard or field of science. ""Over the last two years we've been dealing with COVID and some of the other stuff has has taken a back seat,"" he said.""But an eruption like this just reminds us of all the natural hazards in the region and the importance of monitoring them and building better warning systems.""","ACT, Climate Change, NSW, NT, QLD, Rain, SA, TAS, Tonga, VIC, WA,

""I don't know what people were thinking. ""But we also got things like high heels, [and] we often get things like ball gowns.""Ms McLachlan said there were enough unsolicited donations to fill 33 Olympic-sized swimming pools. ""Often, a lot of these goods actually just unfortunately end up in landfill, because they can't be distributed.""The shipments can also end up costing the country they arrive at, millions in storage fees, according to WFP Pacific initiative Donate Responsibly.Donate Responsibly noted the most urgent need in times of crisis is money, and no other type of donation can match its impact.The organisations said the Australian Council for International Development, and Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission were helpful resources to find trusted charities. Damaris Pfendt, the Pacific Humanitarian Coordinator for aid organisation Caritas Australia, said cash donations also allowed the flexibility to respond to changing needs after a disaster and provided greater dignity, by allowing locals to lead the recovery.""It gives the community, the people, the organisations on the ground, a way to really decide what is needed.""Ms Pfendt said this also allowed the cash to enter the local economy. ""So, if you send cash, then if they buy from local resourced stores and so on, it goes back into their economy, which helps them recover as well.""Ms McLachlan said those goods could be donated to domestic charities, or a community might wish to use them to fund-raise. ""You can have a car boot sale or something like that, and raise some cash and contribute that cash to your chosen humanitarian organisation,"" she said.""It's complex, at the best of times, getting shipping containers and sending them off to other places.""Please leave it to the humanitarian organisations.

was found on Monday.There were reports of some injuries, but Dr Setoya said ""not many"" people had been hurt.Destruction, meanwhile, has been widespread.James Garvin, chief scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said the force of the eruption was estimated to be the equivalent of five to 10 megatons of TNT, or more than 500 times that of the nuclear bomb the United States dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima at the end of World War II.Every home on Mango Island, where about 50 people live, has been destroyed, and only two houses remain on Fonoifua. Nomuka Island has suffered extensive damage.Tsunami waves reaching up to 15 metres hit the Ha'apia island group, where Mango is located, and the west coast of Tonga's main island, Tongatapu, Mr Sovaleni's office said.Residents have been moved to evacuation centres as 56 houses were destroyed or seriously damaged on that coast, Dr Setoya said.New Zealand Defence Force images showed tarpaulins being used

Local water supplies were contaminated by volcanic ash.Defence Minister Peeni Henare said the journey for both ships would take three days.""Water is among the highest priorities for Tonga at this stage and HMNZS Aotearoa can carry 250,000 litres, and produce 70,000 litres per day through a desalination plant,"" Mr Henare said.""The survey and diving teams are able to show changes to the seabed in the shipping channels and ports. They will also assess wharf infrastructure to assure the future delivery of aid and support from the sea.""Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta, said ashfall on Nuku'alofa airport runway was preventing humanitarian relief flights from landing.Mr Veitch said the airport was expected to be operational by Tuesday but ""more ash has been falling"", delaying clean-up operations.Australian planes and a naval supply ship were also being loaded with medical and engineering equipment.An Australian C130 Hercules aircraft was awaiting clearance to land in Tonga. Naval ships will take five days to travel from Australia to Tonga.The landing helicopter dock ship HMAS Adelaide will be deployed as a base for Australian helicopters that will service populations on outer islands, said Foreign Minister Marise Payne.""Our high commissioner, Rachael Moore, has had a very good meeting today with the Tongan Prime Minister, and he is very grateful for Australia's assistance and assistance also of New Zealand,"" she said on Tuesday.The government statement outlined the devastation that has occurred as a result of the January 15 eruption, which has left the island isolated and largely without communication.""Domestic and international flights have been deferred until further notice as the airports undergo clean-up,"" the government said.Tonga's communications were also cut and could be down for weeks after the eruption damaged an undersea cable that supplies the country with internet via Fiji.Southern Cross Cables Chief Technical Officer Dean Veverka told ABC Radio Melbourne the cable breakage may have been caused by an underwater landslide.""We understand that there's a cable break about 37 kilometres from Tonga and there's also a break on their domestic cable about 47 kilometres from Tonga,"" Mr Veverka said.Mr Veverka said the cable is about 14 millimetres thick — about the size of a household garden hose — and could take until the second week of February to repair.He said a repair ship is on its way from Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea to Samoa, where it will pick up spare cable.""It could take a lot longer than normal repairs, just because it may be buried under landslide, it could have moved a significant distance before we can find the cable,"" he said.Tonga Cable said the cable could not be repaired until volcanic activity ceased.Telstra offered support to the Digicel Pacific team to get Tonga reconnected as soon as possible.""We've mobilised teams from across the business to work with the Digicel Pacific technical team to find a satellite communications solution to help restore some communications as quickly as possible,"" a Telstra spokesperson said.""We're now working alongside DFAT to get the equipment shipped in order to connect with one of the forthcoming planned RAAF flights.""Once the plane arrives in Tonga, our team will work with the Digicel team to get the satellite equipment working.""On Wednesday evening, Digicel said it had restored international call connectivity to Tonga.","Disasters and Accidents, Foreign Aid, Tonga, ",2022-01-19 02:29:29+00:00

Previous reports confirmed two fatalities. ""The search and rescue operation began immediately on Sunday morning...of the two reported missing, one has been found alive and the other, a British national was unfortunately the first fatality,"" the government said. The number of people with injuries remains unconfirmed. The government statement outlined the devastation that has occurred as a result of the January 15 eruption, which has damaged submarine cables creating communication outages and left many Tongan residents homeless. All houses on Mango Island have been destroyed, and only two homes remain on Fonoifua Island, while there is 'extensive damage' on Nomuka Island.Tonga's armed forces have been deployed to the affected areas, ""with another health team, additional resources and emergency responders based on reports from the initial mission for Mango, Donoifua and Nomuka.

after the eruption of the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha'apai volcano, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.Around 2 centimetres of volcanic ash and dust has fallen on Tongatapu —Tonga's main island— since Saturday's eruption, which triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific Ocean.Ash in the air and on the ground has raised concerns about air pollution and the potential contamination of food and water supplies, the WHO said.Locals have been advised to drink bottled water and wear masks outdoors to avoid breathing in the ash.""Thankfully, all health facilities on Tongatapu are fully functioning and clean-up efforts have been initiated,"" the WHO said.It said initial reports were that around 100 houses had been damaged and 50 completely destroyed on Tongatapu. ""Many [Tongans] remain displaced, with 89 people taking shelter in evacuation centres on the island of 'Eua and many more seeking shelter with relatives,"" the WHO said. ""The Ha'apai and Vava'u island groups … remain out of contact with the capital [Nuku'alofa].""There were particular concerns about the smaller and low-lying islands of Mango and Fonoi in the Ha'apai group, the WHO said.Scientists have warned that volcanic ash could deliver long-lasting damage to coral reefs, erode coastlines and disrupt fisheries.The scientists have been studying satellite images and looking to the past to predict the future of the remote region.Since the initial eruption, the volcano has been releasing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide — two gases that create acid rain when they interact with water and oxygen in the atmosphere.With Tonga's tropical climate, ""there is likely to be acid rain around Tonga for a while to come"", according to volcanologist Shane Cronin from the University of Auckland.Acid rain causes widespread crop damage, and could ruin Tongan staples such as taro, corn, bananas and garden vegetables.""Depending on how long the eruptions last, food security could be compromised,"" Professor Cronin said.Satellite imagery shows the plume from the volcano spreading westward, which means Tonga could be spared some of this acid rain, although Fiji could then be in its path.In a bulletin on Monday, the UN humanitarian affairs office said Fiji was monitoring its air quality, and had advised people to cover their household water tanks and stay indoors in the event of rain.Tonga's exclusive economic zone of nearly 700,000 marine square kilometres is 1,000 times larger than its land area.And most Tongans get their food — and livelihood — from the ocean.While scientists have yet to investigate on the ground, ""the few pictures that are available seem to show a blanket … of ash"" on land, according to Marco Brenna, a geologist from the University of Otago in New Zealand.In the ocean, that ash can be harmful to marine life.Weeks before Saturday's eruption, Tonga Geological Services had warned that nearby seawater was contaminated with toxic volcanic discharge, and that fishermen should ""assume fish in these waters are poisoned or poisonous"".Inevitably, the weekend's huge eruption has made the situation worse.Murky, ash-filled water near the volcano will deprive fish of food and wipe out spawning beds.Some fish will perish, and survivors will be forced to migrate, scientists said.Further, changes in the structure of the sea floor could create new obstacles for fishing vessels.""It will be a while before the same or new fishing grounds will be restored,"" Dr Brenna said.Falling ash can also smother coral reefs that, in Tonga, are the mainstay of a tourism industry that brought in up to $5 million per year before the COVID-19 pandemic.Even before the eruption, Tonga's reefs were threatened by disease outbreaks and the effects of climate change, including coral bleaching and increasingly strong cyclones.Now, ""vast areas of the reefs in the immediate impact area at Hunga Tonga are probably buried and smothered by large deposits of volcanic ash"", according to Tom Schils, a marine biologist from the University of Guam who has studied volcanic eruptions and corals in the Northern Mariana Islands.Such eruptions also release more iron into the water, which can boost the growth of blue-green algae and sponges, which further degrade reefs.Reefs may have to start over — a process that could take years, according to Brian Zgliczynski, a coral reef ecologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.""Species more tolerant of poor water quality will arrive first,"" Dr Zgliczynski said.Meanwhile, hard corals and fish would take longer to return, he added.A loss of coral reefs would also affect Tonga's ability to cope with rising waters and storm surges.This is a concern for Tonga, where climate change is driving the sea level to rise by about 6 millimetres per year, double the global average.In a 2015 report, Tonga valued its natural storm buffers — including coral reefs as well as coastal seagrasses and mangroves — at some $11 million annually.With the latest eruption, a Tongan sea-level gauge recorded a tsunami wave of 1.19 metres before it stopped reporting.Tsunamis are known to cause rapid coastal erosion.And before communication systems went down, videos revealed damage to man-made seawalls.""Coastal defences and reclaimed land could all be strongly impacted by the tsunami waves, leaving the islands more vulnerable,"" Professor Cronin said.ABC/wires","Agricultural Crops, Disasters and Accidents, Environment, Fiji, Foreign Aid, Marine Biology, Oceans and Reefs, Pacific, Tonga,

120,https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2022-01-18/tonga-volcano-tsunami-hunga-eruption-why-so-big/100761750,"When the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha'apai volcano erupted in Tonga on Saturday, it sent a huge plume 30 kilometres into the sky and a literal shockwave around the world.Every week there are around 20 volcanoes ""showing some signs of unrest"" across the globe, but most are fairly mild, says Scott Bryan, a volcano researcher at the Queensland University of Technology.So what made this volcano so explosive, was the eruption predicted, will it erupt again soon, and are there other volcanoes we should be watching out for?The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano is what is known as a subduction volcano.Subduction zone volcanoes occur along tectonic plate boundaries where one plate is being forced down under another.Subduction volcanoes tend to have dual personalities, according to Professor Bryan.On the one hand, they have slow, passive eruptions that build the classic conical shape of volcanoes like Mt Fuji, and on the other they're violently explosive, as we've seen in Tonga.There are two factors that can lead to a highly explosive eruption, and although it's still too early to say definitively, it appears both factors may have been at play on Saturday.The first is a high concentration of pressurised water vapour and gases in the magma.When that magma hits the surface from deep underground, there's a sudden release of pressure ""like opening a champagne bottle"", which causes the gases to explosively expand, blasting apart the magma or lava in the process.In the case of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai, researchers had previously looked at the chemical composition of the volcano's lava sediment from an eruption in 2009.They found the lava had ingredients for a powerful explosion, according to Heather Handley, a volcanologist from Monash University who was involved with that research.""We could see from the chemistry of the rocks that the magma of that eruption was moving to the surface quickly and keeping hold of its gas as well,"" Dr Handley said.The second factor that made the Tongan volcano so explosive was that it was a sub-surface volcano — its lava vent was under the ocean.When magma hits water, it causes an explosive interaction between the two as the water rapidly flashes to steam, Professor Bryan said.""It's the external addition of the water and the heat of the magma coming into contact with it,"" he said.""That flashes steam and that's driven the explosion.""The volcano's vent was above water before disappearing below sea level just a few days (or hours) prior to Saturday's catastrophic eruption, according to Dr Handley.""The satellite images, if you compare from the 6th of January to two hours before the eruption, somewhere in that time frame the middle cone had gone,"" she said.A smaller eruption may have blown apart the cone, allowing the incursion of seawater into the vent, which then catalysed the larger eruption.But Professor Bryan suspects an underwater slip or collapse may have magnified the eruption and caused the tsunami that went with it.""You need to displace ocean water to make tsunamis,"" he said.""It's more than just the eruption. Something else has happened underwater that's triggered this explosion.""The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano was on a roughly 1,000-year eruption cycle, according to high-temperature geochemist Oliver Nebel of Monash University.But that doesn't mean we could have pinpointed with any real accuracy when it was going to erupt.""We know … it's due [to erupt], but that could mean yesterday or it could be in 100 years,"" Dr Nebel said.But there were some signs Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai was becoming more active, he said.""The volcano had erupted in recent days in the lead-up to the massive eruption.""Dr Handley said the volcano entered a phase of increased activity sometime around December 19-20.""In the past few weeks, you've been seeing what we call phreatomagmatic eruptions, where water and magma are coming into contact,"" she said.""You get these dark feathered plumes that come out.""According to the database of the Global Volcanism Program, gas steam and ash plumes had risen at least 12.2 kilometres into the air by late December, but activity had ""significantly decreased"" by early January.The difficulty in evacuating people when volcanoes enter more active phases is that often they may settle down again without a catastrophic eruption, Dr Nebel said.Evacuating people any time a volcano showed signs of activity would not only be costly, but it would lead to an erosion of public trust in scientists, he added.When a volcano like this erupts, it often happens as a series of eruptions, rather than a one-off.Records from the Global Volcanism Program show that the last period of activity at Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai, which began in December 2014, lasted just over a year.During that period a new island was formed, about 120 metres high and about 2 kilometres long.Dr Nebel said he suspected there would likely be more eruptions in the near future.""I think it will likely erupt again in the coming days, weeks, months,"" he said.""It's really hard, slash impossible, to predict whether it will be the same severity.""A huge eruption like this one may mean that any following eruptions will be less intense; however, again, there are no guarantees.The problem is that the magma chamber can be tens of kilometres deep, and there's no way of knowing how much more magma is still in the chamber.""The only thing we can say is that it has erupted now, so the likelihood of there being much more underneath is low, but we have seen [multiple large eruptions] before in the past,"" Dr Nebel said.Similarly, Dr Handley said it was ""impossible to tell"" at this point whether we had seen the biggest eruption, or if there were more to come.Professor Bryan said if there was an underwater landslide that precipitated the eruption, that may actually be good news in terms of future eruptions.""Hopefully if there was a landslide or whatever happened on Saturday, it's stabilised the slopes to some extent,"" he said.""[In that case] we may have some explosions or tall columns, but we're not going to get the tsunamis.""Though the fallout and potential death toll is still unknown, Professor Bryan said the earlier eruptions at least gave the people of Tonga some forewarning of what may have been coming.He also said the fact it happened in daylight was a small positive.""By the sounds of it, most people saw the early signs. Obviously there was a sonic boom and they'd seen the columns from the weeks before.""If this happened like three hours later in the middle of the night [when] people are asleep, it could have been a lot worse.""Volcanoes like Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire — a roughly 40,000km line around the Pacific Ocean tracing the edge of tectonic plates, where a large share of the world's volcanoes are found. However, these have what is referred to as an ""independent magmatic plumbing system"", Dr Nebel said.What that means is that their magma chambers and any conduits and vents are in no way connected to other volcanoes, and the eruption of one doesn't precipitate the eruption of any others.Across the world there are more than 1,300 active volcanoes, but active doesn't mean erupting now, according to Dr Handley.""To be active, we say they erupted in the last 10,000 years,"" she said.In any week there are around 20 volcanoes showing signs of activity, according to Professor Bryan.The Global Volcanism Program listed 46 volcanoes as ""in continuing eruptions status"" as of December 9, 2021.A number of these are in Australia's Pacific neighbours, including Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tonga.As we've seen, predicting which volcanoes may be an imminent threat to life can prove extremely difficult, but volcano experts say more monitoring and tsunami early warning systems can help.""All of these volcanoes need monitoring, because our ability to predict these eruptions sometimes is in the order of hours,"" Dr Nebel said.","Disasters and Accidents, Environment, Pacific, Science and Technology, Tonga, Volcanic Eruptions, ",2022-01-18 03:04:01+00:00

Stuff like this just doesn't happen to people like us. But then it does.""Two women reportedly drowned in Peru when large waves caused by the eruption swept them away.The Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Tonga, Fatafehi Fakafanua, said there were reports of waves up to 10 metres high hitting some islands after Saturday's volcanic eruption, and more unconfirmed deaths.He said information was trickling in from around the archipelago.""Some of the severely damaged areas, we've heard reports of waves that reached 5 to 10 metres high,"" he said. ""As you can imagine, that would be very devastating for a low-lying island.""There are a few reports of deaths, but we're still waiting for more information on that front.""Initial reports suggested no mass casualties on the main island of Togatapu, but two people were reported missing and the capital Nuku'alofa was badly damaged, as were resorts and homes along the island's western beaches.""Further volcanic activity cannot be ruled out,"" the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update.OCHA said only minor injuries had been reported but emphasised formal assessments, especially of the outer islands, had yet to be released, with communications badly hit.The uninhabited volcanic island of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai all but disappeared following the blast, according to satellite images from around 12 hours later.The Pacific archipelago was blanketed in ash and volcanic ash clouds spread to countries thousands of kilometres to the west.The OCHA said there had been no contact from the Ha'apai group of islands and there was ""particular concern"" about two small low-lying islands — Fonoi and Mango — where an active distress beacon had been detected.According to the Tonga government, 36 people live on Mango and 69 on Fonoi.Australia and New Zealand sent surveillance flights to Tonga on Monday to assess damage and Pacific Minister Zed Seselja said Australian police had visited beaches and reported significant damage, with ""houses thrown around"".Senator Seselja said he expected the HMAS Adelaide to be deployed tomorrow, with the ash cloud caused by an underwater volcanic eruption still obstructing any ability to send supplies by air.""There is still a significant amount of ash, I understand, at the airport,"" he told the Nine network.""It was hoped the airport might open today but that's more likely now to be tomorrow, and as soon as that is open, we will be able to deliver some of those humanitarian supplies through those C-130 aircraft that are ready to go from Amberley.""Senator Seselja said water, food, fuel, and clean up equipment was being prioritised.Lord Fakafanua said there was still a lot of initial rescue and recovery work underway.""In terms of getting airlift and supplies into Tonga ... they're trying to sweep the runway as far as I heard, they may be able to have the runway ready for the air forces to land the supplies by Wednesday,"" he said.However, the deputy head of mission for the High Commission of Tonga in Canberra, Curtis Tu'ihalangingie, expressed concern about the potential for COVID-19 to spread as aid begins to arrive.""As much as we are going to send assistance to Tonga, we will still need to follow the COVID-19 protocols, to keep the people and the population safe, rather than us sending assistance, and there is a tsunami of COVID hitting Tonga,"" he said. Senator Seselja also said the Australian government was working with Telstra to set up ""some temporary equipment"" to provide an interim telecommunications system.Tonga's internet has been out since the eruption, meaning many families abroad are anxiously waiting to hear if their loved ones are safe. The company that owns the single underwater fibre-optic cable that connects the island nation to the rest of the world said it likely was severed in the eruption, and repairs could take weeks.The New Zealand High Commission reported significant damage along the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu, where there are many vacation resorts, and the waterfront of the capital, Nuku'alofa.A satellite image posted by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) indicated there was damage to scores of structures on Nomuka island.The Ha'atafu Beach Resort, on the Hihifo peninsula, 21km west of the capital Nuku'alofa, was ""completely wiped out"", the owners said on Facebook.The family that manages the resort had run for their lives through the bush to escape the tsunami, it said.""The whole western coastline has been completely destroyed along with Kanukupolu village,"" the resort said.The Red Cross said it was mobilising its network to respond to what it called the worst volcanic eruption the Pacific has experienced in decades.The organisation's Asia Pacific director, Alexander Matheou, said water purification to remove ash contamination, providing shelter, and reuniting families were the priorities.ABC/wires","Disasters and Accidents, Tonga, United Kingdom, Volcanic Eruptions, ",2022-01-17 18:38:45+00:00

to be revealed at its epicentre near Tonga, but its impact was felt right around the Pacific and, indeed, around the other side of the world.When the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha'apai volcano erupted on Saturday, it caused a plume of ash, steam and gas to rise like a mushroom above the blue Pacific waters.It lead to tsunami warnings and evacuation orders in several countries, and caused huge waves on several South Pacific islands.In Peru, two people drowned off a beach after unusually high waves hit coastal areas.A sonic boom could be heard as far away as Alaska and tsunami waves battered boats in Japan, New Zealand and California, but did not appear to cause any widespread damage.There were reports of floods in parts of Fiji, Chile and Ecuador.In Tonga, it sent tsunami waves crashing across the shore and people rushing to higher ground.Dr Heather Handley — a volcanologist and Adjunct Associate Professor at Monash University — said the effects of the eruption were felt all around the world.""The ash and gas plume from Saturday's eruption reached the stratosphere,"" she said.""Present estimates indicate that the plume reached 30 kilometres [above the Earth], making it a very powerful eruption.""It was unclear if further eruptions would happen, she said.""But volcanic activity is likely to continue over the coming days,"" she said.The eruption was so powerful, it was detected at a Scottish weather station.Professor Hannah Power, who is a coastal and marine scientist at the University of Newcastle, described how far the impact travelled.""The sea level gauge at Nuku'alofa, Tonga, recorded a tsunami wave of 1.19 metres before it stopped reporting,"" she said.""Waves of [more than] a metre were also observed in Vanuatu and Norfolk Island, Australia, and as far afield as Chile.""Waves of over 50 centimetres were measured in several locations in New South Wales, Queensland, Fiji, the Cook Islands, New Caledonia, and New Zealand.""Across the Pacific, tsunami waves were observed along both the North and South American coastlines and in Japan.""Professor Power said small but measurable waves were still being detected in Australia as a result of the tsunami.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tonga's capital, Nuku'alofa, was covered in a thick film of volcanic dust, contaminating water supplies and making fresh water a vital need.However, so far, it seems none of the country's 105,000 inhabitants were killed, although concerns remain for the fate of people on some of the smaller islands nearer the volcano, which lies 65km north of Tonga.On Monday, the deputy head of mission at the Tongan High Commission in Australia, Curtis Tuihalangingie, said there had, so far, been minimal damage reported.Mr Tuihalangingie said he had spoken with family and friends before communication was cut, and they described the eruption as ""unbelievable"".""They were not able to explain to us the noise and the sound and what happened at the time,"" he said.People on Tonga described their country as looking like a moonscape as they began the task of cleaning up from the tsunami waves and ash fall caused by the eruption.On Monday, Australia and New Zealand sent surveillance flights to further assess the extent of the damage.A towering ash cloud had prevented either nation's military from launching any flights earlier to the Pacific island nation.Australia has also announced an initial humanitarian aid package of $1million, while New Zealand has offered $NZ500,000 ($472,000), with a promise of more when further help is needed.More than 20 Peruvian ports were temporarily closed as a precautionary measure amid warnings that the volcano was causing abnormally high waves, Peru's National Institute of Civil Defence said.Peruvian police said two bodies were found by officers, and the area where they were located has since been declared unsuitable for bathers.TV images showed several homes and businesses flooded by seawater in coastal areas in northern and central Peru.The Peruvian Navy had reported that a tsunami alert was ruled out.In Japan, about 230,000 people were advised to evacuate on Sunday as waves of more than a metre hit coastal areas.The country's meteorological agency issued tsunami warnings in the early hours on Sunday.Public broadcaster NHK said no damage nor casualties had been reported, interrupting its regular programming to report on the tsunami advisory spanning the entire eastern coast of the Japanese archipelago.In a briefing, a Japan Meteorological Agency official urged people not to go near the sea until the tsunami advisory and more serious tsunami warnings had been lifted.The alert is still in place only in Japan's prefecture of Iwate, the area devastated by the 2011 massive quake and tsunami, while other prefectures facing the Pacific, from Hokkaido in the north to Kagoshima and its remote islands, have been placed under tsunami advisories.The warnings were the first in more than five years.The ash cloud also led to a flight from Japan to New Caledonia being diverted to Brisbane overnight on Sunday.Tsunami advisories were issued for Hawaii, Alaska and the US Pacific coast.Residents were advised to move away from the coastline to higher ground and to pay attention to instructions from their local emergency management officials.""We don't issue an advisory for this length of coastline as we've done — I'm not sure when the last time was — but it really isn't an everyday experience,"" the tsunami warning coordinator for the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, Dave Snider, said.The US Geological Survey estimated the eruption caused the equivalent of a magnitude-5.8 earthquake.ABC/Wires","Australia, Disasters and Accidents,

They told us to stay indoors and cover our doors and windows because it's dangerous,"" she said.""I felt sorry for the people. Everyone just froze when the explosion happened. We rushed home.""Outside the house, people were seen carrying umbrellas for protection.Ms Ardern said New Zealand was unable to send a surveillance flight over Tonga on Sunday because the ash cloud was 19,000 metres high.One complicating factor to any international aid effort is that Tonga has so far managed to avoid any outbreaks of COVID-19.Ms Ardern said New Zealand's military staff were all fully vaccinated and willing to follow any protocols established by Tonga.Dave Snider, the tsunami warning coordinator for the National Tsunami Warning Centre in Palmer, Alaska, said it was very unusual for a volcanic eruption to affect an entire ocean basin, and the spectacle was both ""humbling and scary"".The tsunami waves caused damage to boats as far away as New Zealand and Santa Cruz, California, but did not appear to cause any widespread damage. Tsunami advisories were earlier issued for Japan, Hawaii, Alaska and the US Pacific coast.The US Geological Survey estimated the eruption caused the equivalent of a magnitude-5.8 earthquake. Scientists said tsunamis generated by volcanoes rather than earthquakes were relatively rare.Rachel Afeaki-Taumoepeau, who chairs the New Zealand Tonga Business Council, said she hoped the relatively low level of the tsunami waves would have allowed most people to get to safety, although she worried about those living on islands closest to the volcano.She said she had not yet been able to contact her friends and family in Tonga.""We are praying that the damage is just to infrastructure and people were able to get to higher land,"" she said.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote on Twitter he was ""deeply concerned for the people of Tonga as they recover from the aftermath of a volcanic eruption and tsunami. The United States stands prepared to provide support to our Pacific neighbours.""Tonga gets its internet via an undersea cable from Suva, Fiji.All internet connectivity with Tonga was lost about 6:40pm (local time) Saturday, said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis for the network intelligence firm Kentik.On Tonga, which is home to about 105,000 people, video posted to social media showed large waves washing ashore in coastal areas and swirling around homes, a church and other buildings.A Twitter user identified as Dr Faka'iloatonga Taumoefolau posted video showing waves crashing ashore.""Can literally hear the volcano eruption, sounds pretty violent,"" he wrote, adding in a later post: ""Raining ash and tiny pebbles, darkness blanketing the sky.""The explosion of the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha'apai volcano, about 64 kilometres north of Nuku'alofa, was the latest in a series of dramatic eruptions.In late 2014 and early 2015, eruptions created a small new island and disrupted international air travel to the Pacific archipelago for several days.Earth-imaging company Planet Labs PBC had watched the island in recent days after a new volcanic vent began erupting in late December.Satellite images showed how drastically the volcano had shaped the area, creating a growing island off Tonga.""The surface area of the island appears to have expanded by nearly 45 per cent due to ashfall,"" Planet Labs said days before the latest activity.Following Saturday's eruption, residents in Hawaii, Alaska and along the US Pacific coast were advised to move away from the coastline to higher ground.Savannah Peterson watched in shock as the water rose several feet in a matter of minutes in front of her oceanfront house in Pacifica, California, just south of San Francisco.""It came up so fast, and a few minutes after that it was down again.

That's what drove the government's decision making,"" he told the ABC.After months of discussion and false starts, the final deal seems to have come together quickly.Documents from inside Treasury, obtained using the Freedom of Information (FOI) process, show a one-day process as approval was sought from different ministers involved.The morning after the deal was back ""on"", Ms Rogers updated Luke Yeaman, deputy secretary of the macroeconomic group, and Vicki Wilkinson, first assistant secretary of the international economic and security division.Three other Treasury officials were on the communication, but their names were redacted in documents received by the ABC.The email appears to reference the Finance Minister, Trade, Tourism and Investment Minister's Office, the Treasurer's Office and a 'minsub' – a ministerial submission, but Treasury has not confirmed if this is accurate.""The letter has been signed by the FM and is currently with the TTIMO. We are told it should arrive in the TO later today. We'll send up a new minsub in the next couple of hours. We haven't changed the letter, but the submission will outline the changes that led to the delay,"" Ms Rogers emailed.Through the afternoon, emails suggest the signed contract moved from the Treasurer's office to the Trade Minister's. An unsigned copy was circulated on email and by a form of communication redacted in the documents. The signed copy was handled in person.""It will be walked from office to office,"" Ms Rogers added.By 3:00pm it was done.""We have updated the ministerial submission to reflect last minute changes to the transaction,"" Ms Rogers wrote.""We understand that the letter will be walked around once signed from the Trade Minister's office. I understand that they have been in contact.""While the emails describe last-minute changes, a search for Treasury analysis of the changing deal came up empty.A search for Treasury reports noting Digicel in the fortnight before the transaction – and the day after it was announced – was refused because Treasury ""holds no documents with the scope of your request"".""I arranged for officers in my division to search Treasury records for material relevant to your request. These searches included searches of emails and Treasury's file management system. I am satisfied that no such documents exist,"" Jim Hagan, chief adviser of the international economics and security division of Treasury wrote in refusing the request.This does not suggest that no analysis was done by Treasury, just that it was not captured in the FOI application.It also does not capture analysis that may have been conducted by other departments or agencies.One document was not released because it went before Cabinet and is exempt from FOI.

Pōhiva, who died in 2019.""This is the first election since 1987 that the veteran pro-democracy campaigner, the late ʻAkilisi Pōhiva, the former prime minister, is not a part of,"" Associate Professor Koloamatangi said.""It will be interesting to see what kind of outcome there is ... because, obviously, his passing has left a gap in the political landscape in Tonga and his influence also will be missing."" Prime Minister Pohiva Tuʻiʻonetoa was elected soon after Mr Pohiva's death. Additionally, pandemic-related border closures mean thousands of Tongans either stuck or working overseas, will not be able to cast their vote, including an estimated 5,000 Tongan citizens in Australia.Samuela Halahala from the Tonga National Youth Congress believes for those who can get to a ballot box, the key issue for most voters will be the drugs crisis that Tonga is struggling to cope with.""It's taking everyone by surprise,"" Mr Halahala said.""Tonga is not used to this stuff and the change that comes with it; it's just overwhelming for everyone.""Tonga is no longer just a transit point for drug smugglers taking their product from South America to large markets in Australia and New Zealand — the kingdom has seen a dramatic rise in the use of illicit drugs including cocaine and methamphetamine.""Most of these youth ... maybe they started off with marijuana, but they ... slowly graduated to doing meth,"" Mr Halahala said.""We visit a lot of communities ... here in Tonga, all around the other islands, and we've seen the problems.""Mr Halahala said a higher number of students dropped out of school this year than the past three years and that substance abuse was one of the main factors.Director of Tonga's Women and Children Crisis Centre (WCCC) Ofa Gutenbeil Likiliki agrees the country is at crisis point, with the situation worsening significantly in the past five years, since Tonga's last election.""What the crisis centre is trying to do [is to] get decision-makers and key stakeholders to understand the strong link between the drug impact on gender-based violence and ... all forms of violence against women and children,"" Ms Gutenbeil Likiliki said.""Because right now, there's a disconnect, thinking that they are two separate issues.""All our issues are interconnected, we can't just deal with one as an isolated issue, we have to kind of address all our issues together, because it impacts on each other.""With a population of just 100,000, Ms Gutenbeil Likiliki and Mr Halahala believe fixing the country's drug problem is possible, but Associate Professor Koloamatangi said it was only possible through help from wealthier neighbours.""It's difficult because the problem is not created in Tonga and the reason for the [drug] trade is also not found in Tonga specifically,"" Associate Professor Koloamatangi said.""So other nations will have to come to the party for Tonga to be able to resolve this issue.""Anti-corruption organisation Transparency International surveyed 6,000 adults from across Pacific Islands and found 61 per cent thought corruption was a significant problem in their government.Mapa Taumololo, an independent candidate running in today's election, said Tonga was no exception.""That's the major issue I've heard from the communities,"" Mr Taumololo said.""They really want leaders to fight against corruption.""At 33, he is one of the youngest in the field of 73 candidates in the running for one of the 17 seats.Mr Taumololo previously worked in the public service, but now he wants to try and create change from within the government.""I realised there's lots of loopholes in the system, and also the parliamentary procedures,"" he said.""And unfortunately, I haven't heard from the parliamentarians that they have the guts to fix those loopholes.""In July, a government minister and her husband were jailed for misappropriating money from a vocational education program that had received Australian government funding.While in March 2020, former prime minister Lord Tu'ivakan was found guilty over his role in a passports-for-sale scandal involving Chinese nationals.Mr Taumololo believes voters in his constituency have had enough of poor behaviour.""They are very supportive of trying to establish the anti-corruption commission to fight against corruption in Tonga,"" he said.Tonga recorded its first case of COVID-19 in October this year after a case was detected in a traveller from New Zealand. According to the World Health Organization, it remains Tonga's only case to date.Associate Professor Koloamatangi said, like elsewhere in the world, today's elections will be ""a COVID-19 election"".""That means a lot will depend on what the government has done in managing the pandemic and keeping the country safe in terms of border closures and lockdowns.""But Mr Taumololo said voters will also be looking ahead to how a new government handles COVID-19 and how it might reopen Tonga's border.""They're concerned that the Ministry of Health does not have the capacity ... to cater for, I think, more than 15 or 16 [active] cases,"" he said.""We are at risk, the whole of our communities, because we're not ready, facility-wise and capacity-wise.""Associate Professor Koloamatangi said as the world moves to living with COVID, international aid from countries like Australia will be vital in Tonga's reopening and management of the disease.Currently, Losaline Ma'asi is the only female MP in Tonga and of the 73 candidates running in the election, just 12 are women.""Numbers aren't looking so great and I'm predicting that we're not going to get any significant change in this election, we'll be lucky if we get one woman,"" Ms Gutenbeil Likiliki said. ""We're still struggling to get more women into parliament, even though we've had some constitutional and legislative reforms.""That's connected back to ... our cultural and our traditional and religious kind of thinking that the biggest decision making positions should be reserved for men.""And so to change that it will mean a generational kind of investment.""","Elections, Government and

footy field he is turning his attention to a different cause. The young rugby union champion is among a group of influential Pacific Islanders using their platforms to promote public health messages relating to COVID-19. Genia says he feels compelled to speak up in attempt to combat misinformation and vaccine hesitancy, which is rife across the region. Papua New Guinea's health system is buckling under pressure as the Delta stain spreads throughout the country and social media has been blamed for contributing to vaccine hesitancy.""There's a lot of hesitation and apprehension towards the [COVID-19] vaccine because there's not the right information out there,"" Genia told the ABC's Pacific Beat program.""People don't have access to TVs, they don't have access to written materials, or the radio, and a lot of the information gets passed on to each other second-hand, or through social media. ""And I think we all know that social media has sort of created a platform where everybody's an expert on everything."" Genia has played for the Australian Wallabies, the Queensland Reds and is currently signed with a Japanese team, the Kintetsu Liners. He is also a UNICEF Australia ambassador, and recently released a Facebook video sharing his thoughts about the COVID-19 vaccine. ""I do think the best way we can protect ourselves [and] our loved ones, is to get vaccinated,"" he says in the clip, which has had more than 27,000 views.For Genia, it is an issue that is also close to home. ""My mum had COVID, my brother had COVID, I've had cousins and friends [who've] passed away because of the disease,"" he said.  ""I mean, it's heartbreaking."" More than eight months into the vaccine rollout, only about 4 per cent of the eligible population in PNG have had the jab. In September, PNG gave away 30,000 vaccine doses to Vietnam because there was not enough demand. Now PNG is experiencing a surge in critical cases of mostly unvaccinated citizens. Genia wants people to have access to accurate information in order to make informed choices about their health.""I think if you do that, more often than not, you find that people will take the vaccine,"" he said.While PNG may be experiencing the largest COVID outbreak, vaccine hesitancy is an issue across many Pacific communities.Tongan royals, Crown Prince Tupouto'a 'Ulukalala and HRH Princess Angelika Latufuipeka Tuku'aho — who is also the High Commissioner of Tonga to Australia — featured in a Facebook video encouraging vaccination, including in Australia's Tongan community.""We would like to remind our communities at this difficult time that we are here for you and that we will overcome these challenges together,"" Princess Latufuipeka says in the video.""We encourage you, your families and our communities to do what is best for us all and to get vaccinated.""Getting your COVID-19 vaccination will give you up to about 90 per cent protection against hospitalisation from COVID-19 and reduces your risk of spreading the virus to others.""Kāinga Tonga we only have one life, get vaccinated.""Lady Roslyn Morauta, the wife of former PNG prime minister Sir Mekere Morauta and a board member for Pacific Friends of Global Health, says getting this message out over the roar of misinformation remains a major challenge. ""My worry is that the pro-vaccination voices have not been loud enough,"" Lady Morauta said.The organisation wants the Australian government to support PNG in designing a targeted COVID information strategy. ""We just have to have a much more active campaign of other respected people like church leaders, and private sector leaders, community leaders, women's leaders, and politicians as well,"" she said.""We have to have a concerted campaign that's very public.""While some public figures are using their platforms to promote vaccinations, others are not. Emmanuel Narokobi is a social media and marking consultant in PNG and says he is frustrated to see some high-profile politicians, singers and even doctors spreading anti-vaccination messages. ""It's a big concern, because obviously we want to trust our doctors, but when ... there's a split between the opinions of doctors, that already creates an issue in terms of everyone wondering what's going on,"" he said.Mr Narokobi believes the best way to combat vaccine misinformation is by engaging with local communities in person. He said face-to-face ""town hall-type community gathering discussions"" would be more effective than putting messages on media platforms, but it was about finding the right approach. ""Not so much putting them down and shouting down to them, but giving them a space where they can sort of ask questions and be answered."" That has been the approach of Aukland-based Pasifika health service, The Fono, which has teamed up with local Instagram influencers to encourage vaccinations. The organisation's chief operating officer Sally Dalhousie says so far it has been a success. ""It's particularly our younger people who are the most resistant and so they respond best with their own,"" Ms Dalhousie said.""And it's easier if we just have a number of people who are out there like a little army, bringing people in [for] vaccination wherever that is the best place for them.""For rugby superstar Genia, his hope for all Pacific Islanders is the same. ""My hope is that there's more conversation created around it, but in a positive sense, in a space where it's safe to be able to express what it is you feel as an individual and then also hear the information."" Read

They should have had a meeting during the weekend instead of waiting until today,"" he said.This morning, flights from Tonagtapu to Vava'u were cancelled due to concerns about the COVID-19 case.Ms Guttennbeil-Likiliki blamed Tonga's upcoming national election, on November 18, for the mixed messaging, when authorities originally denied rumours about the positive case that were circulating earlier last week.""I think, had this not been a campaign period, the communication of what was happening would have been much more clear,"" Ms Guttennbeil-Likiliki said.""We just can't be complacent anymore. And we need factual information. We need our government to be honest, and to be real … and to forget about the campaigning, the political back-and-forth.""Her organisation, which supports mostly women and children fleeing domestic violence, is preparing for a spike in demand due to the lockdown.She said high school students would also be impacted as they prepare for end-of-year exams.""This is the study week before external exams and, so, there's some uncertainty around that because, you know, [they're] not sure if they're going to sit national exams next week,"" she said.Others have called on the government to provide financial support to citizens who will be unable to work during the lockdown period.Read our full coverage on COVID-19 here","COVID-19, Epidemics and Pandemics, Pacific, Tonga, ",2021-11-01 07:53:08+00:00

And then … a rise in crime because people have to turn to crime if they [are] unemployed, to fund their addiction.""So one way of limiting the harm that drugs are doing is at the first instance, and that is on the supply end.""Lord Fakafanua said there was growing evidence that Tonga was a key stopover on international smuggling routes, bringing drugs to Australia and New Zealand.Last month packages containing cocaine began washing up on local beaches in Tonga's north, sparking a widespread search operation.Police ultimately seized 14 kilograms of cocaine and five people — three foreigners and two locals — have now been charged.Lord Fakafanua said Tonga needed to show drug syndicates the country was serious about eliminating trafficking.""There's a common understanding in Tonga that drug offenders get off too lightly,"" he said.""This is even from the criminals themselves.""There is that hope that with the possibility of a death sentence that it would act as a deterrent, and at the very least, it would send the right message that this crime is taken very seriously in our country.""The director of the Eleos Justice group, Mai Sato, said she was surprised by the proposal because Tonga had been ""de facto abolitionist"" for such a long time.""Tonga's last execution was in 1982 and they don't have anyone on death row at the moment,"" Ms Sato said.""This is a concerning development.""She said adding drug offences to the list of capital crimes in Tonga was unlikely to help the situation.Tonga was trying to adopt the ""war on drugs"" rhetoric which began in the US with the Nixon administration, she said.""That was a complete failure,"" she said.""What happened in the US is that the US prison population skyrocketed, and then still, the drug supply was ample.""There's no evidence to suggest that this policy works, and we have no proof that death penalty works as a deterrent.""The proposed law was also unlikely to affect those who actually ran the drug syndicates, she added.Often the people who were prosecuted were low-level couriers and even when a senior organised crime figure was removed they were quickly replaced.""So I think being tough on drugs and drug trafficking doesn't really solve the issue,"" she said.Director of Tonga's Women and Children Crisis Centre Ofa Guttenbeil-Likiliki sees the effects of drug abuse in the community first hand.Ms Guttenbeil-Likiliki said there had been an increase over the past five years in women seeking to flee violent situations that were linked to drug use or trafficking.""It's definitely one of the biggest problems that our country is facing,"" Ms Guttenbeil-Likiliki said.She's also seeing drug problems among children.One young boy had become addicted after starting to use methamphetamine to stay up all night studying.""It was the thing to do amongst his peers,"" she said.When he could not stop using it, he was targeted by his neighbours in the village.""He went one night to try and attempt suicide and thankfully his grandmother arrived home in time,"" she said.Despite her concerns, Ms Guttenbeil-Likiliki does not support the death penalty.Instead she believes tackling the underlying social issues that fuel the problem should be the priority.She said Tonga had only approached the situation from a top-down perspective and had failed to work with communities to solve the problem.""Tonga is built on talanoa, and talanoa is conversations, talking, and I don't think we've done that simple first step right,"" she said.Ms Guttenbeil-Likiliki added that drug education and recovery programs were desperately needed along with an increased focus on vulnerable young people.""We hear it all the time that they're being targeted to be runners for the drug dealers,"" she said.Lord Fakafanua admitted there was not enough being done to address demand or to provide treatment for drug addiction, but he said the challenge was finding adequate funding for public health programs.""It comes down to resources and our government is currently operating on a deficit budget with the current economy,"" he said.""It will be very, very hard to resource, even though this issue is high on government's priority.""He said in the meantime, his proposed law was the first step on what may be a very long road.""We don't want to unnecessarily harm people,"" he said.""However, if there's a small chance that [capital punishment] becomes a deterrent, then no doubt that would save and have an impact on our youth and people who are suffering from drugs.""","Drug Offences, Drug and Substance Abuse, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Prisons and Punishment, Tonga, ",2021-08-27 18:52:17+00:00

It's a sort of deep knowledge that it's all possible.""Mr Robinson's boat design, particularly its hull, was based on the whaling ships of the 19th and 20th centuries, with a few modern upgrades. ""I took inspiration from those boats and drew up a set of plans for myself,"" he said.""The way that this boat will be more modern in that it is compartmentalised into lots of different, watertight sections. ""So, if one section of the boat was to get holed — [an] unlikely event — then the boat would never sink. ""The boat will be full self-righting, so that, if it does capsize, it will right itself, which is a really important safety feature on a boat like this.""Mr Robinson said a lot of thought had gone into engineering the timber, ensuring the specific types, thickness and sizes were used in the right places.In another nod to traditional methods, Mr Robinson said he planned to navigate much of his journey by the stars.""To do that, you use a sextant, which is an age-old navigation instrument that was commonplace up until the '60s,"" Mr Robinson said.""The boat will be equipped with a GPS and paper charts so, at any point, I'll be able to check my GPS and know exactly where I am and then plot that onto a chart.""Just to be safe, Mr Robinson will have a second, back-up GPS as well as a satellite phone.""That whole process is quite enjoyable for me and I think I've built myself a very strong and light boat for the journey.""","Adventure Books, Brisbane, Carrington, Chile, Construction and Real Estate Industry, Cook Islands, Human Interest, Tonga, Travel and Tourism (Lifestyle and Leisure), ",2021-07-08 22:44:20+00:00

Some are rapped with pride; others are wrapped in discrimination.But two words rarely — if ever — associated with Mount Druitt are ""purity"" and ""innocence"".And yet, these are the qualities that Steven Maaelopa, a local of 25 years, perceives in his area.""Living in Mount Druitt you see a different side to it altogether,"" he says.""There's this innocence and purity and, you know, sense of love and family.""Unfortunately, there is also the dark side.""The ""dark side"" Steven is referring to has been well documented in Australian media over the past decade.Mount Druitt was home to SBS's landmark series Struggle Street, an observational documentary that shone a light on residents' experiences with ice addiction, economic hardship and domestic abuse.But many critics, including the area's then-mayor Stephen Bali, say the curated gaze into locals' lives was ""exploitative"" and little more than ""poverty porn"".For Steven, the program's depiction of life in Mount Druitt has had a lasting effect.""Even going to places like Campbelltown, Liverpool or the inner city … when I share that I'm from Mount Druitt [people say], 'Oh, you're from Struggle Street.'""""The documentary only picked out a few groups of people who do these types of things — like drugs and alcohol — and sort of blanketed it over the whole of Mount Druitt.""Twenty-year-old Moana Tauveve witnessed the struggles of her suburb first-hand while she was growing up.From the window of her school bus and at the local shops, she saw homelessness, alcohol and drug abuse, and violence.But while some of her peers were sucked into this cycle, Moana vowed to forge a different future.""Being brought up around that made me want to bring a positive change to our community,"" she says.""Especially for the younger generations, so they don't have to grow up going through the same thing.""Moana's faith was a driving factor in her passion for social good. Both she and Steven are part of Mount Druitt's small but ever-expanding Bahá'í community.The Bahá'í Faith was founded in the mid-19th century in Persia — modern-day Iran. It's rooted in values of equality, social justice and human rights.Back in Sydney's west, those principles have inspired a spate of activities — from holiday camps and homework support spaces to park rejuvenation projects — that are open to all. And through these community-building activities, the religious community has grown.Steven's parents were some of the first Bahá'ís in the area and, as an education coordinator, he's grown up teaching local kids, including Moana and her brothers Leon and Hayze, about the faith.Steven points out the aim has never been conversion — just 14,000 Australians identified as Bahá'í in the last Census.Instead, he says, the extracurricular activities are about empowering young people to be the change they want to see in the community.""A lot of my friends, they love the faith, but at the same time … their families have their own religion, as well,"" Moana says.For many Bahá'ís in Mount Druitt, the religion arrived via the Pacific Islands. Steven's family comes from Samoa, where 97 per cent of the population identifies as Christian.""When my grandparents became Bahá'ís, back in the late 60s, they had pushback not only by the village, but also by their own family,"" he says.""They kicked them out from that village, and persecuted and abused them.""Around the same time, the then King of Samoa, Malietoa Tanumafili II, also became Bahá'í.Steven says the king deliberately embraced the Faith in a way that didn't insult the culture of the community.""He didn't see a difference [between religions], and I think that's the same with Bahá'ís around the world — we see that all religions are one, and they all come from the same source.""Indeed, Bahá'ís view Jesus as an educator or ""Manifestation of God"". They also regard Muhammad, Krishna, Buddha, Moses and Bahá'u'lláh, the religion's founder, in this same light.But in the Faith's place of origin, followers face state-sanctioned persecution.Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Bahá'ís — Iran's largest non-Muslim religious minority — have been banned from tertiary education. Academics from Iran's Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education have been imprisoned.The religion's spiritual and administrative centre is located in Israel.In Mount Druitt, Steven says the religious community has faced some pushback by locals, too.""Most of it comes from our own people, the Pacific people,"" he says.One family, Steven recalls, viewed it as a ""fake religion"".But later, after learning more about Bahá'í teachings, they eventually became allies and advocates of the Faith.On the other side of Sydney to Mount Druitt, in the leafy, northern suburb of Ingleside, stands a towering nine-sided Bahá'í temple.The number nine is considered a symbol of unity, as reflected in the architecture of Bahá'í ""Houses of Worship"".This temple, which was opened in 1961, serves all of Australasia.For the Bahá'ís of Mount Druitt, the 58-kilometre journey means temple visits are rare, but Steven says locals don't long for a bricks-and-mortar space of their own.He points to a line from the Bahá'í Writings: ""Any spot, where the mention of God is made, through prayer and service, is blessed."" And so, each Friday between 40 and 60 people meet for a devotional gathering in Sydney's west. It's a night of song, prayer, discussion, even entertaining skits.Some attendees are formally part of the Faith; others are allies.Since COVID-19 restrictions, the community has gathered in Popondetta Park, but in a pre-pandemic world, Damoon Sheidai's living room was always the meeting place.""Usually, Friday night is like party night, 'get up to no good' night,"" says 27-year-old Damoon.""Through the spirit that we've tried to create in these in these gatherings, people are attracted to that … it's like, everyone wants to be part of something.""The meet-ups, he says, offered an alternative for local youth, as Bahá'ís abstain from mind-altering substances, including drugs and alcohol.Damoon's living room became a refuge free of teenage temptations and of the harsh realities some attendees faced at home.Many say music is the connective tissue that bonds this community together.Friday gatherings are filled with spiritual song — Bahá'í writings become soulful lyrics, accompanied by acoustic guitars.""When you ask a lot of the youths and children what's their favourite thing about being part of this community, they say, 'The music, the singing,'"" says Steven.""It's almost like a ladder for the spirit.""But in 2770, music with a message isn't limited to Friday nights.Last year, Damoon, Moana and her brothers, and siblings Ruhi and Jada Lavaki formed the hip hop group Manifold.""That's actually where we all met, on Manifold Road,"" says Damoon, who moved to the area a decade ago and now wouldn't call anywhere else home.Damoon jokingly calls himself the ""odd one out"" because of his Persian background, amidst an otherwise Pacific Islander crew.But all are united by their Bahá'í Faith, their love for Mount Druitt, and their desire to inspire and unlock the potential of younger generations.""I know a lot of friends who've gone down the wrong path,"" says Jada, a 15-year-old vocalist and the youngest in the group.""There's a lot of troubles in the streets, especially in their homes.""We're just trying to show it's not weak to speak.""Song by song, the group is addressing the injustices around them.Their debut, Take A Look, identified problems in their area, such as domestic abuse, crime and drug abuse, while the follow-up was a call to action.""Our second song, Stand Up, was more towards, 'Hey guys … it's time for a change to happen right now,'"" Jada's older brother Ruhi explains.Manifold's latest track, Dear Mounty, is a love letter to their neighbourhood, and a testament to the talent and resilience of its residents.In the opening verse, Damoon raps:Take a closer look around, there's hope in the hood and the love is so profoundAnd if you live in Mounty, consider it a bountyMad love for the hood, for my townOf course, Manifold isn't the first hip hop crew to come from Mount Druitt.Over the past few years, local outfit OneFour pioneered Aussie drill, a genre characterised by violent lyrics and trap-influenced beats.Though they've won global recognition, they've also found trouble with the police. Multiple members are now in jail and performances have been banned in the name of public safety.Moana says Manifold and OneFour can't, and shouldn't, be compared.""We don't think we're better than them just because the message that we're sharing is different,"" she says.""They have a lot of love for the community and the kids in the community.""Even so, Bahá'í elder — and dad to Moana, Leon and Hayze — Lalomilo ""Milo"" Tauveve is glad Manifold are creating a new narrative through their lyrics.""As a father … you do your best to raise them up to be good human beings, and hope that they can be those agents of change,"" he says.""And I'm very proud that they are using their talent to bring a positive message to our community.""Manifold hope their music will reach far beyond the 2770 postcode. But as their lyrics make clear, their hearts will always be with dear Mounty.

dog due to the surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tonga's main island of Tongatapu has had the opposite problem.The closure of international borders meant foreign vets from South Pacific Animal Welfare (SPAW) couldn't run their free desexing programs in the country — and without a qualified vet in Tonga, there are now estimated to be more than 20,000 dogs on Tongatapu alone.Angela Glover, vice-president of the Tonga Animal Welfare Society, said the need for veterinary care has never been more urgent.""SPAW are our vets and the last clinic [visit] was December 2019 where they did 410 desexings in five days, which is an incredible amount of dogs to start limiting the reproduction,"" she said.""Due to the pandemic they haven't been able to come over for more than a year now, so the dog population is exploding.""SPAW, which is based in New Zealand, recruits volunteer veterinarians and veterinary nurses from New Zealand and around the world to deliver free services to the islands of Tonga, Fiji, Samoa, Niue and Rarotonga in the Cook Islands.SPAW would usually visit Tonga four to six times a year, and a single SPAW-run clinic is worth around $50,000 in resources and clinical supplies to that island nation.Its lead veterinarian Geoff Neal said SPAW was due to start a concentrated desexing program last year, named Project Kuli, which planned to desex upwards of 1,200 dogs in the western tip of Tongatapu.""Its planned start date was the end of March 2020, right as the world went into lockdowns and borders closed,"" Dr Neal said.""With the borders remaining shut, we also had to cancel all trips planned in 2020 to the other islands and the other usual clinics.""He said they hoped to restart Project Kuli when border conditions allow it.""The 2021 program is at this stage in pause mode until borders open, flights resume and quarantine-free travel is allowed between the islands and New Zealand — SPAW is stuck in New Zealand,"" Dr Neal said.As well as running desexing programs, Ms Glover says foreign veterinary care also includes bringing vital medications to stop sickness and illness among Tonga's animals.This includes medication for fleas and ticks as well as for the highly contagious canine parvovirus, which can cause death if left untreated.""We've seen so many puppies recently die of parvo, and because parvo is so highly contagious, it easily spreads across the islands of Tonga,"" she said.""With no supplies in the clinic, and without anyone here who is a fully qualified vet, then it's very limited in what people can do.""Like most other organisations during the pandemic, SPAW had to rely on technology to continue providing assistance to the region, and Dr Neal said he was able to assist with a range of conditions and issues on Tonga's islands via telemedical support.They were even able to organise for the exportation of animals out of Tonga to New Zealand and America.""Thank goodness for the internet and phones that take pictures and videos, and for the limited freight flights from [New Zealand] to allow some supplies to reach the islands,"" he said.""Unfortunately, telemedicine doesn't allow surgery to happen, and with no qualified veterinarians in the country, it's hard for people who would like hands-on veterinary care, but are severely limited in their access due to COVID-19,"" he said.Ms Glover said her organisation was working with the Tongan Government to raise awareness of the need for a permanent vet in Tonga and, to educate the Tongan public on how to look after animals, including in schools.""It's a very different community here and a lot of livestock are a necessity for the farmers, but the dogs are something that people have as security — don't get me wrong, there's lots of people who love and care for their dogs, but they're just there,"" she said.""A vet was never seen as an essential priority but attitudes are changing, particularly in the last few years where we've been promoting animal welfare so much.""Through the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Forest and Fisheries, the Tongan Government offers animal care in their clinic in Tokomolo for livestock.Ms Glover, while acknowledging the competing priorities of the Government, especially in keeping the country COVID-free, wants to see more.""In some way a permanent vet in Tonga needs to be supported by a national budget because there is a growth in people who want it and need it,"" she said.""The flipside is that, anyone who wants to train in … Tonga will have to study for five to seven years to become qualified, so in the meantime there's a big gap and we need to fill that gap with either volunteers or contract vets.""The Tongan Government has been contacted for comment.","Animal Cruelty,

Frustration is building in states where no progress has been made, with not all state, territory and federal governments agreeing on the path forward.Growers traditionally use local labour, supplemented with backpackers or seasonal workers flown in from overseas.But with a COVID-induced shortfall of 26,000 seasonal workers, produce in some areas is withering before it can be picked and crops are dying before they can be harvested, as debate over what to do about the labour crisis continues. While some states have arrangements for this supplementary workforce, there has been little progress in Victoria and New South Wales, in particular. The horticulture industry's peak body has become increasingly frustrated with the lack of action.""We have been talking about this issue since February and warning of a worker shortage on farms unless something is done,"" Ausveg national public affairs manager Tyson Cattle said.""We need thousands, tens of thousands, more workers and we needed them yesterday — already Queensland crops have been left in the field to die.""There has been much criticism of the inaction of state governments in finalising quarantine arrangements for foreign workers. However, Mr Cattle said the problem could be solved with the stroke of a pen if the Federal Government set up a travel bubble for Pacific Islanders.He suggested the New Zealand travel bubble system be adapted to include 22,000 pre-vetted islander workers.Federal Agriculture Minister David Littleproud this week repeated calls for the states to take action and fix the situation.He said the situation had been coming ""at us like a freight train"" since March.""We continue to press them to say that we're ready to stamp the visas … but we still haven't seen them come up with any large-scale quarantine arrangements,"" Mr Littleproud said.Jaclyn Symes was replaced as Victoria's Agriculture Minister just before Christmas. Prior to her departure, Ms Symes repeatedly told the ABC an announcement on the matter would be made in ""coming days"". However, her replacement, Mary-Anne Thomas, has not yet agreed to an interview. In New South Wales, Agriculture Minister Adam Marshall took aim at Mr Littleproud.""It beggars belief that the Federal Agriculture Minister is passing the buck onto the states when what we actually need is national leadership on this issue,"" he said.""The Federal Government continues to sit on its hands saying this is a matter for industry, but they control our international borders and have the ability to authorise travel bubbles — not the states.""Some states have made progress. About 160 seasonal workers flew into Perth from Vanuatu last week.Another flight has been approved to bring a further 158 Pacific Islanders into Western Australia next week, with a third group expected to arrive in March.One of WA's largest table grape growers, Fruitico, has managed to secure 105 workers for their vineyards in Pinjarra, Hamel and Broome.Chief executive Roger Fahl said it was a good start towards filling labour shortages to pick more than 500,000 cartons of grapes — a crop that is shaping up to be the company's largest on record.""It's only about a third of our workforce, so we're still chasing a whole lot of staff, but the seasonal workers do give us nine months of a stable workforce,"" Mr Fahl said.""That's the reality of it at the moment. I don't think any grower in the state will have enough workforce to get all the crops off.""Companies will pick what they can and if there are shortages it will means price rises [for consumers].""In Tasmania, 160 workers from Tonga will be out of hotel quarantine in Hobart next week. They will pick berries around the state, leaving local cherry growers in the lurch.Meanwhile in central Queensland, fears of a major shortage in labour haven't been realised thanks, in part, to backpackers and local students.Franziska Hinze arrived in Australia from Germany just days before Australia shut its borders due to the pandemic.Ms Hinze, who holds a working holiday visa and is travelling with her boyfriend, is now packing mangoes, and says she's planning on staying in Australia to wait out the pandemic for as long as possible.""We're trying to find jobs on farms because, to be honest, it's quite nice to work on a farm, you're just picking and you kind of relax a little bit, especially your mind,"" she said.Adam Farley is an organic zucchini grower near Swan Hill in north-west Victoria.He has been picking them for about a month and has turned off water to two hectares of crops because he will not have staff to pick them. ""The price is down, even weather conditions have hindered us … but labour shortages have been our main issue,"" Mr Farley said.""To make that decision to turn the paddock off, it's just not natural, it doesn't sit well on any level [and] it's heartbreaking.""At the end of the day you have to do it.""","Agricultural Crops, Broome, Crop Harvesting, Farm Labour, Hobart, Kununurra, Mackay, Mildura, Perth, Pinjarra, Swan Hill, Tonga, Trade, Vanuatu, Vegetables, ",2021-01-01 20:22:35+00:00

The 152 Tongan workers who arrived in Emerald on October 29, returned two negative COVID-19 tests throughout their two weeks of on-farm quarantine, which they have now completed. Emerald grape farm manager Douw Van Der Merwe said the business would have lost millions of dollars in rotten fruit if it had not been able to secure employees.""If we didn't have these people, we definitely wouldn't have got this crop off this year — it was very stressful with not a lot of people,"" Mr Van Der Merwe said.""Luckily with the seasonal workers, that have come in with the scheme, we will have enough pickers for the season.""The Emerald charter flight was the first of four due to arrive as part of a Queensland Government trial to help address the state's urgent worker shortage before the season ends.Mr Van Der Merwe said another 50 Tongan workers were due to arrive at the farm next week.Queensland was the first state in Australia to allow farmworkers to work while quarantining. Queensland's Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAF) central region director Stephen Smith said the trial had gone extremely well but was being reviewed before any more flights arrived.""Like everything COVID-19, things can change so we will do a complete review of the process that went on here to make sure it was absolute best practise,"" Mr Smith said.""The entire cohort was completely isolated from the rest of the farm.""They were completely isolated from the packing, they had their own transport and logistics and their own food production.""He said while the other locations for the trial were not confirmed, north Queensland, southern Queensland and an additional flight to Emerald seemed to be the likely options.As part of the scheme, only Federal Government-approved employers could organise charter flights to bring the workers to Australia, which is done at their own cost.The approved employers were responsible for all associated costs, including transport and COVID-19 tests.In Emerald, the costs were shared between a labour hire company and a grape farm with the cohort divided across the two properties.Labour contractor Mel Penson said she was just thankful the Pacific Labour Scheme was restarted. ""I think it was a relief to offer a pilot of a for a very desperate industry that needed some relief,"" she said.""To see that something came off successfully and it can be done and that in the future that this is the model to use than we can continue work.""Farm worker Niukasolo Talanoa said he was grateful to be offered a job to return to Australia for his sixth year.""I decided to come here because I want to make money for my family, pay school fees and also pay rent for the home,"" Mr Talanoa said.""Life is different in Tonga, here we can make money. In Tonga it's hard to make money because there's not much people.""Comparing the past six years, Mr Talanoa said this time was different.""Having quarantine is different, no other people come here to talk like before,"" he said.""When we arrive here we meet together, we share what they have, but this year is different only us coming together from Tonga stay together [and] we can't share.""Stephen Smith of DAF said allowing the workers to quarantine on farm was vital to address the estimated 7,000 farmworker shortage in Queensland.""It does mean that product ends up on Queensland shelves and importantly the Queensland horticulture sectors has workers to pick, prune and pack the product,"" he said.After the workers have finished harvesting grapes in Emerald they will move to other farming areas to help with the harvest.","Agricultural Crops, Crop Harvesting, Emerald, Farm Labour, Fruit, Fruit Crops, Harvesting, Horticulture, Rural, Tonga, ",2020-11-20 00:26:50+00:00

This is despite the fact neighbouring Iran has recorded more than 715,000 coronavirus cases to date and around 40,000 deaths.What's more, the Global Health Security Index, released by John Hopkins University in 2019, ranked Turkmenistan's health system 147th out of 156 countries in terms of preparedness to mitigate the spread of an epidemic.Turkmenistan's COVID-free status is therefore more likely a symptom of the country's repressive policies than the truth.The autocratic President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov — who gained international notoriety last year for doing doughnuts next to a flaming crater to prove he was not dead — has made sure discussion of coronavirus is heavily censored.While there have been more reported deaths from respiratory conditions in 2020 than usual, authorities have blamed dust and air pollution.Access to the country is limited, but World Health Organization (WHO) officials were permitted to travel there in July.""WHO is aware of several sources reporting alleged COVID-19 transmission in the country, and is concerned about reports of increasing acute respiratory infections and pneumonia,"" its report said.Deputy Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Rachel Denber, said in September: ""Turkmenistan's Government has prioritised the country's image over people's wellbeing.""An even more closed-off and totalitarian society than Turkmenistan, North Korea has also reported no cases of COVID-19.This is despite having a 1,420 kilometre border with its ally and closest trade partner China, where the virus was first detected and at least 92,000 cases have been recorded.Neighbouring South Korea has seen more than 27,000 infections.Experts have widely disputed that it's possible the North has no cases whatsoever.North Korea was one of the first countries to shut its borders, barring foreign tourists in January and halting all flights in and out. The Government in February indicated borders would not reopen until a cure was found. It has also mandated masks and restricted public gatherings.In July, it looked as though the North's first case had emerged after somebody crossed the border from South Korea and authorities have repeatedly shut down the border city of Kaesong.But a WHO situation report from North Korea from October 29 said there had been zero cases reported from 10,462 tests conducted — a very low number for a country of more than 25 million.However, some 5,368 people were suspected COVID patients, the WHO said.With their relatively weak healthcare systems, a number of Pacific nations have enforced strict limitations on who is allowed to cross their borders since the pandemic began.As a result, Nauru, Tonga, Kiribati, Micronesia, Palau, Samoa and Tuvalu are the remaining countries not to have reported any COVID cases.The WHO has reported 18,337 cases across the entire Pacific since the pandemic began — fewer than in the state of Victoria.While Pacific nations' geography makes them vulnerable to climate change, it is a unique advantage in a deadly pandemic. Their isolation has made shutting off borders to the rest of the world relatively easy.For example, even after Vanuatu was struck by a major cyclone in April, it did not allow foreign aid workers to disembark for response efforts.Nevertheless, it has taken a toll on their largely tourism-dependent economies.A new report by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) this week warned of an impending food crisis in the Pacific caused by the pandemic.""Food systems were already under pressure. COVID-19 has exposed and exacerbated those pressures,"" said ACIAR CEO Professor Andrew Campbell.""The pandemic is threatening to morph from a health crisis to a food crisis. Women and girls are among the most severely affected groups, and the most at risk from worsening food security.""Australia has boosted its economic support to the region, with the Morrison Government allocating more than $300 million in the Budget to provide economic assistance to recover from the pandemic.The Government pledged a further $500 million late last month to ensure a ""fast, safe vaccine rollout in the Pacific and South-East Asia"".","COVID-19, Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of, Nauru, Pacific, Tonga, Turkmenistan, Vanuatu, ",2020-11-12 02:06:26+00:00

One-third of its workforce was made redundant.In March this year, Virgin Australia pulled out of its plans for a flight training school in Tamworth, citing changed conditions within the industry as a result of the Australian bushfires and coronavirus, with no forecast for increased demand for new cadet pilots.The Tamworth Regional Council commercial director for airport and aviation development, John Sommerlad, says Virgin's decision to cease its Tamworth to Sydney route is not surprising.""It wasn't unexpected in view of the turbulent ride that the Virgin Australia Aviation Group has had in recent time,"" he said.""And also because of the impact the pandemic has had on airlines — not only in Australia but around the world.""Virgin had also offloaded its ATR-72 fleet which were the aircraft that were used for servicing many of its regional Australia routes.

New Zealand first eliminated community transmission of the virus by imposing a strict lockdown in late March when only about 100 people had tested positive for the disease.Some prominent local health experts suggested it was more likely the virus had been quietly spreading in Auckland for weeks, despite efforts to eradicate it with an initial five-week hard lockdown.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the latest outbreak appeared to be a new strain, which may suggest NZ was successful in its first eradication and the virus had now been reintroduced.""The sequence of the virus from the current outbreak is not the same as the sequences from community cases in our first original outbreak in New Zealand.""In other words, not from a dormant community transmission from the beginning of the pandemic.""Since the return of new infections, New Zealand has reimposed tight restrictions and authorities expect case numbers to climb in the coming days.But the country will stick with its initial approach as it tries to drive case numbers back to zero.""Going hard and early is still the best course of action,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.On Friday, she said it was better to look at an outbreak situation with restrictions put in place early.This was in contrast with locations like Hong Kong and Australia.""Better to assess the situation with restrictions in place,"" Ms Ardern said.Mr Bowtell agreed and commended Ms Ardern's plan.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicHe said coronavirus would never be eradicated but eliminating transmission with strict quarantine and isolation measures was the best way to fight the pandemic.""When a case of coronavirus turns up, probably through problems with quarantine and isolation, you move as swiftly as possible and you clobber those cases,"" he said.""Then you go back to cautious business as usual.""He also cautioned against taking an approach more like those seen in the US or Brazil, where economic concerns have prevailed over public health measures.""That would be a recipe for one of the biggest disasters in human history,"" he said.In Australia, there has been substantial opposition to the elimination strategy from both business and government.The Prime Minister has said that level of restrictions would double the unemployment rate and the strategy itself was risky.New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said eradicating the virus in Australia was unrealistic and powerful business groups have argued trying to completely stamp it out was unachievable and would be too destructive to the economy.Mr Bowtell, however, strongly advocates the kinds of measures seen in New Zealand and thinks Australia should follow their goal of eliminating community transmission.""There seemed to be decisions made by the Federal and Victorian governments that they would not learn from and adopt what was going on next door in New Zealand and even closer to home in Queensland and Western Australia,"" he said.""I don't think the strategies adopted by those two governments have worked out very well.""We would have been much better off to have adopted the New Zealand approach in the first place.""In June, NSW, which had been the worst-affected state in Australia before Victoria's second wave, had three weeks without community transmission, and Mr Bowtell said that was a good target to aim for.That could again be achieved by shifting to stricter lockdowns, like in New Zealand.""It's like extinguishing the embers of a bushfire. It's better than waiting until the flames are 10 metres high,"" Mr Bowtell said.""It is better than dealing with hundreds of new cases a day.""","Australia, COVID-19, Diseases and Disorders, Government and Politics, Health, Nauru, New Zealand, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2020-08-15 19:20:26+00:00

How else can we look at these things?""Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicTaumoepeau says a key lesson from Refuge's pandemic was ""that people who are already vulnerable are even more vulnerable in a pandemic — [including] people who live rough on the streets, Indigenous communities, and low-income earners"".""One of the things we didn't realise in Refuge's pandemic [scenario] was that we artists would not be considered in the stimulus packages [in a real pandemic].""Refuge is an extension of Taumoepeau's long-term artistic interrogation of the impact of climate change, which has seen her bind her body to melting ice (i-Land X-isle, 2012) and dance in a tank as it slowly fills with water (Repatriate, 2015).Taumoepeau is a ""Punake"" — a Tongan term she translates as ""a revered, respected composer of music and dance, composition and poetry"" — with training in contemporary dance and different Pacific Islander forms of movement.She began exploring the impact of climate change on the Pacific in 2007, when she learnt about the issue through a campaign run by Sydney's Edmund Rice Centre, as well as a Labor discussion paper called ""Our Drowning Neighbours"".That year, she accompanied delegates from the Pacific Islands to the United Nations Climate Change Conference.""That [trip] really made me rethink what my practice could do,"" Taumoepeau recalls.""I realised that what I had was the autonomy of an artist, and that I could make work and be a voice for those who didn't have a voice.""That includes those living in the Pacific Islands and other low-lying islands and coastal communities, such as the Torres Strait, who are already bearing the brunt of rising sea levels.""It became very important to me to make work that presented the urgency of climate change and said something to connect it to bigger powers, like the mining industry,"" Taumoepeau says.Whether contending with melting ice or rising water in her performances, her aim is to ""create an image that might capture somebody's attention and imagination"".""I see my work as a continuation of what my ancestors did; I'm continuing on in the way they used art to tell stories, to provoke thoughts, ideas and empathy.""In Melbourne for Dance Massive in May last year, Taumoepeau faced a different kind of emergency: a bacterial infection that ""went rogue"", causing meningitis and six embolic strokes.She describes it as ""a near-death experience"".Taumoepeau ended up spending three months in hospital, including a long stint in the intensive care unit, and she had to relearn how to stand and walk.But her artistic practice, which had required her to develop enormous control of her body, helped.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic""I created a whole range of … 'training' [exercises] that are really familiar to me as a trained dancer,"" Taumoepeau recalls.""I created these sessions for myself where … I would feel like I had control of something that I had lost control of.""She listened to dancehall and Hula music, which she says helped her activate and re-articulate each part of her body.""Even if I wasn't physically moving, in my mind I was moving these things,"" Taumoepeau says.""The doctors expected me to recover, but the speed at which I recovered was a bit gobsmacking for them and for me.""Taumoepeau says she was determined to participate in this year's Biennale of Sydney, the first edition of the festival curated by an Indigenous Australian: artist Brook Andrew.""It was so incredible to be a part of his vision, of a First Nations vision … I absolutely struggled to think of letting it go,"" she says.Taumoepeau ended up adapting and reimagining an existing work, Stitching (up) the Sea, as a site-specific performance and installation at Cockatoo Island in Sydney Harbour.As part of this new work, titled The Last Resort, Taumoepeau and her cousin Taliu Aloua (a life-long collaborator) walked over a pile of glass bottles gathered from Sydney nightclubs, using brick sandals and an 'ike (Tongan mallet), to crush the glass.They performed the work several times in the lead-up to, and including, the Biennale's opening weekend.Stacked sacks of empty bottles form an ""imaginary coastline"" of sandbags around the floor of broken glass.Taumoepeau says that by grinding the bottles down to their core material of sand — the material of islands and atolls — she was asking who, a result of rising sea levels, will be forced to do the work of ""reconstructing an island"".""It's vulnerable Indigenous communities — the frontline communities — doing all the heavy lifting around the transformation that needs to happen in order for our planet to survive,"" she says.Taumoepeau is the lead artist of this year's iteration of Refuge, which explores ""displacement as a humanitarian crisis"".But, in March, the coronavirus pandemic put an end to a Melbourne development lab for the project and she had to return to Sydney for lockdown.As she said to her fellow Refuge artists: ""We are no longer in rehearsal, we are doing the real thing right now.""""As an artist, I think this is the perfect time to exercise my imagination and imagine what other future we can create together,"" Taumoepeau says.Whereas an earlier year had seen the Refuge team run a 24-hour simulation of an emergency centre, this year they have adapted to lockdown restrictions with the Refuge Talks Series, Zoom sessions that include practical tips for the pandemic, conversations with artists and experts, and performances.Taumoepeau says artists have an important role to play in countering misinformation around COVID-19.""The mind of an artist looks like 150 tabs on your computer … Sifting through things is very difficult, [and] this is where our innovation as artists comes through."" ""For the sake of understanding and curiosity, we [artists] put ourselves in this state of experimentation, of play, of vulnerability,"" she says.Taumoepeau's experiences of crises — whether they're simulated or personal; specific to the Pacific region or global — have highlighted the importance of forming connections, whether that's between artists and scientists or with family members and friends.""Building relationships with people around you is really important, and that's something you don't have to wait for a pandemic to do,"" she says.Taumoepeau is hoping, through her art practice and the work of Refuge, that people will be able to make another connection: between COVID-19 and climate change.""After the bushfires, it broke through to many that climate change is real; but in the shadow of this pandemic, it's difficult to connect these things,"" she says.""The work, now, is looking at the relationship between what we do and have done and the natural world … This whole thing is connected.""The final Refuge Talks are on at 12.00pm AEST today and June 4.","Arts, Culture and Entertainment, Australia, Climate Change, Contemporary Art, Melbourne, Performing Arts, Sydney, Tonga, ",2020-05-28 00:24:51+00:00

I'm Tongan and I do not relate to that story because it was told through a colonial lens,"" she told the ABC’s Pacific Beat program.""It was bizarre to see a story I’ve been told, told differently and told in a way that didn’t even prioritise the story of the men.""The excerpt published by the Guardian was largely told from the point of view of Peter Warner, the Australian who found the boys, who Mr Bregman tracked down in Queensland, now aged in his 90s.Mr Bregman has defended his account and says he also interviewed two of the boys, now elderly men, for the book.One of those men is 73-year old Sione Filipe Totau, who now lives in Deception Bay, Queensland. He told the ABC he does hope to one day tell the story himself and hopes his grandchildren can help him write it. ""I’d like to write a story by myself from how I feel and how I learned from it and all my experiences,"" he said.""I told them you better write that story while I’m still alive because it could make [them] money and everything in the future.""Mr Totau says he and his five friends decided to run away from school because they were ""bored"".But they drifted at sea for eight days before finally spotting land and once on the island, he says they prayed ""morning and evening to be rescued"". ""[I was] scared, and hungry and freezing, most of the days were rainy and stormy weather,"" Mr Totau said. The story of Mr Totau and his friends has been described by Mr Bregman as ""the real-life Lord of the Flies"" that is ""a tale of friendship and loyalty"", in contrast to William Golding’s famous 1954 novel where a group of British boys, also marooned on a Pacific island after a plane crash, turned to anarchy.Mr Totau told the ABC he and his friends needed to rely on each other to survive.""A group of people … don’t know where they are and don’t have enough food and water … maybe they don’t agree on the same thing, but they have to try to get together and work together and make everything work so they can survive,"" he said.Ms Gesa-Fatafeh believes that’s largely due to their Tongan culture.""When we find other Tongans we stick together; that is very much in our value system and it’s very different to how those fictional boys would have been raised,"" she said.""We were raised to build community and it’s very hard to exist outside of community,"" she told the ABC.  Their Australian rescuer Peter Warner told the ABC he believes there are valuable lessons from the boys’ experience.""It brings out determination, justice, love, compassion. All those things tied together, unites these kids and all of us,"" he said.The story has attracted worldwide attention and Mr Bregman wrote on Twitter he’s been bombarded with emails from producers and directors inquiring about the film rights of the story.  But it has triggered a broader discussion about who owns, and who should tell, indigenous stories.Mr Bregman revealed that the boys’ rescuer had owned and sold the rights of the boys’ rescue to Channel 7.Mr Bregman wrote that Mr Warner had negotiated that in order to release the boys from prison, because they’d been charged for stealing the boat, that ended up capsizing.While Mr Totau said he has no issue with Mr Warner owning the rights, he does want to discuss with the surviving members of the six friends how best they can navigate this new-found attention. ""Some people are blaming him [Mr Warner] because he is making money off of us,"" he said.""To those people I say shut up and forget about it.""He is the one who rescued us. If he [didn’t] do that, there is no way for us to come out from the island.""But Ms Gesa-Fatafehi disagreed.""For me it’s so hard to process because 'whiteness' believes it can own anything and everything,"" she said. ""They essentially don’t own the rights to their own life story and that's very upsetting.""The New Zealand Oscar-winning director Taika Waititi has weighed in on the conversation, writing on Twitter that in his opinion, ""you should prioritise Polynesian (Tongan if possible!) filmmakers as to avoid cultural appropriation, misrepresentation, and to keep the Pasifika voice authentic"".Ms Gesa-Fatafehi agrees that if the story is made into a film, she would like to see Tongans behind, and in front of, the camera. ""I think it should be a Tongan team behind it all — a Tongan director, a Tongan scriptwriter, a Tongan cast and it has to be told in Tongan,"" Ms Gesa-Fatefehi said.""If this movie was to come to life for the six men, then their story should be told how they want it; it should benefit them and their families, because it is something they experienced.

Local disaster teams in Vanuatu hope to reach some of the worst-affected areas today.Glen Craig from the Vanuatu Business Resilience Council estimates up to 90 per cent of homes in the country's second largest town, Luganville, have been damaged.""It's worse than what we thought,"" he said.""People here are positive. I think they're still a bit shell-shocked at the moment but they know that help is coming but help will need to come fast.""Hopefully Australia and New Zealand military, especially, can start to mobilise — the airfield's fine for landing heavy aircraft.""Aid groups predict Vanuatu's recovery could take more than 12 months.The ABC has been told the situation is ""grim"", with fears the damage in some places has been worse than Cyclone Pam, which hit Vanuatu in March 2015, killing at least 15 people and leaving the country with a damage bill of nearly $600 million — more than half of the country's annual GDP.Kendra Gates Derousseau, the country director at World Vision in Vanuatu, told the ABC damage she had seen in Luganville and video of Pentecost Island, ""indicate that the damage is significantly worse than tropical Cyclone Pam"".""The body of Harold was smaller than Pam, so the damage is less expansive in terms of numbers of islands, but the islands that were hit — it almost looked like a tornado had ripped through Luganville,"" she said.""Instead of things being wind-blown and toppled, they were literally torn to pieces."" The ADF will deliver relief supplies such as blankets, lanterns, shelter and hygiene kits. Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said the assistance for Vanuatu was ""part of our commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder during times of crisis.""Foreign Minister Marise Payne said there would likely be more assistance announced in the coming days.""We are acutely conscious that this comes on top of the impact and difficulties created by COVID-19 for those countries and so our support is all the more important,"" Senator Payne said.New Zealand announced on Wednesday it would provide $480,000 to Vanuatu to help rebuild after the cyclone.According to Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office, however, ""no foreign personnel are being brought to Vanuatu for response efforts at the present time"".""This will be an internally run operation,"" it said.Any crew unloading supplies would wear protective gear and remain on the runway, authorities said.The cyclone, with wind gusts of up to 285 kilometres per hour near its centre, severely damaged tourist resorts in Tonga yesterday.Local police reported three tourist resorts north of the capital, Nukualofa, had been virtually flattened.Damage caused by Harold in Fiji, meanwhile, was worse than anticipated, the Red Cross told the ABC.Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said the country was ""hit hard"" but that he was ""still waiting for the full damage report"". Flooding caused by the cyclone continues to affect much of the country.A tornado flipped the roof off a local college, Mr Bainimarama said in a message posted to Twitter.""We've been through many cyclones before, even stronger than Harold. We always bounce back.""At least 27 people were killed in the Solomon Islands during the storm after they were swept off a ferry.Australia has already provided support to the Solomon Islands and has offered assistance to Fiji and Tonga.""We stand ready to provide further help to our Pacific family in whatever ways we can,"" Senator Payne said.""It will be some time before the full impact of this disaster is known.""Pacific nations have implemented measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, despite having relatively few reported cases.While Vanuatu has not confirmed any cases of COVID-19, there are concerns the relief effort could compromise the vulnerable nation. ""Foreign-donated humanitarian supplies, which have initially come from our partners from Australia, New Zealand and France, are being handled to strict health protocols to negate any risk of COVID-19 coming to Vanuatu,"" a statement said.Ms Gates Derousseau said Vanuatu had no intensive care beds and that if coronavirus hit, ""it would have the potential to devastate the population"".Pacific Islands Forum leaders on Wednesday agreed to establish a Pacific Humanitarian Pathway on COVID-19, which it said would allow for assistance to be expedited and distributed equitably among member countries.Tuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano, chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, said coronavirus ""poses a real and extreme danger to the health and security of the Pacific peoples"".""Never before has the full forum membership simultaneously been in crisis.""The European Union, meanwhile, announced 119 million euros ($205 million) to assist Pacific nations to strengthen their health, water and sanitation systems in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus.''The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest global challenge of our time,"" EU ambassador for the Pacific, H.E.

The cyclone, with wind gusts of up to 285 kilometres per hour near its centre, passed by the south of Tonga this morning (local time).The Tongan Meteorological Service has issued warnings for the Tongatapu and 'Eua island groups with expectations of hurricane-force winds of up to 117kph.There are also warnings of gale force and strong winds for the Ha'apai, Tele-ki-Tonga and Tele-ki-Tokelau island groups and Vava'u, Niuatoputapu and Niuafo'ou islands.The meteorological service said it expected a damaging ocean swell to batter all of Tonga as the storm moves south-east.Tongan National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) has advised people to stay away from coastal areas and avoid sea travel until the storm passes. It is forecast to move out of Tongan waters and downgrade to a category three storm by 7:00pm (local time).In Vanuatu, the devastation is widespread.  Power and water supplies are still down and the majority of homes have been damaged in some way, leaving many homeless.Christina Boelulvanua and her family were among the thousands of people who fled volcanic eruptions on Vanuatu's Ambae island back in 2018.But the tropical cyclone has smashed her new life to pieces.""It's so depressing for me and the family. I ran away from the volcano with my kids thinking 2020 would be safe but then came Cyclone Harold,"" she said.Ms Boelulvanua lives in Banban, a community set up for volcano evacuees in the island of Santo.Nearly everything in Banban has been flattened by Harold's winds. Every house has been damaged and food gardens are wiped out.""Now it's all gone. All the bananas are down, yams are down. So it will take time before we start all over again,"" she said.Like many in Vanuatu, Ms Boelulvanua depends on her garden to feed her family.She told the ABC her family would eat the scraps the cyclone has left them, but she doesn't know what they'll do once it's finished.""Some people who have paid jobs can still survive from buying food from the shop, but [for] others who depend on food crops, I can't see how they can survive,"" she said.Fiji has begun assesses the damage left by Harold, which moved out of the country's waters overnight.Images and vision have emerged showing widespread flooding on the main island Viti Levu.Residents have also reported that roofs were ripped off buildings and roads blocked by fallen trees.  Fiji Red Cross director general Ilisapeci Rokotunidau told the ABC's Pacific Beat program the initial damage from the cyclone was far more severe than anticipated.  ""We didn't predict the amount of saturation there was on land. The floods came up quite quickly and into areas we didn't anticipate,"" Ms Rokotunidau said. Naziah Ali, who lives in the town of Ba — located in the north-west of Viti Levu — told Pacific Beat her town was engulfed. ""The town is flooded, most of the shops that you see open on a Wednesday have been closed and boarded up,"" she said.""I can already envisage how much damage there's going to be to goods and other materials people have in their shops.""She added that she saw widespread crop damage to nearby farms and sugar cane fields. The damage from Harold has made Fiji's management of coronavirus more complex. The country has 15 confirmed cases.""We are doing all of this amid COVID-19 restrictions, so a lot of the [country's] movement has been restricted,"" Ms Rokotunidau said. ""One of the things we have stressed to our volunteers is their own personal safety as they prepare to [help families]."" She said she hoped the Australian Red Cross would donate personal protective equipment (PPE) to Fiji's Red Cross volunteers as they assist in the recovery effort amid COVID-19.The Australian Government has provided the Solomon Islands with more than $99,000 of emergency assistance funds, while New Zealand has also joined Australia in providing more than $480,000 in financial assistance to Vanuatu.A defence jet will leave Australia later today to deliver cyclone relief supplies to Vanuatu. Australia has also confirmed an offer to Fiji of damage surveillance and humanitarian relief supplies.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne told a press conference this morning that officials were ""assessing"" what immediate impact Cyclone Harold was having on Tonga. ""We stand ready to provide what further help we can to our Pacific family in whatever ways we can,"" she said.Australia is working with the Red Cross and other NGOs to provide supplies like tents and water containers in Vanuatu.It is also helping with damage-assessment flights.The ABC has been told the situation is ""grim"" with fears the damage in some places has been as bad as Cyclone Pam, which hit Vanuatu in March 2015, killing at least 15 people and leaving the country with a damage bill of nearly $600 million, more than half of the country's annual GDP.The Australian High Commissioner to Vanuatu was aboard one of the damage-assessment flights and she was joined by the Vanuatu country director for the NGO World Vision, Kendra Gates Derousseau.""Houses were essentially pulled to pieces rather than just wind damage. It was catastrophic,"" Ms Gates told the ABC's Pacific Beat.Ms Gates Derousseau said that eight of her staff ""had lost everything"", including one pregnant staff member who had to run for cover with her family. ""[She] described [being] in the middle of the cyclone, having to take her two young children by the hands and run about 100 metres to another house because a large tree had fallen on her house,"" she said. With the double-whammy of managing coronavirus mitigation and cyclone recovery, Ms Gates Derousseau said Vanuatu's full recovery would take years, and would need international help. ""Given the COVID-19 crisis, I would anticipate that at least the economy will take many years to start again, particularly because Santo [Island] was a massive tourist destination,"" she said. ""The north of the island is also the big agricultural centre. So there will be significant damages sustained because of the loss of crops and the loss of the ability to both internally and externally export.""[But] the Vanuatu people are proving themselves resilient, [and] they will need international assistance to continue with that journey.""

Mr Freshney said the council had not been consulted when the worker program permit was approved, yet it was expected to deal with the fallout.""The flaw, I believe, in the policy, is the approved employer makes the declaration that the properties are compliant, but there are no checks and balances in the process where local government can confirm that is the case,"" he said.""That is something we'd like to see changed, that's for sure.""The National Farmers' Federation said it was the responsibility of ""all stakeholders involved in the employment of farm workers to, as far as possible, satisfy themselves that workers are being treated in a way that is lawful and ethical"".""Farmers continually report that a lack of housing in regional towns and villages for seasonal and itinerant workers hinders their ability to attract workers,"" NFF chief executive Tony Mahar said.Opposition spokesman Brendan O'Connor called on Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Senator Cash to investigate workers' living conditions.""The Government needs to explain what measures they are putting in place to ensure other workers on the program are safe,"" he said.Meanwhile, Greens agriculture spokeswoman Janet Rice said it was hard to know if this was an isolated incident.""The fact it keeps happening is a real worry, and the problem is it tars everybody with the one brush,"" Senator Rice said.The department spokesperson said the Government had zero tolerance for the exploitation of workers.Wages earned by Tongans on the Seasonal Worker Program now exceed the total value of Australian aid sent to Tonga and Tongan exports to Australia combined.Sione Vaka from Tonga's Ministry of Internal Affairs, who is a liaison officer with the program, told the ABC he had visited the Shearwater property.""I am confused about the news saying 70 people in five bedrooms — that is not true ... the house was renovated to accommodate 17 people and it was approved from the department,"" he said.""There are three separate houses; one main building and two small houses on the side.""Mr Vaka said the workers had not complained about the conditions and the matter ""was between the landlord and the council"".The workers were surprised to be moved from the house, he added.

Vasiti Soko, director of Fiji's National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), told reporters on Saturday that an 18-year-old student drowned after being swept away by strong currents while swimming in waters on the southern island of Kadavu. In an NDMO update at 5:30pm Sunday (local time),  Ms Soko confirmed that the body of a man in his 40s was found by villagers in Naitasiri province, on Fiji's main island Viti Levu.A tweet from the office also confirmed that a 15-year-old boy, who was hospitalised in a critical condition after being reportedly being struck by a falling roof, ""is recovering well"" at the Colonial War Memorial Hospital in Suva. The last update from the NDMO said 2,001 people were in 54 evacuation centres across the country. The cyclone did not make landfall as it moved south-eastward around Viti Levu, but its proximity to Fiji sent strong winds and rain hurling across the Pacific nation. In the south, islands such as Kadavu, Vatulete and Matuku were met with winds with average speeds of up to 110 kilometres per hour, with momentary gusts of 150 kph, according to the Fiji Meteorological Service. The NDMO's last update said there was damage to Kavadu, but it was not able to confirm the full extent as its officers were in the process of gathering information. As of Sunday evening, the cyclone has moved past the majority of Fiji's islands, with its centre forecast to be 70km north-west of Ono-i-Lau in the country's south-east by Monday morning (local time). The Met Service continues to update local conditions across Fiji via its Facebook page. Tropical Cyclone Sarai is expected to leave Fiji's area of responsibility by New Year's Day, moving into Tongan waters on Wednesday.The last forecast map from Tonga's Meteorological Service predicts Sarai move between the kingdom's northern Vava'u and Ha'aapi island groups by Thursday morning.The service has issued a tropical cyclone alert which carries a strong wind, rain and flash flood alert for all Tongan land areas.Meteorologist Neville Koop, who is based in Fiji's capital Suva, told the ABC on Saturday that the Fijian islands remaining in the cyclone's path were much more vulnerable to disasters because of their remoteness.""They're much more difficult for us to access and to take supplies and assistance to if they get severely affected …,"" Mr Koop said.However, officials such as the Red Cross's Ellie van Baaren told the ABC that many Fijians were well prepared. ""There's a huge amount of information that was delivered before Sarai [was] named as a cyclone,"" she said. ""People knew that it was heading this way that it could potentially be a cyclone. And about 2,000 people … were reported to be in evacuation centres as a precautionary measure."" On Sunday Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama met with cyclone evacuees at a primary school north-east of Suva in Vunivivi.  The PM also toured damaged homes and was briefed by local health officials on the situation. A post from the Fijian Government Facebook page reported that residents were informed that the Government was ""looking into"" cyclone assistance. The NDMO's Ms Soko said those remaining in the centres are due to receive food rations. Medical teams also continued to carry out measles vaccinations. As the cyclone moved across Fiji, numerous roads and crossings were flooded or blocked as a result of fallen trees. Ms Soko urged people to avoid driving through flooded roads of unknown depths, as some may continue to be hazardous with strong currents. Videos and images posted on social media of the cyclone's effects showed seawater inundation to coastal areas, along with various flooding events due to heavy rainfall. The Fiji Times also reported that a vehicle convoy carrying six people and a cow was washed away in floodwaters.Several flights, ferry and bus services were also cancelled as the cyclone moved across the islands. By Sunday, most of Fiji Airways and Fiji Link flights were restored except for services to and from Kavadu Island. ","Cyclone, Cyclones, Fiji, Pacific, Storms, Tonga, ",2019-12-28 05:29:52+00:00
174,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-19/how-did-a-measles-outbreak-become-deadly-in-samoa/11713644,"Samoa's Government has announced a compulsory mass vaccination campaign, making receiving immunisations a mandatory legal requirement.The move comes amid a deadly measles outbreak in the nation.Officials said there has been 15 confirmed deaths as a result of the measles crisis, with most of the victims children under the age of two.Last Friday, the Samoan Government declared a 30-day state of emergency in response to the crisis. All schools were ordered to close, and restrictions were placed on the movement of vulnerable people in order to curb the spread of the disease.But experts said the outbreak was entirely predictable given the country's low vaccination rate, as well as a range of other factors that helped trigger the emergency.Here's what you need to know.The outbreak is believed to have started in New Zealand, where there have been 2,060 confirmed cases of measles just this year, before spreading to Samoa and other nations across the region — including Australia.It's believed the New Zealand outbreak, which is largely centred on the Auckland region, may have started due to historically low immunisation rates, creating gaps in vaccine coverage.In Samoa, approximately two-thirds of the population has been immunised in the island state with a population of just 200,000.That low immunisation coverage rate has been attributed as the main reason for the deaths seen in Samoa, according to the country's Ministry of Health.Other nations like Fiji, Tonga and American Samoa, which have higher coverage, have not reported any measles-related deaths despite being in a similar ""measles epidemic mode"", the ministry said.However other factors contributed to low vaccination rates in more recent times.Last year, two Samoan nurses incorrectly mixed and administered a routine mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccination, leading to two infant deaths.In the immediate aftermath of the deaths, Samoa's Government recalled all MMR vaccines, and placed a temporary ban on administering them.Experts believe the incident may have further deterred parents in the country from giving their children the injections.Samoan media have reported more than 700 suspected cases of measles, with 48 of those confirmed as measles cases.Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that spreads easily through breathing, coughing and sneezing. It typically causes a rash, fever and white spots in the mouth.More serious complications include blindness, pneumonia, brain damage and severe dehydration.The Samoan Government has ordered children under the age of 17 to not attend public gatherings, in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading.""The way it is going now and the poor [immunisation] coverage, we are anticipating the worst to come,"" Samoa's director-general of Health, Leausa Take Naseri, told a press conference this week.Meanwhile, officials have also moved to make receiving vaccinations a legal requirement, as part of a mass immunisation campaign.Children aged six months to 19 years old are to be prioritised, as well as non-pregnant women between 20 and 35.Measles cases are rising globally, including in wealthy nations such as the United States and Germany, where some parents shun vaccines for philosophical or religious reasons, or concerns — debunked by medical science — that the vaccine can cause autism.Western Australia is currently going through one of its worst measles outbreaks in years, which, like the outbreak in Samoa, is also believed to have been triggered by a New Zealand traveller.Queensland has also recorded 24 cases on Brisbane's southside, Logan and Redland Coast areas.In Tonga, all government primary schools and kindergartens have been shut until at least November 25, in an effort to limit the spread of measles sweeping through the South Pacific.American Samoa, which lies to the southeast of Samoa, has also announced a public health emergency over a measles outbreak.Governor Lolo Matalasi Moliga said everyone travelling from Tonga and Samoa to the US territory must provide proof of measles immunisation as a condition of entry.Samoa Airways chief executive Tupuivao Seiuli said it was vital all visitors travelling to American Samoa through Samoa comply with the new conditions, in order to reduce further disruption to their travel plans and assist neighbouring countries.Australia has sent a team of 34 doctors and nurses to provide assistance to clinical staff at Samoa's main hospital in the capital Apia.They've also established a temporary eight-bed emergency intensive care unit, and a negative-pressure facility to treat and isolate patients suffering from the worst case of the outbreak.New Zealand's Foreign Minister has also pledged to send more than 3,000 vaccines and 30 nurses to Samoa to assist.UNICEF's Sheldon Yett told the ABC the UN agency had already provided more than 110,000 doses of vaccine, and was ready to send additional doses if required.""Unfortunately the number of deaths keep climbing and the number of cases keep climbing,"" he said.""I'm confident that with all parties working together, we'll soon get this under control, but right now we do have an emergency situation.""","American Samoa, Australia, Disaster Relief, Fiji, Health, Infant Health, Infectious Diseases (Other), New Zealand, Pacific, Samoa, Tonga, Vaccines and Immunity, World Politics, ",2019-11-18 23:35:20+00:00

But that's before living costs, police checks, insurances and a multitude of factors that come into play.While some workers have positive experiences, others find themselves in industries rife with reports of exploitation, human trafficking and wage theft.Both schemes are positioned as development aid for the Pacific region, a ""win-win-win"" according to Lowy Institute's Jonathan Pryke.But Vea questions whether Pacific countries are the real beneficiaries.""Seasonal workers are part of our everyday landscapes yet unrecognised or hidden,"" the artist said.This desire to shed light on an invisible workforce and population is informed by Vea's relatives who have participated in the RSE scheme.In emulating information booths found in Pacific nations to recruit migrant workers for the RSE scheme, Vea's simple but direct artwork offers a confronting depiction of how Australia and New Zealand are perceived by Pacific Islanders.""[I'm] just sharing a perspective on what it looks like from the other side,"" says Vea.From ages two to four, Vea would tag along with his father at the Fletcher Fisheries factory in Auckland, and sometimes his mother too, at the hospital where she worked as a registered nurse.""We couldn't afford preschool, kindergarten, or babysitters,"" he says.Vea currently works at a potato chip factory — while also completing his PhD — as a way to earn a living and also collect the experiences and struggles of migrants by way of talanoa — a research methodology in the Pacific academic world.Tongan academic Timote M. Vaioleti describes talanoa as ""a personal encounter where people story their issues, their realities and aspirations"".""Talanoa is a word for conversation throughout Fiji, Samoa and Tonga,"" Vea says.""The people I talanoa with are from the community I come from, which is a lower socio-economic community, Pacific migrants and other migrants that have relocated to New Zealand,"" he says.For Vea, the exchanging of words and movements through the act of talanoa is what informs his art practice.""I reflect those ideas and stories as a Tongan living in Aotearoa.""Vea opened his first Australian solo exhibition in October, also titled If I pick your fruit, will you put mine back? at Sydney gallery 4A.The exhibition features four video works, a ""seasonal worker survival kit"" and a participatory installation that recreates the lunch room at the Bluebird potato chip factory Vea used to work at too.The title of the exhibition and performance was settled on long before Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack's ""pick our fruit"" comments at the Pacific Islands Forum in August this year.""It was serendipitous,"" Vea says with a chuckle.""It just confirmed the ignorance and the lack of empathy, understanding and caring of what [Pacific] countries are facing [with climate change].""On the first floor of 4A, a pile of cinder blocks forms the beginnings of a wall; projected onto it is Vea's 2013 video artwork 29.09.2009 Tribute to Samoa, American Samoa and Tonga. In the work, a focused but visibly anxious Vea attempts to construct a wall on a beach while the tide washes in and swirls around him.Vea says that for those who live in Pacific nations, the evidence of rising sea levels is an urgent lived reality.""You just got to go out the front door to see [water] coming on to the roads,"" he said.He reflects that perhaps Mr McCormack's remarks stem from a Western system of thinking focused on the individual.""In the Pacific, we grow up as a collective.

In 2005, the haka Kapa O Pango debuted before the Tri-Nations test match between New Zealand and South Africa in Dunedin, New Zealand. The composer of Kapa O Pango, Derek Lardelli, said this haka was designed to reflect the multicultural make-up of contemporary New Zealand, and in particular, the influence of Polynesian cultures like Samoa and Tonga as well as European cultures. Unlike the haka Ka Mate, Kapa O Pango is a ceremonial cry as opposed to a war dance.""Kapa O Pango is fundamentally what we call haka Taparahi, which is ceremonial and about building your spiritual, physical and intellectual capacity before doing something important,"" Lardelli told All Blacks media. Shortly after its debut, it received criticism for being violent, largely due to the action at the end, which had been described as a throat-cutting motion.There were even calls to ban it from the game. However, according to Lardelli the gesture is not a threat, and instead symbolises the hā — the breath of life — and using it to energise the body ahead of the game. ""When the players get to that stage of the haka, their legs are burning and they're gasping for air,"" Lardelli said.""The action is actually to grab a hold of the energy that exists [in] the left [of the body] and hauling it through the vital organs — heart, lungs, air passages — so that you've revitalised yourself for the game,"" Lardelli said.Kapa O Pango sits alongside Ka Mate and is performed at the team's discretion. The national rugby team of Samoa, the Manu Samoa, perform the Siva Tau.It was composed for the 1991 Rugby World Cup and replaced the Ma'ulu'ulu Moa, which was a slower dance and said to be less intimidating to the opposition. Former Manu Samoa halfback Tino Junior Poluleuligaga told the ABC the Siva Tau is an invitation to war.""When we perform the Siva Tau we are basically saying who we are, we're prepared for battle, and that there is no one else like the Manu Samoa,"" he said.""When I do the Siva Tau I reflect and think about my family, I'm representing them, so when I go out on the field, I go to battle for my family.""It definitely gets you up and gets you excited.""There are also rules when it comes to performing war dances before a Test match.""Both teams have to stand behind the 10-metre line and are not allowed to advance beyond that line,"" Poluleuligaga explained.However, he said if both teams have a war dance, then usually the away team performs their war dance first, followed by the home team.""It's totally up to the opposition to decide how they will respond to the war dance and most teams just bind up and face it front on,"" he said.""I have seen teams from other nations turn their back on it and some people say that's a sign of disrespect, but it's basically up to the team to decide what they want to do.""Former captain of Tonga's rugby team Inoke Afeaki was there when the Sipi Tau was first performed at the 1995 World Cup in South Africa. The Sipi Tau was composed by King Tama Tu'i Tufahau Tupou IV in 1994, but its origins can be traced back much further.""It was quite a lengthy dance when we first started off, it took over 2 minutes to perform,"" Afeaki told the ABC.""It's now a shorter version but it's still pretty ferocious for the 30 seconds we put it on.""Afeaki said performing the Sipi Tau evoked for him the spirit of Tonga's warrior ancestors.""It does prepare you for the amount of contact you're going to get yourself into and, it's also the last warning to the opposing team that it's going to be a tough day in the office,"" Afeaki said.There have been complaints questioning the performance of cultural war dances before a game, with critics saying they give a team an unfair advantage over the opposition, especially when the opposing team doesn't perform a war dance of their own. But Afeaki said they are part of the appeal of the game. ""War dances are something special that have become part of the culture of the game and it's why a lot of people tune in to watch it at the start of the game,"" he said.""If people still love it and it's relevant, then they should keep doing them because these dances are obviously appealing to the fanbase.""The Cibi (pronounced thim-bi) is the war dance the national team of Fiji performs before every Test match. It was prepared in 1939 for Fiji's first-ever tour of New Zealand because the Fijian captain, Sir George Cakobau, wanted a war dance to match the All Blacks' haka Ka Mate.It must have worked because Sir George's team went on to become the only team to remain unbeaten on a full tour to New Zealand.Former captain of the Flying Fijians, Sale Sorovaki, grew up performing the Cibi. ""It's one of those things that you see as a little boy and you imitate it at home or with your friends, but when you actually perform it on the world stage the feeling is surreal,"" Sorovaki told ABC.""When you perform the Cibi, you are telling the opposition that whatever you throw at me, I'm going to be ready for it and I'm going to build this wall to stop you.""However, Sorovaki said he wasn't sure whether the Cibi caused the opposition to be intimated. ""I couldn't really tell whether the opposition was intimidated or not, but the Cibi is part of our rugby history, our culture and our identity.""It showcases our culture — who we are — and I think it's a great thing to have in sport.""In 2012, Fiji introduced the Bole, believing it to be more fitting as both a more rousing war cry and the ""acceptance of challenge"". However, the national team decided to go back to the Cibi after the 2012 Pacific Nations Rugby Cup. While Australia doesn't have a war dance, the rugby team did perform a cultural dance back in 1908, according to the Australian Rugby Union website.Again, not wanting to be bettered by the All Blacks' haka Ka Mate, the Australian team performed an Indigenous song and dance during their England tour. However, then-Wallabies captain Herbert Moran thought it was a sham.In his autobiography, Viewless Winds, he wrote: ""I refused to lead the wretched caricature of a native corroboree, and regularly hid myself among the team, a conscientious objector.""In 1999, Australian singer John Williamson led the crowd in Waltzing Matilda as a reply to the haka before kick-off at home Tests. And in 2003, the Australian Rugby Union made a formal request to the International Rugby Board (IRB) for Waltzing Matilda to be sung at the 2003 World Cup, but it was ruled that only a country's national anthem could be sung and exceptions would only be made for performances deemed of cultural significance.","Dance, Fiji, Music (Arts and Entertainment), New Zealand, Pacific, Rugby Union, Samoa, Sport, Tonga, ",2019-08-31 18:53:57+00:00

Coinciding with social media, this has given gender diverse communities around the globe a chance to reframe stories that have often been beset by negative colonial portraits.Tahiti's pre-colonial expressions of gender diversity for example — known as māhū — prompted one English missionary to label the island the ""filthy Sodom of the South Seas"" in 1827. But the Pacific is a region that has long hosted alternative expressions of gender, and this current cultural moment has given its peoples a chance to contribute to a global conversation. ""In Samoan and other neighbouring cultures, people who have non-heteronormative lifestyles are not considered minorities,"" Léuli Eshragi, a Samoan-Iranian artist and curator, told the ABC.""Everybody has a role and it doesn't really matter who you sleep with — the most important thing is how you contribute to the community,"" Dr Eshragi said. Tahiti is not the only place home to māhū, as Hawaii is also home to them.In Samoa, people assigned male at birth who live as women are known as fa'afafine, which literally translates to ""in the fashion of a woman"".Similar identities to fa'afafine are found in Tonga (fakaleitī or leitī), Fiji (vaka sa lewa lewa), Niue (fakafifine), Kiribati and Tuvalu (pinapinaaine), the Cook Islands (akava'ine) and New Zealand (whakawāhine). For Samoans assigned female at birth who live as men, they are known as fa'afatama, as fakatangata in Tonga, and as tanata ira tane among New Zealand's Māori population, though these people feature less prominently across the region. Over the decades, there has been wide debate about how and exactly when these identities first emerged in the region, pitted between those who believe they are pre-colonial identities, and those who view them as post-contact phenomena. ""There is absolutely no evidence of the presence of [people like] leitīs in any Pacific culture other than Tahiti and possibly Hawaii,"" Professor Niko Besnier, a professor of cultural anthropology who specialises in the Pacific at the University of Amsterdam, told the ABC. But he also pointed to his 1994 paper discussing the Pacific's gender diversity, where he explained the absence of these people within European records did not necessarily mean they were not there to begin with.  ""Little can be inferred from historical silence.""Dr Eshragi told the ABC that the lack of historical documentation brought up the question of whether pre-contact cultures ""needed to say who was cis-gender and who was trans"". ""There wasn't such a barrier between people,"" he said. It's important to note that some Pacific Islanders and those of the global diaspora who exhibit gender diversity do not see themselves as transgender, however others do. Kalissa Alexeyeff, a specialist in the Pacific's sexualities and gender identities at the University of Melbourne, told the ABC that a number of misconceptions of the Pacific's gender diverse peoples still linger among Western observers. She drew attention to the assumption that some akava'ine or fa'afafine were simply the product of families raising boys as girls in lieu of producing children assigned female at birth. ""To me that's the biggest load of bullshit,"" Dr Alexeyeff said. She added that the Pacific's gender diverse populations do not constitute a ""third gender"" as it has sometimes been reported, but more so represent a ""spectrum of expression and identity"".""Some fakaleitī, fa'afafine and akava'ine would consider themselves women, but others would consider themselves trans, or both,"" she said.But Professor Besnier explained that across the Pacific, there is increasing pressure to fit into Western LGBT categorisations. ""The problem is [Western] labels come with resources,"" he said.""There are some who have managed to tap into outside funding [by] embracing the label LGBT because it enables them to present themselves to the rest of the world."" Amao Leota Lu, a Melbourne-based fa'afafine performer and activist, told the ABC that this pressure is compounded for those within the Pacific diaspora in the West, where the literacy of identities such as fa'afafine isn't as high, even among LGBT communities. ""What I find [in Australia] is we still try to find an identity or a box to fit in, and mentally it can be quite challenging,"" she said. ""When I look at my Samoan counterparts … the feelings are a bit more relaxed, they don't have to conform to a 'box'.""But despite the troubles of cross-cultural translation, Dr Alexeyeff said that greater cross-pollination between the Pacific and the West allowed the region's gender diverse peoples to broadcast their story to the world. ""People are saying [they're becoming] more Western, but I think [they're] actually creating more forms of cultural production and new identities that aren't necessarily Western,"" she said.In New Zealand, for example, community activist and worker Phylesha Brown-Acton coined the term MVPFAFF (mahu, vakasalewalewa, palopa, fa'afafine, akava'ine, fakaleiti or leiti, and fakafifine) to enhance Pasifika gender diversity awareness in addition to the term LGBTQI. At a first glance, it may appear as though sexuality and gender diversity in the Pacific does not appear as fraught as it is in some Western countries. Samoa's Prime Minister Susuga Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi is patron of the Samoa Fa'afafine Association, and Tonga's fakaleitī have supporters in the Royal court.Professor Besnier said that even the Pacific's older Christian denominations — such as the Catholic, Anglican or Methodist churches — had no issues with leitīs. But despite this, Professor Besnier said that life as a gender diverse person in the Pacific begins with ""a big minus"". ""There is this [stereotype] of acceptance and respect, that leitīs are intensely respected, which is not true,"" he said. Dr Alexeyeff added that the region's pedestaling of hyper-femininity cloaked the discrimination akava'ine or fa'afafine face when acting upon sexual desire.""People love the whole show — the glam drag queens and performing,"" she said.""But some of the people I've spoken to said if they were caught having sex with a man, that's when they would get bashed by family members."" Ms Lu also spoke of the discrete discrimination that exists underneath countries such as Tonga and Samoa's tacit acceptance of these people.""In Samoa, people need to get their head around the fact that fa'afafine can do anything — it's great that they hold government positions, but we still sit at the bottom of the ladder."" But, in spite of this context, Ms Lu added that there's never been a better time than now to advocate for the Pacific's gender diversity. ""We're seeing more stories coming out on social media — there needs a lot more, but it's just great when we've got our women of colour in the US that have got that narrative going for us,"" she said.""What I say to Pacific people from the LGBTIQ [community]: Question everything, allow for your voice to be heard, get out there and be proactive and tell your stories.""

""At the start of it I couldn't even stay on the kayak — so we had to learn very quickly."" The championships are being held in Szeged, Hungary, and Taufatofua's K1 200-metre heat had a minor hitch. At the starting blocks, Taufatofua struggled to keep his kayak facing forward in strong winds, and eventually had to make a 360-degree turn while his competitors waited for him to get back into position. ""I hit the starting block and the will in the current swung around,"" Taufatofua said. ""We'd only learnt to start on a certain side, and I hadn't learnt the skills to stabilise myself under those conditions — so I went back around and kept my composure."" Taufatofua failed to qualify as he finished last, clocking in at 58.19 — 24.22 seconds behind heat-winner Strahinja Stefanovic of Serbia.To compete at Tokyo's Olympic kayak race, he must record the fastest time in his heat at the 2020 Canoe Sprint Oceania Championships in February, otherwise he may receive a place via a special 'tripartite' invitation.This invitation would be decided by the International Olympic Committee, National Olympic Committees, and the International Canoeing Federation based on previous results and whether or not the invitee fits the Olympic principle of universal representation.Taufatofua said the championships were the first time he had ever faced a sprint kayaking starting block. ""We hadn't actually trained in them — I guess it was a comedy of errors,"" he said. But while it may have appeared to be an unconventional start in the sport, it hasn't weakened Taufatofua's resolve to make Olympic history. ""I want to be the first to compete in three unrelated sports — the goal is still there and it's only just started,"" he said. ""I'm not worried about criticism, and I guess that gives me the freedom to try."" When he returns to Tonga, Taufatofua will also be trying to qualify for taekwondo in the Olympics, which may see him compete in two separate Olympic sports in Tokyo if successful. ""It's always about trying to reach that next level,"" he said.","Canoeing and Kayaking, Climate Change, European Union, Hungary, Japan, Pacific, Sport, Sports Organisations, Summer Olympic Games, Tonga, Winter Olympic Games, ",2019-08-23 03:55:13+00:00
187,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-16/pacific-women-supported-by-millions-of-donated-bras/11412234,"Every night after Maylalani Maafu gets home from work, she washes the one bra she owns, hoping it will dry for the next day.Her job as a customs broker on the Vava'u islands in Tonga pays her 25 Pa'anga ($16) a day, one dollar less than the cost of a mid-range bra. ""Maybe I'll just buy one [bra] for the year … If I buy two I can't feed my kids,"" Ms Maafu said. It's a plight that affects many women across the Pacific. Well-made bras are usually too expensive and women often have to travel from remote villages into cities if they want to buy one.Even when bras are available, they are often imported from China and are sometimes too small or ill-fitting for Pacific women. Those working to bring the highly sought-after undergarments to the Pacific say the gift of a decent bra can make all the difference — without them, women can be discouraged from being active in the sporting arena or even in local community matters. Fifteen years ago Liz Baker, a chiropractor based in Melbourne, started the Uplift Project to help get bras to women in the Pacific.She told the ABC during that time the not-for-profit organisation has collected around 2.5 million bras.Through the help of local rotary clubs and a team of 300 volunteers, Uplift organises drop off points around Australia and New Zealand for people to donate bras. They are then sorted and sent on shipping containers to Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji.Naomi Roberts, the Fijian coordinator for Uplift, moved to Australia from Fiji when she was 17.""When I would go back to Fiji during school holidays the ladies in the village would ask 'do you have any spare bras?'"" she said.""So we would go to the markets and buy second-hand bras to take because we'd definitely be asked for one."" Last week the Uplift's New Zealand branch received more than 1500 bras from women's networks in Government departments, which are now set to be shipped to Fiji. Belinda Waters, from the New Zealand Ministry of Justice, said she was stunned by the mountain of donations.""The thing that really got me was that a lot of these women will never own another bra in their life — this is the only one they will ever get,"" she told Radio New Zealand. Ms Roberts said the bras provide support especially for women with bigger bust sizes who tend to hunch in order to hide their breasts.""In the village they will stand at the back and not say anything because they don't want them to be seen,"" she said. She added the need for affordable, good quality bras is not just about having an extra clothing option, but about dignity.""It's empowering … it's something that is theirs and theirs alone,"" she said. The bras aren't just important for women who have breasts but for those who have lost them.Ms Baker told the ABC Uplift also sends out breast forms and silicone breast prosthetics for women who had lost one or both breasts to cancer. It can restore their confidence, she said, rather than being a painful reminder of what they have been through.""Some women weep, especially if they have been given a breast form,"" she said.Sports bras are also particularly in demand with young girls wanting to get involved in sports.""They don't have to worry about putting their hands across their chest when they run,"" Ms Roberts said.It can even impact women competing at elite levels, with Ms Baker saying the issue impacts women wanting to play for Papua New Guinea's AFL team. ""When they came to visit Australia a while back, we noticed that it was only people who had A and B cups that were playing,"" she said, adding it was hard for those needing larger cup sizes to find the right support.The ABC has reached out to the PNG women's AFL team, but did not receive a response by deadline.However, the initiative is not without criticism. In the past, the Aloa Foundation in East Timor has criticised Uplift for undermining local businesses with its charity. Belinda Roselli is the founder of Mamma's Leaf Vanuatu — a charity that delivers washable sanitary pads and raises awareness around menstrual health with women in the villages. She has helped distribute bras for Uplift and says she has faced some backlash. ""There are some people who have said to me 'well, you shouldn't be bringing white women's expectations on life and what they think is normal into the Pacific',"" she said. But Ms Maafu said the bras have been warmly welcomed in Tonga, especially by those who need them most.She said specialised mastectomy bras were particularly appreciated by women who have suffered from breast cancer, as were maternity bras for new mothers. ""You can't believe how excited they are to receive those bras, because it's more expensive than the normal bra,"" Ms Maafu said.","Australia, Community and Society, Fiji, Foreign Aid, New Zealand, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Social Systems, Tonga, Vanuatu, Women's Health, Womens Status, ",2019-08-15 19:14:46+00:00

Eight-month-old baby Jasper is soon heading off on a short family holiday to Tonga, but is too young to be vaccinated against measles under the National Immunisation Program (NIP).The vaccine comes at a cost of about $50.Despite the country being considered low risk for measles, his travel doctor grandfather Bob Kass is worried he could bring the infectious disease back to Australia and his childcare centre.He has paid for his grandson to have the vaccine earlier and is urging other parents travelling with their babies to do the same.""He will be there for a short time, so most definitely if he was exposed there he'd be back in his childcare centre well within the incubation period and before the rash would occur,"" Dr Kass said.""We have a lot of parents out there who are travelling to what they deem to be low-risk places with children under 12 months and probably they would never seek advice … and I see this as a huge issue.""Dr Kass has been a travel doctor for 30 years.He worked as a paediatrician in Papua New Guinea during a measles epidemic in the 1980s and said what he witnessed scarred him.""I hadn't appreciated the damage that measles could cause and all around me I had children with a serious illness I couldn't help,"" he said.""They had blocked upper airways, tracheitis, tracheobronchitis, pneumonia, they had eye damage.""When you see what measles can do, you appreciate the value of vaccinations.""Under the national program, children are not vaccinated against measles until they reach 12 months of age.They also get a second dose at 18 months.Perth Children's Hospital paediatric infectious diseases specialist Asha Bowen said parents should vaccinate their children from six months if they were travelling overseas. ""The highest risk is when people leave our borders and go overseas and might be exposed to other people who have the measles virus,"" Dr Bowen told ABC News.""Measles is one of the most infectious and contagious diseases that we have.""It is not uncommon for someone to return to Australia with measles and then we do often see a small train of transmission.""The Australian Immunisation Handbook has recently updated its advice to recommend parents have their children vaccinated if they were travelling overseas, as the vaccine is safe from six months of age.However, an early vaccine is at the expense of parents and children will still need to have the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine again under the NIP.Dr Kass said both tiers of government should recommend babies in childcare centres get the vaccination earlier than 12 months of age.""What if that child came back to Australia during the incubation period, the parents had to go back to work and immediately the child was put in childcare with other children under 12 months?"" he said.""So by the time the child exhibits a rash … he or she has been spreading the virus to other children in … childcare.""Perhaps this is a group we should target because not everyone is going to do the right thing about immunisation before travel and there are a lot of children who might be at-risk in that scenario.""However, Dr Asha Bowen said it was ""a stretch"" to encourage babies in childcare to be vaccinated earlier.""I don't think at this stage we need to be escalating to give a measles vaccine to Australian-born children in Australian day care centres,"" she said.""It's an extra expense for families when we know the risk in those day care centres is very low because we don't have local transmission of measles.""If there is a case of measles detected that puts children in a particular day care at risk, the public health units will follow up and contact those families and provide immunisation.""Despite recommending people to vaccinate themselves against measles, doctors are struggling to get access to the measles vaccine due to a supply shortage.In a statement, the Department of Health said the shortage should ease by late September when new shipments of the measles vaccine were expected.It said in the meantime, the department was working with vaccine companies to manage supplies for the NIP and the private market.It said the measles vaccine was provided under the scheme for children up to the age of 19 and for refugee and humanitarian entrants of any age.","Adelaide, Australia, Babies, Diseases and Disorders, Doctors and Medical Professionals, Family and Relationships, Health, Infectious Diseases (Other), Perth, SA, Tonga, Travel Health and Safety, Travel and Tourism (Lifestyle and Leisure), Vaccines and Immunity, WA, ",2019-06-20 20:29:00+00:00

It is proper AFL rules but with just nine on the field at any point in time.""In Geneva the game is played on a smaller rugby field, using rugby goals for one set of goals along with some homemade point posts.""I think the skill level is surprisingly high,"" Ms Dellar said.""What's really nice about it is that there is such a mix of age ranges. In the Geneva team we have people in their 50s and teenagers and everything in between.""You have some players who are slightly more skilled, slightly more fit, but the standard and the spirit in which we play means that people of all skill levels can get involved.""It's quite a small field so there's a lot of sharing the ball around.""While the Geneva team is made up of almost all Australian expats, there is a player from Canada who spent his teenage years playing the game in Ontario and British Columbia.Many of the Winterthur players are former rugby players who have been taught Australian Rules by an Australian/Swiss dual national who developed a love the game while living in Australia as a child.Swiss teacher Ulrike Senti, 24, fell in love with Australian Rules when she studied abroad in Tasmania a few years ago.She wanted to continue playing once she returned to Europe and after a long search, she discovered the Winterthur Lions team.Ms Senti is now the head of women's development for AFL Switzerland.""It's a really challenging game but that's what I love about it,"" she said.""No-one is perfect at the beginning, you just need to practice and it needs different skills which is why I really like it.""You not only have to run fast but you have to get to know the ball's bounce. Handballing is also a big challenge for people from Europe because were not used to a bouncing ball.""Ms Senti said having Australian teammates playing in the Swiss league reminded her of life in Tasmania.""It is awesome to have Aussies in terms of footy and also in terms of my language,"" she said.""I'm still practicing talking to them and getting to know Australian culture even better.""I already fell in love with Australia when I was in Tasmania so that's why I really enjoy my job.""According to the AFL there are 4,487 participants playing in Europe and 1,165 of those are female.More than 180,000 people play outside of Australia and 44 per cent of those players are women.The countries with the biggest female participation are Papua New Guinea, South Africa and the South Pacific Nations.The Australian Football International Cup has been held in Melbourne every three years since 2002 and features a men's and women's competition.An all-female Australian Rules tournament, the Gallia Cup, was held in France on March 9 and saw teams from Germany, England and France and the Netherlands take part.Ms Senti was part of a group of Swiss women who combined forces with some German players to field a side in the Cup.They ended up winning the tournament.""It was the first all-women's competition that we have seen,"" Ms Dellar said.""In the past couple of years the women's element has been growing rapidly.""I certainly think AFL seems to be giving some European women the opportunity to get involved in sport where they might not have otherwise had that opportunity because you don't really see much of it around to be honest."" Both Ms Dellar and Ms Senti hope to see an all-women's competition established in Switzerland.""The mixed comp is great at the moment, but the dream would be to have individual women's teams from different cities that can play against each other,"" Ms Dellar said.""Hopefully this tournament in Paris has generated some momentum and certainly one of the next exciting things on the horizon is the Euro Cup.""The Euro Cup is an annual nine-a-side tournament in which national sides face-off to contest for the title of champions of Europe. The 2019 event will be held in Norrtalje, Sweden.""The Swiss men's team played last year and for the first time we will be sending a women's team,"" Ms Dellar said.""We will see how that goes in terms of generating a bit of publicity for AFL in Switzerland, particularly for the women.""","Australian National University, Australian Rules Football, Canada, Canberra, England, Fiji, France, Germany, Nauru, Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Perth, Samoa, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sport, Sport Event, Sports Organisations, Sweden, Switzerland, Tonga, Vanuatu, Winter Sports, ",2019-03-19 19:13:38+00:00

Australian National University's Geoffrey Clark and Griffith University's Michelle Langley teamed up to study the artefacts in detail, using radiocarbon dating technology to determine their age.It turns out they were 2,700 years old. ""The question has always been, were these tools introduced to the Pacific through migration, or were they developed in Polynesia where we know tattooing has a very prominent role in society and spread from there?,"" Associate Professor Clark said.""This discovery pushes the date of Polynesian tattooing right back to the beginnings of Polynesian cultures around 2,700 years ago.""The pair documented their findings in a research paper published this month, which had even more surprising details.Two of the tools were made from seabird bones, while the other two were made from the bones of a large mammal.""As there were no other mammals of that size on the island at the time, and human bone is known to be a preferred material for making tattooing combs, we believe they are most likely made from human bone,"" Dr Langley said.Associate Professor Clark said the bones could have been plucked from the graves of the tattooist's loved ones.""We know that early burials in the regions were constantly visited by people,"" he explained.""People were taking out things like skulls and limb bones.""We never really know why they were doing this, if they were using the bones in shrines or something.""The fact [the bones] were used tools like tattooing implements suggest that they were using the remains of relatives.""It's possible the tattooing process was used as a way of honouring and connecting with ancestors.But, as it was roughly 2,700 years ago, Associate Professor Clark says there was no way of knowing for sure.When explaining the tattooing process, he pointed out the word ""tattoo"" derives from the word ""tatau"", meaning to ""to strike"".He said the bone fragment would have been sharpened down into a blade or a comb before being fitted with a handle.The tattooist would then dip the tool into a small container filled with a natural ink and take another tool, something like a small baton, to drive the ink into the skin.""They hit the handle as they're tapping,"" Associate Professor Clark said.""As the tattooist is working they're tap, tap, tapping, they're driving the bone into the flesh.""As long as [the ink] goes beneath the dermis of the skin, [the tattoo] lasts.""Associate Professor Clark knows this all too well, being tattooed with the same technique 18 years ago.While these ancient tattooing methods make for lasting designs, they require a higher pain threshold to endure the procedure.""It's more painful than a standard electric tattoo gun,"" Associate Professor Clark said.""But it depends on how much of the body surface is being tattooed and where.""The discovery was exciting for the researchers, particularly as the kit was thought to be lost.The pieces had been kept in an offsite storage facility, which was destroyed in the Canberra firestorm of January, 2003.""We had assumed these important artefacts that we had had gone up in smoke,"" Associate Professor Clark said.""Later on it was found they had been taken out while someone had been studying them in another part of the university.""It was seven years before they realised the fragments had been spared from the horrific fires, with the artefacts lost amid the chaos.""Someone just contacted us and said 'we found this box',"" Associate Professor Clark said.""They said 'it looks to be full of archaeological material that you might be interested in it'.""While the ink pot originally found with the bones is still unaccounted for, parts of the tattoo kit are expected to go on public display later this year as part of Australian National University's anniversary celebrations.

It's mud, this light-coloured clay mud.""It's very sticky. So even though we'd seen it we didn't really know what it was, and I'm still a little baffled of where it's coming from. Because it's not ash.""The group photographed the new vegetation growing on an isthmus connecting the island to one of its neighbours, some of it possibly growing from bird droppings.They also saw a barn owl, which probably flew over from one of the islands next door, and hundreds of nesting sooty terns in the cliffs surrounding the island's crater lake.During his visit, Mr Slayback collected small rock samples for analysis back at NASA's labs, and tried to calculate the actual elevation of the island.He and the students used a GPS unit to take precise location measurements, and a drone to complete an aerial survey to help make a higher-resolution 3D map of the island.""It really surprised me how valuable it was to be there in person for some of this. It just really makes it obvious to you what is going on with the landscape,"" he said.Being there in person enabled a better observation and understanding of the deep gullies running down the side of the island's cone.""The island is eroding by rainfall much more quickly than I'd imagined,"" Mr Slayback said.""We were focused on the erosion on the south coast where the waves are crashing down, which is going on. It's just that the whole island is going down, too.""It's another aspect that's made very clear when you're standing in front of these huge erosion gullies,"" he said.""This wasn't here three years ago, and now it's two metres deep.""When it rose up out of the Pacific Ocean in early 2015 after the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha'apai volcano erupted, shooting rocks and lava into the sky, scientists did not expect the land mass to last.But three years later, it is still standing — and, according to NASA, is one of only three islands formed from volcanic eruptions in the last 150 years that have survived for more than a few months.While ""there's no map of the new land"", according to Mr Slayback, he and his colleagues have been watching it from satellites since its birth to try to understand why it has not yet been washed away.Since the visit Mr Slayback has reportedly been using the data collected at the island to create a more realistic 3D model of the site.This will help scientists better understand its volume, and how much volcanic ash and material erupted during its creation.Mr Slayback is also said to be planning another visit to Tonga, to help answer questions about the sea floor surrounding the island.This could help scientists to better understand why it is has so far been partially resistant to erosion — and why it has survived until now.","Earth Sciences, Pacific, Science and Technology, Space Exploration, Tonga, Volcanic Eruptions, ",2019-02-05 23:33:08+00:00

More recently, some tattoo artists have even been arrested because of an old law that says tattoos can only be done by doctors.Toks Fale — the aforementioned former rugby player who is now a professional wrestler — currently lives in Tokyo and where he is better known by his stage name ""Bad Luck Fale"" or ""The Underboss"".But he says the attitude to tattoos hasn't changed much since he first travelled to Japan about 20 years ago.""Being there for almost 20 years it's still the same, I still get stopped places,"" he says.""Sometimes I pretend I don't know anything, and I just walk right through [and] they either let me be or they come after me later.""He says he has found onsen that will allow him to enter but those venues often cater to Yakuza clients.""It's very intimidating because when you're in there you know these guys are part of the mafia.""But in Polynesian communities like Toks' birthplace of Tonga, and throughout Polynesia, the attitude to tattoos is very different.""We don't call them tattoos [because] they're more than just a body adornment,"" Jordan Clarke says.He works at Otautahi tattoo parlour in Auckland but explains that traditional Polynesian designs are known as ""tatau"", or ""ta moko"" in Maori culture.""There's a deeper meaning to the whole process … it speaks to the wearer's genealogy.""Wayne Hapi, a Maori tattoo artist who lives in Melbourne, says that getting a tatau or ta moko is often seen as a rite of passage.""My son he was 15 when I gave him his first tattoo but it was earned,"" he says.""It was a thing where he had to go and learn from our culture, a song, a prayer and things like that. That was what I wanted him to do to earn it.""Japan is hosting this year's Rugby World Cup at various venues around the country.With plenty of players sporting tattoos, including traditional Polynesian designs, New Zealand's rugby team the All Blacks have already said they'd respect local custom and cover up when they're in Japan.But one of the country's 47 administrative divisions, known as ""prefectures"", is actively working to make sure tattooed visitors can enjoy the region known as the ""onsen capital"" of Japan.Oita prefecture is home to both Oita city, which will host some of the World Cup matches, and Beppu city, which is famous for its hot springs.Beppu has already published a website listing the hundred or so onsen that do allow tattoos, and now Yuko Yamasaki is gathering information about hot springs that accept tattoos in the wider prefecture.""We want everyone to enjoy onsen,"" she says.""I think recently the perception of tattoos in Japan is also changing and many young people also have them. It's time to change.""With many international rugby players and their fans hailing from the Pacific, Toks Fale says the move makes sense.""I have been to Oita and Beppu and there are a lot of islanders [who] are going to school there,"" he says.""And if they want to capitalise on the fans and tourists [who] are going to be there for the Rugby World Cup, and also the Olympics next year, they need to ease up on it because I'd say most of the foreigners who come to Japan have tattoos.""","Asia, Community and Society, Human Interest, Japan, Pacific, Tonga, ",2019-01-27 19:21:04+00:00

Whether it be through ruling in absolute power or through the influence of their histories and long-running impact on their culture, the queen — and king — is very much alive.Excluding a clutch of states in the Asia-Pacific headed by Queen Elizabeth II, there are seven monarchies: Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and Tonga.Gavan Butler, honorary associate in political economy at the University of Sydney, tells ABC the monarchies are so entrenched in their respective countries that there has been no discussion or appetite to abolish them.But for Thailand and Malaysia, Michael Vatikiotis, Asia regional director at the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, says political stability is closely tied to that of their respective monarchies.""In all cases, the surviving monarchies of South-East Asia have power and influence that potentially or in reality exceed that described in constitutional terms,"" he says in an opinion piece for the Brookings Institution.""This has come about chiefly because of the continuity of the archaic sacred and cultural symbolism of monarchy, which the monarchs themselves have cleverly perpetuated — as well as the patronage derived from their considerable wealth.""2019 is set to be a big year for several monarchies in the region, including the abdication of the current Japanese emperor in April, in which his eldest son will take the Chrysanthemum Throne.This will be followed by coronation of the King of Thailand, who will be formally crowned in a lavish three-day ceremony in May.And in a shocking and unprecedented move, Malaysia's sultan Muhammad V abdicated earlier this week, which means that a new sultan will be elected within months.Here is a snapshot of some of the monarchies in the Asia-Pacific region:Style: Constitutional (formerly absolute)Monarch: King Jigme Khesar Namgyel WangchuckEstablished: 1907Succession: Hereditary (males are preferred over females and if there is no suitable candidate, the king can choose his own heir.)Fact: Bhutan's current king is the only monarch in the world who has ever given up power without any influence, pressure or expectation, but for the good of their country.Bhutan's hereditary monarchy was established in 1907 following several hundred years of loosely connected regions that the reigning Wangchuck family played a significant role in running.Since then, five kings have ascended the 'Golden Throne' and guided the relatively isolated country through several significant changes, including building ties with India and Britain, developing its highly lucrative tourism industry and the creation of its Gross National Happiness (GNH).GNH is Bhutan's guiding philosophy for socio-economic development, environmental sustainability, good governance, plus strong health, cultural diversity and high living standards.Current King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck shocked the country when he announced that he would be abandoning absolute monarchy in 2008 — but he retains significant influence and remains a highly popular figure.Style: AbsoluteMonarch: Sultan Hassanal BolkiahEstablished: 1400sSuccession: HereditaryFact: Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah is one of the richest men in the world thanks to Brunei's abundance of oil and gas reserves. His personal wealth is valued at $US40 billion ($56 billion), according to Forbes. This tiny country, sandwiched between the South China Sea and Malaysia, is one of the few absolute monarchies left in the world. Brunei does have a parliament, although elections haven't been held since 1962. And with a long history of invasion and foreign control, now-independent Brunei's laws are a mix of English common law and strict Sharia law.Despite the country's strict Islam-based morality, the royal family is well known for its ostentatious spending, which includes living in one of the world's biggest palace, despite the country's population being just 436,733.The sultan's brother, Prince Jefri, is commonly dubbed the ""playboy"" prince and reportedly owns a luxury yacht named ""Tits"".Because of Brunei's natural resources, it ranks as the world's fifth richest nation and has one of the highest quality of living in the world.Sultan Bolkiah celebrated his 50th anniversary on the throne in 2017, making him the seconding-longest reigning monarch in the world still living, behind only Queen Elizabeth II.Style: ConstitutionalMonarch: King Norodom SihamoniEstablished: 1st century ADSuccession: ElectiveFact: Cambodia followed in the footsteps of Thailand and in 2018 introduced majeste law, which makes it a crime to criticise or insult the king.Cambodia's historic monarchy is well documented and has undergone several dramatic evolutions since it was established 2000 years ago.This includes the names of its very first monarch, who was a woman — Queen Soma, who ruled alongside her husband, Kaundinya I.In a highly unusual move, the monarch's succession was moved to an elective model in 1993, one of just two in the world. The elected monarch, who holds the role for life, must be at least 30 years old and whose lineage can be traced to one of either two of Cambodia's historic royal houses, the house of Norodom or the house of Sisowatch.The king's role is ceremonial but he does in fact hold some power, including appointing the prime minister and cabinet. He also has the power of commutation and pardon, and can appoint a limited number of members to the Senate and Constitutional Council.In a highly embarrassing move, in 2011 WikiLeaks released hundreds of diplomatic cables from the US Embassy, some of which describe the monarchy as a ""tragedy, comedy and melodrama all rolled into one that could have provided grist for at least a half dozen Shakespeare plays"".Style: ConstitutionalMonarch: Emperor AkihitoEstablished: 660 BCSuccession: Hereditary (males only)Fact: During World War II, Emperor Hirohito placed himself as the head of Japan's traditional religion, Shinto, which led to the development of an extremist cult that created the infamous kamikaze bombers. Home to the world's oldest continuing monarchy, the Japanese imperial family are highly revered by the public and are the only monarchy that is still led by an emperor.Historically, the emperor did wield some power, but never had complete authority and in 1947, the monarchy was formally stripped of any power and was instead shaped as ""the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people"".The emperor and imperial family now play an important role in national ceremonies and traditions.The imperial family are set for a momentous 2019 when Emperor Akihito voluntarily abdicates and his son, Crown Prince Naruhito, takes on the role.Like parts of Japanese culture, the monarchy retains several archaic rules, including that only sons can succeed and that any female royal who marries a commoner must cede her title and royal income.Style: ConstitutionalMonarch: Sultan Muhammad V (abdicated January 2019)Established: 1957Succession: ElectiveFact: Sultan Muhammad V, who was only two years into his five-year term, abdicated in early January 2019, just weeks after it was widely reported that he had secretly married Russian Oksana Voevodina, a former Miss Moscow who has a degree in business, although neither the Malaysian Government nor palace has confirmed.The king of this Asian country is not born to rule but elected instead. Although the current system was established in 1957, monarchies across some of Malaysia's 13 states and three federal territories date back to the 16th century.Monarchs are elected to a five-year term by the rulers of nine of Malaysia's states, whom together form the Conference of Rulers. Only these nine rulers can stand for the kingship, and all must be male, Malay Muslims of royal origin; most of those nine states have hereditary rulers.The king, also known as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, has extensive powers through the constitution, although in reality those powers are in fact quite limited. He can choose the prime minister from those elected into parliament, although he cannot dismiss the prime minister. His role also includes attending diplomatic functions and being the symbolic head of the Malaysian Armed Forces.Style: ConstitutionalMonarch: King Maha Vajiralongkorn Established: 1238Succession: HereditaryFact: The monarch has several additional titles, including Head of State, Head of the Royal Thai Armed Forces, Adherent of Buddhism and Upholder of Religions.Thai's monarchy converted to constitutional-style in 1932 following a bloodless coup and is now a high-profile symbolic head of state; the king's power is now exclusively exercised through the prime minister and parliament.Despite that, the monarch is treated as a near-divine being, with current laws making it illegal to defame or insult the monarch or his family — offenders face up to 15 years in jail.There is no actual definition of what constitutes 'defaming' or insulting the monarchy, and so it has been open to wide interpretation with hundreds of people fined or jailed in recent years.In 2018, King Vajiralongkorn — who ascended the throne in 2016 and will be formally crowned in an elaborate three-day coronation in early May — signed over the royal family's $30 billion wealth to himself.Style: ConstitutionalMonarch: Tupou VIEstablished: 10th centurySuccession: Hereditary (males preferred)Fact: There are six monarchies in Oceania, but Tonga is the only sovereign indigenous monarchy.Tonga became a constitutional monarchy in 1875 but its origins go back far further, with the first rulers taking control in the 10th century. During the 19th century, the then-king converted to Christianity, which quickly spread throughout the country's 172 islands. Today, the overwhelming majority of Tongans are Christians, with many being active members of their churches.Despite having its own monarchy, Tonga is also a member of the Commonwealth, one of just four countries in the group whose monarch is not Queen Elizabeth II. It follows its status as a British protected state between 1900 and 1970, meaning that Britain looked after its foreign affairs but never had any sovereign power.The previous monarch, George Tupou V, ceded most of his powers just days after his coronation in 2008, saying he and future monarchs would take the advice of the prime minister on most issues.","Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Foreign Affairs, Japan, Malaysia, Politics and Government, Royalty, Thailand, Tonga, World Politics, ",2019-01-08 19:10:46+00:00
194,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-12-30/meghan-markle-year-2018-rumours-starting/10672700,"This year saw the Duchess of Sussex officially join the Royal family, marry Prince Harry in what was undeniably the biggest wedding of 2018 (sorry, Eugenie), and casually announce a pregnancy months later.But despite the ""happily ever after"" line peddled by fairytales, behind the scenes things have been far from smooth for the Duchess of Sussex.For the newly minted Royal, the year has also involved endless media coverage, widespread criticism, racism and an alleged feud with Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge — all in addition to her storybook romance.As the year draws to a close, we take a look at Meghan's 2018 and have a peek at what 2019 has in store.While it may feel like it happened a lifetime ago, Harry and Meghan were married on May 19 in a ceremony at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.Unsurprisingly, all eyes were on what the bride was wearing. Meghan made a statement in a Givenchy wedding gown with an open bateau neckline designed by Clare Waight Keller, the fashion house's first female artistic director.A mere five months after the wedding-to-end-all-weddings, Meghan and Harry announced they were expecting their first child, set to arrive in the spring of 2019 (autumn in the Southern Hemisphere).The news — which came one day after Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbanks' wedding on October 12 — was shared as Harry and Meghan arrived in Sydney at the beginning of their 16-day Royal tour of Australia, New Zealand, Tonga and Fiji.As Harry and Meghan embarked on their first Royal tour in October, it felt as if they could do no wrong.The pair attended more than 70 engagements over the course of the whirlwind visit, meeting koalas in Australia, celebrating athletes at Harry's Invictus Games and visiting the King and Queen of Tonga.The parallels to Princess Diana came in thick and fast as Meghan stayed up late to bake banana bread for local farmers in Australia and again as she gave an impassioned speech about women's suffrage in New Zealand, the first country to give women the vote.Basically, it seemed as if the only way was up for the newlyweds.That is, until reports of a less-than-sisterly bond between Meghan and Kate surfaced in November.The alleged feud started when Kate was reportedly left in tears after the fitting for Princess Charlotte's bridesmaid dress ahead of the Royal wedding.A second report emerged earlier this month claiming the sisters-in-law had an argument over the way Meghan treated a member of Kate's staff.Because pitting women against one another is one of society's favourite pastimes, the alleged incident escalated to the point that Kensington Palace issued a public statement, insisting, ""this never happened"".News of the ""feud"" was followed by associated drama between brothers William and Harry, and by Harry and Meghan's decision to move out of Kensington Palace — where William and Kate live — to Frogmore Cottage in Windsor in 2019, officially breaking up the ""Fab Four"". Things appeared to turn from bad to worse when none other than the Queen herself reportedly confronted Meghan over the feud with Kate earlier this month.According to Australian Women's Weekly editor-at-large and Royal correspondent Juliet Rieden, ""the feud is a massive storm in a teacup"".""It has been completely blown out of proportion by the media, who every day need to come up with a different story,"" she said.Why, then, are we so obsessed?""The media will continue to concoct these stories as long as they get interest from the public, and now that interest is quantifiable with the internet,"" Ms Rieden explained.""We're all sensible people — we read these stories and we realise it's based on one flick of an eye or some tiny little detail that could be interpreted in so many different ways, and we all realise we've been had.""But, by that time the story has been read, the click has been registered and another story is being created.""According to Royal correspondent and commentator James Brookes, we should view Meghan and Harry's move to Windsor in much the same light as the rest of the ""feud"".""The move seems more like a logistical one and one that comes back to Harry and Meghan wanting to forge their own path,"" he said.""Harry's spent the last few years in his brother's shadow … so it's understandable.""Mr Brookes put the Queen's alleged involvement down to rumour.""The Queen's worked hard to try and welcome [Meghan] into the family and she'll be all too aware from Prince Philip's experiences of being an outsider how isolated that situation can make one feel,"" he said.She has only been a Royal for eight months, but Meghan has already broken protocol at least 18 times — if numerous media reports are to be believed.According to Mr Brookes, the media often gets it wrong.""There's been a lot of talk, particularly in the British press, of Meghan breaking so-called 'protocol',"" he said.""A lot of it is rubbish. The 'shutting her own car door' is a good example — many times, the Royals have someone there to open their car door for them and they're straight out and into greeting people, but if there's nobody there to shut it and it's in the way, they'll close it themselves.""Remember, they are human after all.""With a baby due in Spring, a move to Windsor on the horizon and a new patronage from the Queen set to be announced, Meghan's 2019 is likely to be just as fast-paced.Aside from the Royal baby — which Ms Rieden said will ""break the internet"" — we can expect Meghan to continue following her passion of representing female empowerment, and maybe even using her experiences with racism to talk about racial issues in a first for the Royals.""It's all very well having white and privileged members of the monarchy standing up and trying to support multiracial communities, but to actually have someone who is themselves multiracial gives it more credence, and I can't imagine she wouldn't want to be that role model,"" Ms Rieden said.""We've [already seen that] in the cookbook she wrote for [the victims of] Grenfell Tower.""[Meghan is] already making pretty powerful speeches [on female empowerment], which is quite new for the Royal family, and especially for the wife of a member of the Royal family.""The Royal correspondent said she expects the Queen will hand Meghan a patronage linked to the theatre — an industry close to Meghan's heart.While this is yet to be confirmed, whatever patronage Meghan is tasked with, 2019 will be ""a time for her to settle into her new role and start to develop it and show the world the type of Royal she wants to be,"" according to Mr Brookes.""It's also a time for her to realise that the press coverage will always be there … that's something that will take a little time to adjust to — either by ignoring it altogether or developing a thick skin.""At least one thing is for sure — 2018 was the year of the Duchess of Sussex.And if we consider society's obsession with Meghan's departed mother-in-law Princess Diana — which ultimately led to her untimely death with the involvement of the paparazzi — this is unlikely to change.","Australia, Family and Relationships, Fiji, Human Interest, Marriage, New Zealand, Pregnancy and Childbirth, Royalty, Tonga, United Kingdom, ",2018-12-29 19:14:15+00:00

196,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-16/are-china-cheap-loans-to-poor-nations-a-debt-trap/10493286,"China is in the midst of a rapid push to gain economic and political ascendancy across the globe — and it is splashing out billions of dollars in concessional loans to developing countries in the process.This money is used to construct much-needed major infrastructure projects, but what happens when these poorer countries cannot pay China back?Experts warn Beijing is using bad loans as a form of entrapment, allowing the nation to gain influence and power across the world.Here's how they say it works.Poorer nations are lured by China's offers of cheap loans for transformative infrastructure projects.Then, when these countries are unable to keep up with their repayments, Beijing can demand concessions or other advantages in exchange for debt relief. This process is known as debt-trap diplomacy.Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port development project serves as a cautionary tale to anyone who thinks China's loans come without conditions.Protests erupted last year when Sri Lanka was forced to hand control of the port over to China — on a 99-year lease — in order to wipe off about $US1 billion ($1.4 billion) worth of its debt to Beijing.China now has control of a key port on the doorstep of regional rival India, and a strategic foothold along a key commercial and military waterway.A little closer to home, Australia has been a bit sluggish to respond to China's spreading influence in the Pacific.Chinese loans and aid have gone from almost zero to $1.8 billion in the space of a decade, and some of our neighbours are already heavily-laden with debt to Beijing.However, China has also pledged to spend $US5.8 billion ($8 billion) in total across the Pacific region.For instance, Beijing has promised Papua New Guinea an incredible $US3.5 billion ($4.8 billion) for a new road network, which would stem from its capital Port Moresby. Fiji owes China half a billion dollars, and Tonga now owes more than $160 million, or one-third of its GDP.Tonga has been forced to admit it may fail to repay its debts, stoking fears other small Pacific nations could fall into debt distress and become vulnerable to diplomatic pressure from Beijing.In fact Tonga's Prime Minister this year even went as far as calling on the Pacific Islands to band together against China — before backtracking on that call days later, for reasons that remain unclear.Earlier this year, reports that China was moving to create a military base in Vanuatu sparked a panic in Australia, and served as a catalyst for a renewed pivot to reclaim regional influence.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has now announced the creation of a new infrastructure bank for projects across the region, seen largely as a pushback against Chinese influence.China's President Xi Jinping is currently in Port Moresby for this year's APEC summit, where he will hold a special meeting with Pacific Island leaders.Mr Xi is expected to put even more concessional loans on the table at that side meeting — so watch this space.At the heart of the issue of Chinese investment is Mr Xi's flagship economic policy, the One Belt One Road initiative.It is a trillion-dollar project aimed at connecting countries across continents for trade, with China at its centre.Beijing has characterised the project as a win-win for both its global trade ambitions and infrastructure-starved developing nations.But in reality, many vulnerable countries are finding themselves overwhelmed by Chinese debt.In 2011, Tajikistan reportedly handed over land on its disputed border with China to repay some of its debts.China loaned Montenegro more than a billion dollars to build a key highway linking its Port of Bar to landlocked Serbia, with construction led by a Chinese company.However, due to currency issues and problems with the blueprint, costs blew out and the project remains only partially completed.Now debt levels in the fledgling European state are at 80 per cent of GDP, and Montenegro faces the prospect of either abandoning the project or negotiating for more money from China — pushing it deeper into Beijing's sphere of influence.In Africa, China is financing major projects across the continent, and Beijing's level of investment is gathering pace.[China Zambia airport image]In September, Mr Xi promised Africa $82 billion for development over three years — in 2015, it gave countries on the continent the same amount.China's investment in Zambia for example is impossible to miss — schools, surgeries and construction projects bear Chinese symbols, and a vast new network of roads is being built with Chinese finance.But the debt is mounting there, with Chinese loans accounting for up to a third of the country's total $13 billion national debt.For now many countries are enjoying the new highways, airports and promises of economic development, but it may only be a matter of time until they, too, are overwhelmed by debt.And the increasing reliance on Chinese investment around the world is raising concerns about how geopolitical power dynamics are shifting in the 21st century.Some countries, spooked by Sri Lanka's port handover last year, are starting to wind back their reliance on Chinese finance — Nepal and Pakistan for instance cancelled major projects in 2017.But it's not just developing countries that find themselves indebted to China.In fact, Beijing is the number one holder of US debt, owning $US1.1 trillion ($1.52 trillion) in government bonds.Amid the debates about China's growing influence and fears Beijing wants to expand its strategic military presence across the globe, it's easy to forget they have only one overseas military base — in the small east African nation of Djibouti. The United States meanwhile has an estimated 800 bases across 70 countries.So while Chinese money may be putting some countries at risk, and Beijing could be wielding its loans as a strategic tool, it's not the only country projecting its power around the world.Just how deep Mr Xi's ambitions run remains unclear, but there's no doubt he plans on China leading the way in what has been dubbed the Asian Century — and not following the pack.","China, Djibouti, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, International Aid and Trade, Montenegro, Pacific, Politics and Government, Tonga, United States, World Politics, Zambia, ",2018-11-15 19:37:47+00:00

The two sides have never met before, but Tonga — with a team full of NRL and English Super League stars — are out to demonstrate that their tier-two ranking does not do them justice.A competitive performance from the Mata Ma'a, let alone a win over the Kangaroos, could go a long way to changing the international calendar and generating more high-profile games for all the Pacific island teams.For Tonga's coach, Kristian Woolf, the importance of the game cannot be underestimated.""We've been very vocal about our desire to get these types of opportunities and we need to make sure that we back that up with performances,"" he said. ""The performance that we put in against Australia this weekend is extremely important for us going forward.""I like to think it's very much the start of us changing things in the future.""What many pundits view as a power shift in the game began prior to the World Cup last year, when a host of top stars with dual nationality who had previously played for Australia or New Zealand opted to switch their allegiance to Tonga, including the Cronulla Sharks' Andrew Fifita.With one World Cup winners medal in the bag, he said it would have been all too easy to stick with Australia and get a second one, but family loyalty and the nature of the challenge persuaded him to jump ship.""If I look back at my childhood, I think I have to give something back to my father. When I told him I was going to represent him and my grandparents, he was forever grateful and he started crying. So you can tell how much it means to our people and out tiny island of Tonga,"" he said.Fifita said for he and his Tongan teammates, taking on the world champions will be bigger than the NRL's annual show piece — State of Origin.""I've got 16 people coming from Australia for this game, and I know a lot of the boys' families are coming over, I've got family from Tonga coming over. This game means the world to us.""Coach Kristian Woolf said Tonga had earned their chance to challenge the world's top team, but they wanted more high-profile games, and more for the other tier two Pacific teams, Samoa, Fiji and Papua New Guinea.""What we think we deserve is opportunities like this to continue to play tier one nations and continue to be a part of big occasions and big events,"" Woolf said.Those big occasions could come in the form of a Pacific championship which the Rugby League International Federation has suggested it would like to introduce as early as next year.Victory for Tonga over Australia might just speed up that process and add a new level of competition to the international game.","Australia, NRL, Pacific, Rugby League, Sport, Tonga, ",2018-10-19 04:22:33+00:00

The greater danger with these clots is that they can dislodge and travel through the circulatory system, blocking blood supply to the lungs.The risk of DVT is higher when pregnant and being immobile for long periods is also a risk factor, so it's worth keeping in mind for any sort of travel, including long car trips.But the risks with long-haul flights can be easily reduced with loose clothing and exercises to help with circulation.  Victoria Government's Better Health website suggests if there is no turbulence, then pregnant women should try to walk up and down the aisle every 30 minutes.And if there is a baby bump, then the seatbelt should be under the bump and across the lap.According to Brisbane obstetrician Dr Will Milford, while there are some special things you should take into consideration, flying while pregnant carries very little additional risk. ""Flying does not have any effect on the pregnancy,"" Dr Milford said when he spoke to the ABC last year.""You're not more likely to go into labour or break your waters from flying. ""What airlines are worried about is a woman giving birth on the plane, the risk of which obviously increases as you get close to your due date.""Some airlines don't allow women to fly as they near the due date. And in Australia, major airlines often require pregnant women to get a note from their doctor after 28 weeks.For both Qantas and Virgin Australia, women without pregnancy complications are allowed to travel on flights of four hours or more up to the end of the 36th week for single pregnancies, and the end of the 32nd week for twins (and triplets, etc).For flights less than four hours, you can travel up to the end of the 40th week in a single pregnancy and the 36th week for a multiple pregnancy.However, the rules differ from airline to airline, so pregnant women should always check before booking and/or flying.","Australia, Fiji, Human Interest, Lifestyle and Leisure, Royalty, Tonga, Travel Health and Safety, Travel and Tourism (Lifestyle and Leisure), United Kingdom, Women's Health, ",2018-10-16 00:05:07+00:00

According to Chinese state media, the ship has 300 beds, eight operating theatres, and can conduct 60 surgeries in a day.The Peace Ark said it has so far provided free medical treatment to more than 4,000 people in PNG's capital Port Moresby, 4,500 people in Vanuatu, 6,000 in Fiji and more than 5,500 patients in Tonga.In smaller nations with strained health care systems, that is a significant figure.And both the tempo and scale of these humanitarian missions are increasing as strategic competition heats up in the Pacific.China is not the only nation using its navy as a public diplomacy tool.Aid is an important resource for the Pacific Islands region, but public information is often lacking. The Lowy Institute Pacific Aid Map is designed to enhance aid effectiveness.Last week the Indian frigate INS Sahyadri stopped off in Fiji's capital Suva, offering free medical screenings to hundreds of people in a public park.The Sahyadri isn't a hospital ship like the Peace Ark and its medical outreach is much more modest.But the message being conveyed is the same — India, like China, is a capable and generous power, with both the capacity and the goodwill to help smaller nations which sometimes struggle to deliver basic services.The Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese embassy in Fiji, Yang Zhaohui, told local reporters that the Peace Ark was a powerful symbol.""Serving as a peace messenger, the Peace Ark embodies China's new secu­rity concept with peace, development and cooperation,"" he said.How about Australia?Canberra doesn't have the resources to match Beijing, but our doctors and nurses have been working on the US Nursing Ships Mercy and Brunswick, which have offered free healthcare to a host of Pacific Island and South-East Asian nations this year.Australian medical experts on some of our largest naval vessels have also conducted medical workshops in Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga and Samoa, as well as helping with Australia's disaster relief efforts across the region.Hospital ships generate plenty of attention, and both the Peace Ark and the Sahyadri have been greeted by glowing headlines across the Pacific region.But are their visits invaluable public health interventions — or empty media stunts?Dr Tess Cain from TNC Pacific consulting said that whenever the Peace Ark has pulled into port it has been greeted by long queues of people who want medical help.""They are obviously meeting some need because we've seen in all of the ports of call there have been thousands of people wanting to take advantage of the services available,"" she said.However there are limits on what these ships can provide.Doctors on hospital ships can offer useful health checks and fix niggling problems like toothaches and abscesses.The Peace Ark has also conducted more complex surgeries while in the Pacific, such as fixing eye cataracts.But the ships are only ever in port for a short period of time, so medical professionals who are only stopping off simply cannot provide the long-term care and follow-up which is needed to deal with chronic disease, particularly lifestyle diseases like diabetes, cirrhosis and hypertension.""If you talk to people who manage public health budgets, they would say — quite rightly — that these ships are not able to contribute to some of the bigger, long-term issues that these countries are dealing with, like the management of non-communicable diseases,"" Dr Cain said.""These ships are not geared for that.""Still, that might be changing.When the Peace Ark departed Port Moresby it left behind a team of 10 Chinese medical specialists.They'll spend the next three years working in the capital's General Hospital.Dr Cain said that could set a new precedent for hospital ships in the region.""This is quite a significant investment, and it will be interesting to see if other countries in the region look at that and decide they will also make a request to the Chinese Government as well,"" she said.And if China leads — then other nations might soon follow.","China, Foreign Aid, Health, India, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, United States, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2018-08-21 19:23:45+00:00
208,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-20/tonga-prime-minister-changes-mind-on-china-loan-issue/10138068,"It was a rapid change of heart.On Thursday last week, Tonga's Prime Minister was protesting that his small Pacific Island nation would struggle to pay back the money it owes to China.Tonga's debt distress was ""serious"", declared Akilisi Pohiva, ""very serious"".But the Prime Minister wasn't just complaining. He had a plan.Mr Pohiva wanted to join forces with other Pacific Island nations struggling with the same problem.And they would use the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) — the region's premier diplomatic gathering — as a platform to lobby Beijing for debt relief.""I think these small countries will eventually come together to find a way out,"" he told the ABC.One day later, everything changed. At around 6:30pm on Friday (Tonga time), Mr Pohiva's office issued a press statement announcing the Prime Minster had changed his mind.About everything.""After further reflection, I now believe that the Pacific Islands Forum is not the proper platform to discuss this debt issue,"" Mr Pohiva's statement said.""Each Pacific Island country has its particular national conditions and different needs for foreign loan, and it's up to each government to independently seek solutions through bilateral channels.""The Prime Minister also said the loans from China — used to rebuild Tonga's capital after riots in 2006 — were ""crucial for the Kingdom's economic recovery and maintenance of social stability"".Tonga was ""exceedingly grateful"" for development aid from Beijing and the two countries would continue to discuss solutions for repayment through ""friendly consultation"".The about-face was as absolute as it was sudden. And it left a lot of questions unanswered.Why the change of heart? Did China complain, or threaten consequences? Or did something else prompt the Prime Minister's startling retraction?Mr Pohiva has long complained that his nation will struggle to repay the $160 million it borrowed from China's Export-Import Bank.But it seems he first widely canvassed his contentious plan to draw PIF into the controversy during a meeting of Pacific Island Foreign Ministers on August 10 in Samoa.The ABC has been told Mr Pohiva didn't raise the proposal during formal proceedings, but he did lobby several ministers about the issue on the meeting's sidelines.Mr Pohiva laid out his strategy in an interview with the Samoa Observer, published on August 14.He told the Observer that Pacific leaders should sign a ""submission … asking the Chinese Government to forgive their debts"".Beijing might be more willing to listen to the pleas of countries like Tonga, he said, if leaders at PIF in Nauru in next month issued a joint statement calling on China to show lenience.The story was quickly picked up by other media outlets — including the South China Morning Post and Radio New Zealand.The ABC interviewed Mr Pohiva on August 16, and he was adamant that Pacific Island countries should work together to press China to back down on repayments.""China has to take into consideration all the countries that have loans,"" he said.The suggestion was contentious because it revived a fraught debate about China's strategic ambitions in an increasingly contested region.Australia remains the largest donor to the Pacific by a wide margin, but it's become increasingly anxious about the amount of Chinese debt taken on by some Pacific nations, and the leverage this gives to officials in Beijing.Aid is an important resource for the Pacific Islands region, but public information is often lacking. The Lowy Institute Pacific Aid Map is designed to enhance aid effectiveness.Minister for International Development Concetta Fierravanti-Wells has been a public critic of China's approach.On August 16, Senator Fierravanti-Wells told the ABC that Mr Pohiva's suggestion had merit — and agreed Pacific leaders should discuss the issue in Nauru.""I think it is important that it is discussed because it is a vitally important issue to so many countries in the Pacific,"" she said.But the Prime Minister would back down less than 24 hours later.So, who picked up the phone — or made a visit to Mr Pohiva's office — to force his hand?Mr Pohiva's office has not given an explanation about what happened — and the ABC's attempts to reach the Chinese embassy in Tonga have not been successful.The ABC has been told that China did raise objections to the Tongan Prime Minister's plan, and made a complaint.But the nature of that complaint — and its force and magnitude — are not clear.Of course, Beijing's loan gives it enormous leverage over Tonga.Dr Graeme Smith from the Australian National University said it was plausible that China may have used that leverage to force Mr Pohiva to back down.But he said it is also possible that other Pacific nations heavied Mr Pohiva because they wanted to avoid PIF being consumed by a messy debate about China.""The other possibility is that other members of PIF told him to pull his head in,"" he said.""Tonga is a player in PIF, but there are larger players — one of whom [Papua New Guinea] is about to host APEC.""Even if Mr Pohiva had stuck to his guns, he may have faced an uphill struggle to push the issue to centre stage at PIF.Tonga is not the only Pacific country which may have borrowed too heavily from China.Samoa has also borrowed substantial sums, and experts say Papua New Guinea is becoming increasingly reliant on Chinese debt as well.But the problem is not universal.Vanuatu has borrowed plenty of money from Beijing, but recent analysis suggests its financial position has improved substantially.Dr Smith said many Pacific Island nations were in a much better financial position than Tonga and still have an appetite for loans from overseas.Many of those countries would have nothing to gain — and plenty to lose — by picking a fight with China.""I don't think you've got a sufficient quorum of countries under debt distress — it strikes me as unlikely that it would get up,"" Dr Smith said.""Things look very different, depending where you are in the Pacific.""Of course, that doesn't make Tonga's position any less excruciating.""They have some reason to feel hard done by,"" Dr Smith said.""The Chinese contractor at the centre of this loan gave assurances privately to Tongan Government officials not to worry, that down the line this debt would be forgiven.""Dr Smith said his research shows this is a common pattern in the Pacific.""This is part of the pitch when a loan is being sold at the beginning. And it's disingenuous,"" Dr Smith said.""China does forgive loans, but only zero interest loans. It has almost no record of forgiving concessional loans.""So even if Pacific leaders don't breathe a word about debt and China when they sit down for formal meetings — there might be plenty of chatter in the corridors just outside the room.","Asia, Australia, China, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Pacific, Tonga, World Politics, ",2018-08-19 19:22:06+00:00

""The sub-committee feel there is a need for action from the region's leadership to address this.""Fiji National University (FNU) Associate Professor Pragya Singh, who is overseeing a pilot program that aims to prevent childhood obesity in the Pacific, said studies showed that 40 to 70 per cent of children who are obese today would become an obese adult.""Apart from this, we are seeing the trends are increasing … this is the magnitude of the problem,"" she said.Colin Tukuitonga, director general of the Pacific Community organisation, said there was ""very good evidence"" that NCDs such as diabetes and heart diseases were a relatively recent phenomenon in the Pacific.""In fact there was some studies that linked to the introduction of the refrigerator,"" Dr Tukuitonga said.""And we do know it's closely correlated with increasing consumptions of highly processed food and sugar-sweetened beverages.""Soft drinks are popular in the Pacific, with many people consuming litres of them each day.Up until a year ago, Samoan Betty Pinati drank at least 4 litres daily.""I thought if I drink this kind of soft drink I would look like a millionaire in the eyes of other people,"" the 29-year-old said.""In Samoa, people think that that lady [who] is drinking soft drinks is rich in the eyes of people … but we didn't look at the other way around that it affected our bodies and our healthy lifestyle.""Ms Pinati said a big part of the appeal was that soft drinks were often cheaper to buy than water.In a bid to tackle rising obesity Samoa and several of its Pacific neighbours have introduced a sugar tax, but Dr Tukuitonga said there was evidence big corporations planned to lobby against those efforts.""Without a doubt there will be studies, not directly by the industry, but through groups supported by industry that would continue try create doubt in the minds of policy makers, that taxes on soft drinks work,"" he said.The global giant Coca Cola did confirm to the ABC that a recently advertised marketing role based in New Zealand, was ""in line with our approach that beverage taxes have been shown to be ineffective as a means of combating obesity.""But the company also said that it was committed to the health and wellbeing of Pasifika communities and had recently launched a low-sugar option for some of its products in Samoa.But regardless, Ms Pinati has stopped consuming soft drinks.She said she had not only lost 70 kilograms — from 178 to 107 kilograms — in the past year, but her health has improved significantly.""[Before] I couldn't breath normally and was easily affected by viral diseases like cold and flu and dengue fever,"" she said.""I was sick for a whole month.

For us to have these issues discussed and at the forefront, that's fantastic. What we've got to be careful of it's a social media campaign, and sometimes it can be detrimental to the process.""However Mr Leo argues that process still leaves the Pacific Islands short on power.""We really want to step the campaigning up and achieve fairness and equity for the Pacific Islands. It's an education process, a slow burner, but it does feel like we're getting somewhere now,"" he said.Comment has been sought from the World Rugby Council.","Community and Society, Fiji, Pacific, Rugby Union, Samoa, Sport, Tonga, ",2018-08-10 20:06:04+00:00

Nearly two-thirds of that is owed to China's Exim Bank.Principal repayments on the two loans will see the Government's foreign debt repayments double to $15.6 million this financial year.That's more than the $11 million the Government has budgeted for post-cyclone reconstruction work.""There are definitely people in Tonga who would be feeling disappointed, let down,"" Graeme Smith, an expert on China's activity in the Pacific at the Australian National University, said.""But certainly, they can't say no-one warned them that this day would come.""Tonga's Chinese debt is held up by some as a prime example of what's been called China's debt-trap diplomacy in the Pacific region.Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is among those to voice concerns about the potential for unsustainable debt burdens to erode the sovereignty of Pacific Island nations.But there is also criticism of the previous Tongan government that took on the loans and its management of the funds.""Money was left over, it got put towards renovating the Royal Palace in Tonga which definitely gives no return to Tonga as a whole,"" Dr Smith said.""Also it was complicated in the sense that even the money for the reconstruction was then re-loaned out to a few Tongan businesses and they haven't paid back the loan of the loan.""Dr Smith said he believes Tonga's handling of the Chinese loans should serve as a warning to other Pacific Island nations.""How well Chinese aid is used comes down to the state of governance in the recipient country, and if your recipient country isn't able to handle the money sensibly or in a transparent way, then you get problems like this,"" he said.","Asia, China, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Pacific, Tonga, World Politics, ",2018-07-19 07:18:37+00:00

Businesses need to identify any modern slavery in their supply chain If passed, the laws will mean around 3,000 businesses in Australia with an annual turnover of $100 million or more will need to identity any modern slavery in their supply chain, and report it to authorities.   ""Businesses will then have to detail what steps they have taken, and will take, to address these risks,"" said Assistant Minister for Home Affairs Alex Hawke.""This bill will enable large businesses, consumers, civil society and government to work together to eliminate modern slavery in supply chains.""A Modern Slavery Business Engagement Unit, costing $3.6 million, will be set up the reporting requirements and support the 3,000 affected Australian businesses.Modern slavery includes where people are forced into prostitution, or forced to work for low wages in construction, sweatshops or food supply chains. It can include also underpayment of wages, denied visa extensions by employers or being forced to live in squalid accommodation.Opposition justice spokesperson Clare O'Neil said the bill was weak because it did not set a penalty for businesses that refused to report on slavery in their supply chain.  ""It shouldn't be optional to decide whether you follow the law or not,"" she said. ""The penalties Labor is calling for are not for businesses that find slavery in their supply chain, because businesses who find slavery and do something about it should be applauded,"" she said. ""We are talking about businesses that can't even be bothered complying with the modern slavery act, because if they can't be bothered making a report, then I think they should be penalised.""A department spokesperson told the ABC penalties  were not needed to ensure business followed the law, but the law would be reviewed  in three years to see if it was working. ""Business feedback indicates the primary driver for compliance will be investor pressure and reputational costs and benefits,"" the spokesperson said. ""This will drive compliance more effectively than legislated penalties and encourage a business-led 'race to the top'"".Labor also criticised the bill for not establishing an independent modern slavery commissioner, similar to the United Kingdom model, and will lobby for such a role to be created.  ""We want this bill to go ahead with bipartisan support, so we are pushing for a bill that does what it says it is trying to do, which is to tackle modern slavery,"" Ms O'Neil.Keren Adams from the Human Rights Law Centre agreed the bill needed to be strengthened to force businesses to comply. ""Without financial penalties — and with no independent Commissioner to help enforce them — the new laws will lack the necessary teeth to make sure the worst offenders lift their game.""""The Government must urgently address the weaknesses in this bill and send a strong message to brands that profiting from abuse will not be tolerated.""The United Nations estimates 25 million people are exploited in global supply chains, including in the agriculture, manufacturing and construction industries, and about 4,000 of those are thought to be in Australia.Modern slavery abroad takes various forms. It can refer to people forced into prostitution, or forced to work for low wages in construction, sweatshops or food supply chains. They can be forced to work through threat of violence, bullying, or in more extreme cases they can be literally sold and bought, or have their movements restricted.In Australia, it manifests more commonly in the horticulture sector, particularly with backpackers who are underpaid, denied visa extension by their employers or forced to live in squalid accommodation.Mark Lamb, from the global peak body for procurement,  the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS),  said the laws showed Australia wass serious about addressing modern slavery locally and overseas. ""I think this is an excellent first step for Australia because we have already seen it implemented in other countries, and for Australia to implement this it is a great step forward,"" he said.""Understanding what goes on in the international supply chain is absolutely paramount and this really brings the issue under focus.""Do businesses actually know what's happening in their supply chain,"" he saidIn May CIPS released the results of its slavery survey, which found most procurement managers were ill-prepared for the new government requirements.In the survey, 45 per cent of procurement managers agreed the legislation was needed, but a quarter of all respondents were concerned it would ultimately have little impact.At the time of the survey, 20 per cent of organisations had not taken any measures to ensure a slavery-free supply chain, but 80 per cent said they were motivated to address the issue due to the reputation risk of ignoring it. Mr Lamb said these news laws would change that. ""When we have done research at CIPS, only 11 per cent of organisations have total transparency across their entire supply chains, whether its food or otherwise,"" he said. ""They often know who their tier one supplier is, but beyond that it is not well understood.""This act forces them to dig deeper and understand what is happening in their supply chain.""The Government said the legislation was not a response to recommendations by a 2017 parliamentary inquiry into modern slavery, whose recommendations were still being considered.

And if you Google ""notable exception"", Andrew Fifita's image might well pop up on the screen.Once this was because too many exceptions had been made for Fifita, whose conduct did not deserve the privileges his outsized talent afforded him.Back a one-punch killer, abuse the refs at a junior game, throw your considerable weight around too much and abandon your (previous) country on the eve of a World Cup and you might just get a reputation.Yet, for all that, the way is being cleared for Fifita's return to disreputable society — the pending State of Origin series.At the weekend a glowing story in the Sydney Morning Herald headlined ""How Tonga's World Cup campaign turned Fifita into a leader"" extolled the newfound maturity of a player whose only previous resemblance to Winston Churchill was around the waistline.Even when the more salient point seemed to be ""How Tonga's World Cup campaign turned Fifita into a Tongan"" given his new representative allegiance meant he was unavailable for Origin II when Tonga were scheduled to play the Pacific Test and so, presumably, ruled out of Origin action altogether.But there is a sudden complication. Fifita is in rare form. He carried the Sharks to victory in Canberra last weekend with an exceptional 80-minute performance and was almost as influential during a 22-16 win over the Bulldogs on Sunday.So you could hardly blame NSW, sniffing blood in the post-Thurston/Smith era, for being tempted to choose a human wrecking ball whose presence beside powerhouse forwards Aaron Wood and David Klemmer could finally tip the balance of power in their favour.But good form alone is not enough to justify Fifita's immediate return to the game's most prestigious stage after his World Cup betrayal.A narrative must be constructed that softens his image and even makes him a cause celebre.So we have Cronulla coach Shane Flanagan marvelling at the post-World Cup transformation of the Prodigal Shark: ""Andrew Fifita now understands who Andrew Fifita is,"" Flanagan told Fairfax Media.Who Fifita thought he was before this moment of enlightenment remains a matter of conjecture. Two-Pack Shaker? Matt Preston? Prince Harry?But it is Fifita's fascinating unpredictability that provides the greatest justification for his Origin selection. The elaborate and occasionally terrifying pantomime that is State of Origin needs a villain; someone to stimulate the cartoon book propaganda of the tabloids.Cameron Smith's retirement has robbed the Sydney media of its designated target. Gone with the great Number 9 are all the old jibes about his unfair influence on referees as well as the darker and far less justifiable taunts about his ""grubby"" conduct in the ruck.Given his still disputed residential status, Greg Inglis will no doubt be derided in Sydney as ""the first New South Welshman to captain Queensland"". But in the sublime way Inglis plays he seems somehow beyond a Smith-style character assassination.Fifita on the other hand is, like his Cronulla teammate Paul Gallen, the State of Origin villain from central casting.Even in the Queensland suburb of Melbourne where Origin I will be played, surely his abandonment of the Kangaroos' World Cup campaign would inspire the ire of the anticipated MCG crowd of 85,000.Fifita's notoriously loose lips would also make him an intriguing edition to this year's Origin. As far as the 28-year-old is concerned, there is ""no me in Mea Culpa"" and it is unlikely he would present for camp as a chastened figure.Of course the unpredictability that makes Fifita such a compelling Origin selection also makes him a high risk.The sample size for ""New Fifita"" is too small to remove those nagging doubts about his match day discipline and ability to conform to ""cultural standards"".To some Blues stalwarts, Fifita's post-game pledge on Sunday that he would play for NSW for free will still make him seem overpriced.Fittler said recently he still feels strongly about Fifita's decision to defect to Tonga, but also left the door ajar. So the image of the coach in that ante room with 16 names written on the team sheet and his pen poised remains irresistible.The NSW coach knows that should he ink Fifita's name in the squad he would be a villain. But when the dust settled, would that be in Brisbane or Sydney?","Australia, NSW, Rugby League, Sport, State of Origin, Tonga, ",2018-05-20 19:56:21+00:00

And it's a tool that we will be able to use.""Ms Mataele's father was a politician and a member of Tonga's elite, and her family has a close relationship with the country's royal family.In the documentary, Tonga's Princess Salote Lupepau'u Tuita describes her mother's relationship with a young Joey:""One memory my mother has is of when Joey was a toddler and he had very, very feminine features and really, really curly hair.So my mother had a life-sized doll as well and she said 'you're prettier than my doll' so she put the dress of her life-sized doll on Joey and put his hair in ringlets and would take him around.It was completely, it was you know, it wasn't to mock him or anything, she just loved it.Since then, he's always been that special and close to her.""Yet despite her connections in the upper echelons of Tongan society, her place within the community remains a struggle.While in some cases leitis are accepted as caretakers and workers, they are also outlawed, shunned and even face jail time.Tonga's Civil Offences Act criminalises cross dressing and sodomy, with both carrying jail terms of up to 10 years.Ms Mataele said people remained uncomfortable talking about the issue.""I think it's time to talk about it, we cannot be silent any more, I mean if we keep silent about this, it's not healthy, it's not mentally and physically healthy for all of us,"" she said.Leitis in Waiting culminates with a meeting organised by the Tongan Leitis Association, where the group publicly push for decriminalisation for the first time.The documentary's director and producer, Joe Wilson, said the dichotomy of Tonga's identity is part of what drew him to the story of the leitis.""It is probably the most religious country I've ever been to, which makes the story of how you work for change when it comes to how LGBT people are viewed very interesting and very challenging, but also very hopeful because in this case the Tongan leiti community is also very well integrated into their church communities,"" Mr Wilson told Pacific Beat.""So they're accepted on some levels but not on other levels.""The push for decriminalisation and the rising public presence of the leitis comes at a time of heightened religious tension in the country, with American-funded televangelists fuelling a new campaign against the LGBT community in Tonga.""It's creating an ugly division that I don't think had really existed in Tonga prior to the emergence of this kind of approach,"" Mr Wilson said.But Ms Mataele continues to be an avid church-goer, and won't be swayed from either her faith or her gender identity.""The more they preach against us, it doesn't really make me angry, it actually makes us all a stronger person,"" Ms Mataele said.""At the end of the day it's just a small island. You cannot move without anybody noticing and if they think they can move us out to little secluded islands, because of our sexual orientation or gender identity, I think they need to wake up.""In London for the premiere, Ms Mataele was awarded a Commonwealth Points of Light Award — an honour given by the British Government and endorsed by the Queen of England.The award commended her for, ""using song, humour and dance to promote issues which affect the transgender community"".While the award is not recognised in Tonga, Ms Mataele said she dedicated it to everyone who had helped ""fight this fight"".The new documentary will tour worldwide.","Community and Society, Gender Roles, Pacific, Social Systems, Tonga, ",2018-04-16 04:10:02+00:00

I saw it last week in Noosa, the beaches there are being eroded away, I see it in the Gold Coast as well. It's just a matter of time, but let's act now.""Tonga was lashed in February by Tropical Cyclone Gita, which flattened the country's parliament and caused extensive damage throughout the country.""People were throwing figures at me about climate change, and I said, 'All I know is that each year I walk out and I see the seas coming closer,'"" Taufatofua said.""There's more cyclones, and it's going to get worse, and we're such vulnerable little countries economically, and to rebuild after an event like this that's happening every year is just devastating.""Taufatofua's first Olympic appearance was representing Tonga in Taekwondo, and he surprised many when he set his sights on the snow.He had been learning Taekwondo since the age of five, but he started learning to ski before ever seeing the snow, using special rollerblades to train on roads and paths.  He said he now had his sights set on the ""magic three"" and would be announcing his bid for a new sport ""within the next two months"".""What I'm going to present is a sport that's much more aligned with being a Tongan, being a Pacific Islander, it's aligned with the water, with the sea. So wait and see,"" he told Pacific Beat.But whatever his next sporting goal is, he said it will not stop him fighting for more action on climate change.""I've never been a box sitter, I don't have four sides that confine me to what I can or cannot be. And I don't think anyone should,"" he said.""An athlete could be an athlete two hours a day, and then have 22 hours a day to think, and to do other things.

Yeah, absolute shock and disbelief.""The ban came just as the region's governing body, Oceania Rugby, was going out of its way to promote the women's game.In Fiji's capital, Suva, it was confirmed Oceania regional director of women's rugby Cathy Wong had been appointed to the World Rugby Council.On the announcement of Ms Wong's appointment, services manager for Oceania Bruce Cook reaffirmed rugby's popularity made it an ideal platform to raise awareness and promote gender equality in the Pacific.""When girls play rugby they transcend the gender limits set on females,"" he said.""World Rugby, and in turn Oceania Rugby, is committed to be a global leader in sport where women have equal opportunities in all areas.""Fairs said the latest move by the Education Minister had sent the development of the sport in Tonga into reverse.""Look at Fijiana, look at PNG, they are doing so well for themselves, and we're developing and we've done really well at previous Pacific Games,"" she said.""But just to go backwards and not have our young high school students playing, I mean where else are they going to build that skill level in order to compete at the highest level?""Tongan women's rights activist Ofa Guttenbiel Likiliki also criticised the rugby ban, which she said was a reflection of Prime Minister Akilisi Pohiva's own views, rather than those of the majority of Tongans.""He doesn't support young girls playing rugby, because it's his personal view that it takes away the dignity of girls who play it because in his view it's a male sport,"" Ms Likiliki said.""I do not believe that parents were consulted or had their personal perspective taken on board.""I think there should be an opportunity for them to speak, not just the parents, but the students themselves.""News of the ban has made its way around the world, with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern the latest to express concern, saying all young women should be allowed to play whatever sport they choose.The announcement has also raised a fierce online debate about whether sport and culture should mix, particularly in a country like Tonga, where women are underrepresented in politics, and domestic violence is rife.Fairs said if that situation is to change, banning girls from playing rugby at school will not help.""Taking away rugby only takes away their mateship, their sense of belonging within the team,"" the Wallaroo said.""There are so many women who play rugby at the moment, whether its rugby league or rugby union or any kind of sport, who are just outraged that such a decision has been made.""Hopefully the Government and the Minister will listen to the public and see that these young women are upset.

Dr 'Akau'ola told Pacific Beat.However, with many pools and reservoirs of stagnant water creating a breeding ground for mosquitoes, the risk of a dengue outbreak is one of several health challenges for authorities with 2,000 people still living in 30-40 evacuation centres.""We are focused on flooded areas because we know if there is going to be any vulnerability to contamination, it will be due to poor hygiene and of course flooded areas populated by people, they will be the most vulnerable,"" Dr 'Akau'ola said.""So we have drained some of the swamps to hopefully get rid of contamination.""It's not the perfect solution, but we're just trying to slow down the threat of contaminated water within communities.""Tonga Power general manager of operations Seti Chen said it will be more than a month before electricity is fully restored.He said 25 per cent of households on Tongatapu now have power, but more than 40,000 people are still without electricity, many of them on the outer areas of the island.""That was one of the first priorities was to get the water system running in these villages so through the National Emergency Disaster Office, there's been a lot of generators distributed and they've been working at getting the water pumps up and running,"" Mr Chen said.""Water now is becoming more consistent compared to last week.""He said linesmen were working around the clock, supplemented by 10 specialists technicians sent from Australia as part of the $3.5 million relief package.","Cyclone, Dengue Fever, Diseases and Disorders, Pacific, Tonga, ",2018-02-28 07:19:26+00:00

232,https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2018-01-24/meet-the-pioneers-in-the-war-on-waste/9329038,"On a single stretch of beach on Cape York Peninsula, volunteers spend four days collecting more than 7 tonnes of rubbish — 1,000 cigarette lighters, 2,280 toothbrushes, 3,320 plastic drink bottles, 5,500 thongs, miles of fishing nets.The year before, they collected around 3 tonnes. In a year's time, after fresh currents have pushed in from the Coral Sea, a new group of volunteers will come back to find the same stretch of sand blanketed in trash.Our remote northern beaches bear the symptoms of a global waste pandemic that many will understandably view as an insurmountable curse; efforts to clean it up, well-intentioned but ultimately futile.But a beach heaving with our plastic detritus can also look like an opportunity to Professor Veena Sahajwalla.The very concept of waste, according to Veena, needs to be completely revolutionised.""We've got to value [waste] as a resource. We really shouldn't have to send any overseas,"" she says.""It's an important thing to be prepared to not just see it as a problem but also to see it as a fantastic opportunity.""Veena's team at the University of New South Wales are developing micro-factories: small, modular recycling plants capable of turning a variety of waste into usable materials.Their micro-factories are capable of turning plastics into filaments: long strands that form the ""ink"" in 3D printers and can be moulded into anything from car parts and everyday household items, to hardware, tools and medical equipment.""We're looking at different types of waste plastics, it doesn't have to be the stock-standard PET bottles,"" Veena says.""E-waste [such as] printers for example, and things like CDs — all of these we have shown that you can convert them into filaments.""Growing up in Mumbai — one of the world's largest industrial centres, Veena developed a fascination with the things people discard.""Kids collect stamps, I used to collect rubbish — little glass bottles and little things that to me were like, 'OMG this is so cool!'""Her micro-factories are also being developed to produce metal alloys from e-waste such as circuit boards, and to reform glass, food packaging and textiles.""[The system] needs to be flexible enough at the micro-factory level and have different modules to process different types of materials,"" she says.The idea, according to Veena, is to enable recycling to happen on a scale that allows rural towns and communities to turn their waste into a valuable commodity.A community like Lockhart River or Bamaga in Cape York for example, might be able to harvest the tonnes of rubbish that wash up on their beaches and via a 3D printer, convert it into something of use.Harvesting waste and turning it into something that can be used locally or exported is a disruption to manufacturing, in a similar way Uber is a disruption to transport, or Airbnb to accommodation, according to Veena.""To me that is the ultimate empowerment — to be locally producing [materials] yourself,"" she says.""Let's be exporting the products out to the world … filaments are something that everybody in the world will be using as people do more and more 3D printing.""Her team are launching their micro-factories alongside industry partners later this year.Meanwhile, in Tonga, Phil Smith is coming at the waste issue from an entirely different angle.Phil's phone keeps dropping out mid-conversation, which he says is all part and parcel of living in Tonga.""The spinoffs for being a smartarse have been unbelievable. I just can't believe it,"" he says in between drop-outs.Running a successful whale-swimming business, Phil who worked for 38 years on a jackhammer in Sydney, was looking for a suitable building material to upgrade his own house and guest accommodation when he stumbled across the idea of building with plastic bottles.""A couple of photos just struck me — the finishes, how beautiful they were, I thought, 'Well, why not? There's plenty of rubbish around the place, plenty of plastic bottles, plenty of willing helpers',"" he says.Building with bottles involves filling them with a rammed mix of limestone dust and sand — made out of crushed glass — and then setting the bottles within a solid mortar mix.The resulting structure is said to be stronger than an equivalent brick wall, earthquake resistant due to the flex in the plastic, and has the added benefit of removing significant volumes of waste from the environment.But for Phil, the ecological benefits have paled in comparison to the social outcomes he says have inadvertently sprung out of choosing to build a plastic-bottle house.""A girl who's a very good environmentalist said to me, 'You're just an accidental environmentalist. You've done more for Tonga than anybody because of your smartarse idea',"" he said.Needing upwards of 100,000 filled plastic bottles for the walls of his building, Phil enlisted the help of local school kids, adding 60 cents per bottle to a fund which he used to buy them laptop computers for their classrooms.But as he began talking to principals and teachers, he discovered that there were some more basic items than computers that the schools were lacking.""We think it's funny coming from Australia, but all they wanted was a mower … because it was costing them 150 local dollars every fortnight to get the lawn mowed, and that was the principal's whole budget,"" Phil says.""In another school all they wanted was carpet. I couldn't find carpet, so their carpet's lino. Another school lost power to nine of their 12 rooms in cyclone Waka in 2002, so they haven't had power for 15 years. Now they have."" Once the kids saw the rewards they were getting for their hard work, Phil says they began clearing the streets and shorelines for rubbish, and entire family groups got involved as well.""There's one old guy in one group, he's a bit like a horse you'd put in the bottom paddock because he's too old to work on the plantations so he's just sitting at home,"" he says.""Now he's filling bottles. When I rock up he smiles, you see both his teeth shining. Even if that just gives him a year or two of that bit of self-worth, well that's fantastic to me.""When Phil dropped the mower off at the school, the principal organised a snap presentation.""The emotion of these kids, it was six at night, they rang the bell, all the parents and kids came along, they all sat down neatly at the front and then started singing songs,"" he says.""The town officers said a couple of prayers. The headmaster, he was crying making a speech just saying that the kids worked hard for this, they got blisters on their hands, they realised that they can work to achieve anything.""Phil's building will eventually have enough space for around 20 guests, a presentation room for workshops, and his own accommodation. He has so far stockpiled 35,000 bottles, and needs another 65,000 to complete the build.As well as the plastic bottles, he's imported a machine that crushes glass bottles into fine sand that he is using in the mortar mix. He estimates that he'll use around 400,000 glass bottles altogether.Although he is aiming to make the accommodation as near to 5-star as possible, he says a local custom is giving him some room for pause.""It looks directly at the King's house. When he's in town he can look down at my place and in Tonga law if the King likes it he can come and take it. So I just hope he doesn't like it too much.""When Martin Freney came across a bunch of books on earthships in 2007, he says the concept ""just made sense"".""I think it was the environmental impacts [of house building] that were a big issue for me,"" he says.Earthships are a building design that have struggled to take off in Australia due to strict building regulations.Pioneered by US architect Michael Reynolds, an earthship incorporates thick insulating walls usually set into a hillside, built from used car tyres filled with rammed earth.Internal walls are typically built from earth products such as mudbrick and with materials such as glass bottles inlaid. And within these, is a greenhouse where food is grown on recycled grey water, with passive solar and thermal systems providing heat and energy.In 2011, Martin headed to the US to study the thermal properties of earthships, comparing them to more standard construction methods as part of his PhD research. His findings convinced him that the innovative design is the direction that housing construction needs to take.Martin set about constructing an earthship at Ironbank in South Australia that could comply with Australia's strict building codes.He says he had to pick his way through building certifiers until he found one who was willing to do a bit of research.""There are different ways of achieving compliance,"" Martin says.""[We found] a private certifier that had the knowledge and resources and was interested in the idea [enough] to look into the national construction code.""Once he found the right certifier, he says getting the building to comply was relatively straight forward, but he ran into trouble with his grey water system.Although Martin initially had the system pumping into the greenhouse, council ordered it to be removed over health and odour concerns.""I was foolish enough to brag about it in a newspaper,"" he says.Despite the compromise, Martin says his resulting earthship, which is now run as a bed and breakfast, has remained true to the principals of sustainable design.""People are coming and enjoying it and experiencing it and, overwhelmingly, they want one, or they don't want to leave.""","Air Pollution, Earth Sciences, Environmental Health, Environmental Impact, Ironbank, Land Pollution, Mining Environmental Issues, Recycling and Waste Management, Science and Technology, Sydney, Tonga, Water Pollution, ",2018-01-23 19:06:26+00:00

Tonga sends 2000 workers a year to work in New Zealand, where there are Liaison Officers to help them adjust.Ms Akau'ola said appointing Pacific Island Liaison officers in Australia early in 2018 would help provide safe avenues for complaints to be heard.""We have two liaison officers in New Zealand, and that's what we're doing for Australia - they should be on board by the beginning of next year.""Vanuatu's Government supports widening the scheme to get more people to work in Australia.Earlier this year, a judge fined labour hire contractor Emmanuel Bani $227,000 for harsh exploitation of 22 ni-Vanuatuans on farms in the Sunshine Coast, during 2014.Sue Jenkin who grows and exports mandarins at Ironbark Citrus, Mundubbera Queensland and employs 150 people in a year said a third were permanent local, a third were backpackers and a third were Pacific Islanders.She has also set up a citrus farm for the people of Laos.She said Tongans, Papua New Guineans and workers from Timor Leste were the backbone of her farm.""For us we would never want to go back to a time before the Seasonal Worker Program,""  Ms Jenkin said.""Some of our workers have just arrived this weekend. This would be their eighth trip out to work for our orchard.""They know our orchard, they know our town, they know the job, they want to work six days a week because they want to earn a lot of money.""That means for us, we can get the job done, efficiently and effectively.""It's awesome, plus they're our friends.""Ms Jenkin said the farm owned three houses in Mundubbera to accommodate the workers, employs a cleaner for each house which only has four or five occupants.She said they are looked after with medical care, visits to doctors or specialists.The Mundubbera community was surprised to hear the reports of mistreatment of Pacific Island workers in their town.Faye Whelan the deputy Mayor of North Burnett Regional Council, hosted a meeting in December with local farmers, the Salvation Army, members of the Tongan community and Growcom.Cr Whelan, as Chair of the Mundubbera Social Cohesion Committee said they had identified some issues that they would be addressing.""We're ever vigilant and I would ask any member of the community to come forward if they know something is not right with our visitors. She said the region had workers coming back year after year.They're very important to us,"" Cr Whelan said.""I have these big burly Tongan workers come and give me a big hug, and say ""I'm back"".""We like to treat them like family. They are wonderful singers at events.""She said her message to people who thought they could exploit workers — ""Don't do it because we'll catch up with you!"" she said.As a softer approach, the Mundubbera Community Garden for Tongans, will also be open to seasonal workers to grow their own food and discuss any problems.Salvation Army's coordinator of the Freedom Fund Alison Rahill said the Department of Employment must crack down on agents charging illegal recruitment fees, and ask questions such as 'Are they in debt back home to somebody who has perhaps lured them here with the promise of good pay?'""""Australia is a country of great opportunity and it's very easy to go into a village where people living in poverty and promise people fruit-picking visas in Australia, earning hundreds of dollars every week, Ms Rahill said.In a statement to the ABC, the Department of Employment said the Seasonal Worker Program was strongly supported by local farmers and none of the participating countries had indicated to the Government they were concerned or wanted to stop.The statement said none of the 12 deaths that have been reported on had been found to be work-related.It said the leading cause was vehicle accidents, outside the workplace or pre-existing health conditions.""Given the leading cause of death is from car accidents, the Government is partnering with the Queensland Police to trial road safety awareness, targeted at seasonal workers.""""We investigate all allegations of worker mistreatment received … and take non-compliance very seriously.""""As a result of monitoring and compliance activities in 2016–17 we suspended five approved employers and terminated one in relation to serious non-compliance.""The Australian Government has made recruitment fees, paid by Pacific Islanders to agents, illegal. However the Salvation Army alleges they were still being paid, and workers arrived already indebted.""The Australian Government is aware of allegations where seasonal workers have been asked to pay a fee to join the program and is working with partner country governments and Labour Sending Units to address this issue,"" the statement said.

Because where there is water, particularly hot water, and rock, the opportunity for microbial life to spring forth is commonplace here on Earth,"" he said.""This is the lifestyle of an island evolving in space and time, and we study these to understand Earth, and to extend that understanding to Mars.""","Earth Sciences, Pacific, Science and Technology, Space Exploration, Tonga, Volcanic Eruptions, ",2017-12-13 21:12:32+00:00

The 37-year-old has been sitting on his dream for about seven years but is now actively taking steps to make it into reality.""It's all about helping our communities and helping our young kids get on the right path to wherever they want to be,"" he said.""Sport is only 10 per cent of your life, the other 90 per cent is before and after,"" he said.""We want to give all the young Tongan kids the skills and knowledge to be able to make the most of their career before, during and after sport, so when they finish their career they have something to fall into.""Currently Kite, Finefeuiaki and the team are in Tonga meeting with members of parliament and discussing ways to work together to realise the initiative.

''The Fairtrade minimum price gives us a good price to sustain our operation when prices collapse or drop.

What's coming through here is some sort of a dictatorial answer to the problems that he's facing,"" he said.""The media are just doing what their jobs is, to report what's happening and it's interesting that during his time in opposition he was relying on the media to get his message across, and now that he's in the position of running the country he doesn't feel that media should still do the same thing.""The ABC is seeking comment from the Tongan Government.In March Mr Pohiva told the ABC's Pacific Beat program the TBC was government property whose main task was to support state services.""That doesn't mean that we stop Radio Tonga from scrutinising government services but they must do it in a proper way, in a way which is impartial, independent and without malice and hatred,"" he said.""There's a difference between public property, Radio Tonga and Television Tonga, and independent paper[s].""Aggrieved by some of the state broadcaster's coverage of his government, the Prime Minister has called for them to be shut down or sold off.There have also been fears about the future of Vanuatu's state broadcaster, the Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation, after team leaders at the network were handed redundancies last Friday.""This is one of the government organisations that is not making money so that is why they have decided to cut down the number of staff and for that reason they have to go to the redundancy,"" Vanuatu government media spokesman Hilaire Bule said.The main role of the organisation was to make profit and it must learn to stand on its own legs rather than relying on government grants, he added.""The survival of the media, like the print media and audio, it is advertisement and if you cannot make good stories and good programs, well the business cannot advertise,"" Mr Bule said.For Papua New Guinea, the picture is mixed this World Press Freedom Day, with a couple of recent complaints from publications to the country's media council over government interference clouding a four position improvement in the rankings to 51.The president of the PNG Media Council, Alexander Rheeney, said while there remained plenty of threats to journalists holding power to account, social media had significantly improved access to news for Papua New Guineans.""There is more variety in terms of news content now so it means more competition,"" he said.""And more competition at the end of the day means having a variety of news content for Papua New Guineans and Papua New Guineans having to choose what news they want to consume.""The big Pacific success story of this year's World Press Freedom Rankings is Samoa, which shot up eight places to number 21 to become the best performing small island country, sitting close behind Australia and New Zealand in the Oceania region.Keni Lesa, editor of the Samoa Observer, said he wasn't surprised by the result because Samoan journalists are free to report on anything but stressed the quality of that reporting remained an issue.""The value issue for me I see, the quality of information that's going out because sometimes it's kind of hard to get information and even when you get information, you really have to wonder about the correct information,"" Mr Lesa said.Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi had been a hero of press freedom and was incomparable to some of the other more autocratic leaders in the Pacific.""Everyone in the media in Samoa knows that if you want to talk to the Prime Minister, he'll be available. He has a weekly media program where he talks to anyone and everyone,"" Mr Lesa said.","Asia, Community and Society, Fiji, Fundamental Rights, Information and Communication, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Print Media, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, ",2017-05-03 07:56:35+00:00

251,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2016-10-12/how-migrant-workers-are-critical-to-agriculture/7922368,"More than 900,000 immigrants on permanent and temporary visas enter Australia each year. Most live and work in Australian capital cities, and immigrants are more urbanised than the average Australian today.However, in the past decade or so, new visa pathways have opened up to attract new immigrant workers and their families to the Australian bush. Increased chances of selection attracts permanent skilled immigrants to accept employment in regional and rural towns.At the same time, increasing numbers of temporary migrants on working holiday, student and skilled 457 visas are attracted to the bush. A new program for Pacific Seasonal Workers has also been introduced.With that, immigrant workers add substantially to productivity in the agricultural industry, a new report reveals.For policymakers, the attraction of getting migrants to rural areas is that it helps reduce labour shortages — particularly during seasonal harvesting peaks — and counteracts the trend of population movement away from the bush to the metropolis.Immigrants, including refugees, play a critical role in the Australian agricultural industry. Some of these immigrants become entrepreneurs, opening up a business. Skilled immigrants in the agricultural sector were also much more likely to have set up their own business (15 per cent) than those in other industries (9.6 per cent).When set against the Australian average rate of entrepreneurship (those in the workforce who are self-employed or employers) of 10 per cent, this propensity for immigrant entrepreneurship in the Australian agricultural sector is very encouraging, since entrepreneurs drive employment and productivity growth in the industry.457 visa skilled workers find employers in the bush eager to sponsor their immigration application, particularly in professional and technical occupations. Working holiday makers fill critical jobs during harvesting and picking seasons.Seasonal workers from the Pacific are eager to supplement the income of their families back home via remittances. They also get to learn new skills.Immigrant farmers fill the growing intergenerational gap in farm succession and bring with them new technologies and innovations to Australian farming.For example, Zimbabwean immigrant Nicky Mann and her husband introduced hydroponic rose-growing at their NSW Central Coast operation. Vietnamese and Chinese market gardeners have introduced many new vegetables to expand Australians' food horizons.Australia takes in about half of all working holiday makers who enter OECD countries. They can work and travel around Australia from job to job. The carrot is a 12-month extension to their visa if they work more than 88 days in the bush. The agriculture, forestry and fishing industries receive the greatest benefit from this arrangement.Working holiday makers come from more than 20 countries. The UK, South Korea, Ireland, Germany, Taiwan and France provide the largest numbers. Fieldwork with Korean working holiday makers found the majority arrived with the intention of working in the agricultural industry.Most reported that the best thing about their experience was that they had good relations with the non-Koreans they worked with in Australia, learned new skills, had to opportunity to improve their English, and received good wages.The Pacific seasonal workers program allows workers from East Timor, Nauru, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu to work in low-skilled jobs for up to seven months in a 12-month period. Most work in the horticultural industry.The annual intake has grown from around 400 in 2010-11. It is now an uncapped, demand-driven immigration stream that has expanded to jobs in the broader agriculture industry — including the accommodation sector.Many permanent and temporary immigrants in the bush, particularly those who work in the agricultural industry, report receiving a warm welcome. This undermines existing stereotypes.Many skilled permanent immigrants report strong local connections through sporting, community, school and religious social activities in their regional, rural and remote towns.Those who work in the agricultural industry report a higher level of social engagement — with the exception of sporting activities — than do other immigrants.However, working holidaymakers had more than three times the rate of finalised Fair Work Ombudsman complaints compared to all other workers in 2013-14. This suggests a high incidence of exploitative work arrangements.The research also noted numerous examples over time of exploitation of temporary migrants on temporary student, skilled work, working holiday or Pacific Seasonal worker visas. Examples of co-ethnic exploitation are also common.The research does not clarify the extent to which temporary migrants working in agriculture experience exploitation. However, experiences of migrant worker exploitation do jeopardise future migrant flows into agricultural jobs.International migration decisions are often based on the experiences of friends and family around the world. This means that unscrupulous employers can undermine the benefits of migrant employment programs for the majority of Australian employers who provide appropriate pay and work conditions.Jock Collins is the Professor of Social Economics at UTS Business School.Originally published in The Conversation.","Agricultural Policy, Australia, China, Community and Society, Farm Labour, Federal Government, Immigration, Kiribati, Nauru, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Vegetables, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, ",2016-10-11 20:12:34+00:00

But for Polynesia we have an absolute date by which it must have occurred which is 1,000 years ago.""At that time, the population started moving out from Tonga and Samoa to the eastern Pacific Islands of Hawaii and Tahiti, then 700 years ago travelled south to become the Maori population in New Zealand.""When they leave 1,000 years ago that mixture has already happened.""But more work with ancient DNA from skeletons of different ages would be needed to clarify exactly when the mixes happened in various locations, Professor Spriggs said.Commenting on the study, director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA Professor Alan Cooper said the paper provided a lot more information about the Pacific and Polynesian origins ""that was just conjecture before"".""It clarifies this whole issue of how you get two groups of people together to form another one that does the most amazing voyages,"" Professor Cooper said.He said the study also raised questions about when the Papuan mix happened in Tonga and subsequently in Polynesia, whose people today have 26 per cent Papuan DNA.""The Tongan individual carried little or no Papuan ancestry providing confirmation the ancestral population of Polynesians was not yet fully formed or widespread by the end of the Lapita,"" he said.""So how long before [the Papuans] catch up?

driven by the desire to expand markets for its cheap consumer goods rather than any geopolitical imperative.But others see Beijing's bid for influence as an emerging threat to regional security, playing out as it does against the backdrop of Washington and Beijing's strategic rivalry and China's military build-up in the South China Sea.It is a dynamic that Canberra will have to confront as it re-evaluates its Pacific policy as part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's just-announced foreign policy white paper.And navigating China's emergence as a key player in the Pacific throws up a broader — and long-standing — foreign policy dilemma: how Australia charts a course between strategic ally Washington and economic partner Beijing, as the global balance of power shifts from West to East.""We've seen a very significant and steady growth in recent years in both directions and the trade shows that the Pacific Islands can benefit from the growth of China,"" David Morris, the Pacific Trade Commissioner in Beijing, told Pacific Beat upon the release of the latest trade statistics.By any measure, it is an extraordinary leap: two-way trade between China and the islands reached $US7.5 billion ($9.9 billion) in 2015, up from $US4.5 billion in 2014, driven by a doubling in the value of Chinese exports.It lends some support to the view that Beijing's primary motive in the region is economic: to secure markets for its products and, in turn, access to the region's rich natural resources.And it does not necessarily translate into a greater strategic threat, the Lowy Institute's non-resident fellow Jenny Hayward-Jones told the ABC.""Many Pacific Island Countries, like Australia, are in the position of having China as their primary trading partner but not their primary strategic partner,"" she said.""And as is the case for Australia, increasing Chinese economic (and in the Pacific Island countries' case, aid) influence does not mean Pacific Island countries have to switch their strategic allegiances.""They can get what they want from China without moving into China's strategic orbit.""The Lowy Institute has just updated its groundbreaking research on the extent of China's aid program, tracking more than 200 projects worth $US1.8 billion since 2006.China is now on track to overtake Australia as the largest aid donor to Samoa and Tonga, having already claimed the status of lead donor to Fiji.Crucially, China's aid spending often comes with ""no strings attached"", in contrast to the strict governance criteria imposed by Australia — often a source of irritation to Pacific governments, who can see the demands as patronising.China also funds much-needed infrastructure like roads, bridges, schools and sporting facilities, where Australian aid programs tend to focus on supporting broader political and economic reforms.""I think we all know now is [Australia's] role in the Pacific is being challenged by [the fact] China's frankly cashed up and it's spending its money pretty freely across the South Pacific,"" Cameron Hawker, an analyst with the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and a former Coalition adviser, told Pacific Beat.""You only need to visit Fiji and other countries to see stadiums and all sorts of government buildings going up — and clearly 'Made on China' signs on it.""China has opened its wallet for projects big and small — from $US175,000 worth of quad bikes for Cook Island MPs to a $US25 million grant to build PNG's Western Pacific University in the Southern Highlands.But Lowy research fellow in the Melanesia program, Jonathan Pryke, cautioned against drawing too close a comparison between China and Australia's aid programs.The bulk of China's aid comes in the form of concessional loans to fund large infrastructure projects, he points out, which is a ""narrower form of engagement"" than that offered by Canberra.According to an analysis by ANU and Lowy, the loans typically offer a five to seven-year grace period and then an interest rate of 2 to 3 per cent over 15 to 20 years, and are as much about securing market access for Chinese companies as helping recipient nations.Examples include the $US74 million finance for the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone in PNG's Madang — to develop better fish processing infrastructure — on the condition that the project is built largely by Chinese companies and labour.""I don't think we should panic ... It is certainly a large amount of money but ultimately this is a good thing for the Pacific,"" Mr Pryke said.""It democratises further their access to international finance and it allows them to engage with new partners. There's still great need for finance in the region.""But it should give Australia and conventional donors a moment of pause.""We should really be reflecting on how much longer can we maintain that position of being the partner of choice in the region when China doesn't have the same stringent requirements of safeguards and quality and reporting that we might demand.""Also, their objectives are a lot more opaque to begin with.""And while many Pacific nations have welcomed Beijing's largesse, the loans have not been without controversy in recipient nations — often contributing to a growing debt burden.In Tonga for example, external debt to China represented nearly a third of its gross domestic product by 2011.China agreed to defer repayments after the International Monetary Fund warned Tonga was at high risk of debt distress — but when repayments start again in 2018, they will reportedly be even higher than before.""A lot of the smaller island countries, because these are concessional loans, are really at their limits of how much debt they can take on board,"" Mr Pryke said.""Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu are already facing varying degrees of debt distress.""And they have learned that reaching into China's deep pockets comes with other risks, Lowy's Danielle Cave wrote in her analysis of China's latest aid spending.""The Chinese Government ... is just doing what all governments do — engaging internationally to promote its own interests,"" she said.""But those interests don't always benefit Pacific partners — debt distress, local business frustration, poor aid management, aid quality complaints and high-level corruption are some of the issues that have arisen from China's style of foreign aid delivery in the Pacific.""China's economic expansion in the Pacific is just one plank of its ""Going Global"" strategy, which has actively encouraged state-owned enterprises to invest abroad.But the more hawkish observers have long seen more at play than just a pursuit of economic gains.For years, China so-called ""chequebook diplomacy"" in the Pacific was driven by its rivalry with Taiwan, which has been formally recognised by six Pacific states.But as tensions have eased under Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou's leadership, so too has neutralising Taipei's influence become less of a priority.Today, long-time China-watchers like Australian National University Professor Hugh White say that while Beijing is clearly driven by its economic interests — the larger strategic threat cannot be ruled out.""China clearly does seek to become at least a leading power in the Western Pacific and perhaps the leading power in the Western Pacific,"" he said.""One of the things it would naturally do as it moves towards that goal is to cultivate a closer political and even strategic relations with all the countries in the region including the smallest and in some ways the most remote.""The concern appeared to be echoed in Australia's 2016 Defence White Paper, which warned that instability in the South Pacific ""could have strategic consequences for Australia should it lead to increasing influence by actors from outside the region with interests inimical to ours"".ADFA analyst Cameron Hawker also warned against complacency.""In a sense we probably take the Pacific somewhat for granted,"" he told Pacific Beat.""The only other major foreign power that obviously operates at will in the Pacific is the United States, which is very much to our advantage.""But we tend to take it for granted that no hostile power will act in the space and if a hostile power were to act in that space it would definitely be a threat to Australia.""In 2014, China and Fiji signed a memorandum of understanding between their military forces when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Nadi, vowing increased defence cooperation.But Jenny Hayward-Jones said she was not convinced Beijing was likely to replace Australia and its allies as the region's primary security partner.""On the strategic side, we have seen China exercise caution, with naval visits — fewer than those of Australia and New Zealand — focused on medical ships that deliver special health care to Pacific Island residents, military aid generally of the non-lethal variety and no attempt — as yet at least — to establish naval bases,"" she said.Certainly, she said, Beijing was seeking greater diplomatic influence, but it has not translated into the outcomes it might have hoped for.She noted that Vanuatu was the only Pacific Island nation that has backed China's position on the South China Sea.""Fiji, which is otherwise close to China, and PNG have been very cautious in what they have said and not toed the line that China would have expected.""This is important because those two countries are the most significant in terms of the size of their economies and population and because they have military forces.""Nevertheless, Beijing's growing presence in the region has not gone unnoticed by Washington, which has sought out greater engagement with the island states as part of President Barack Obama's much-vaunted foreign policy ""pivot"" to the Asia Pacific.Mr Obama arrived at the 10th Pacific Island Conference of Leaders meeting in late August bearing gifts: a $US30 million aid package to help deal with the impact of climate change.The leaders in turn passed a resolution declaring that they ""are backing the US foreign policy rebalance towards the Asia Pacific while proposing to reinvigorate awareness of Pacific issues in Washington"".Professor White said the US State Department was keenly aware of the need to strengthen its ties with the island states.""There is a clear concern in Washington that an improvement in China's position in the South Pacific, and an enhancement of its political and strategic standing there, would be a negative for Washington because in the end between the US and China it's a zero sum game,"" Professor White said.He cited then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton's attendance at the South Pacific Forum in 2012 as a ""pretty unusual step"", showing the Pacific was firmly on the US radar.More significantly, Professor White believes Washington may have been behind Canberra and Wellington's 2014 detente with Suva, ending the years of sanctions that followed Fiji's 2006 military coup.Australia and New Zealand's withdrawal had left a diplomatic vacuum which China was only too happy to occupy, and Fiji's military regime was adept at using Beijing's open arms as leverage against its larger neighbours.When Mr Xi visited Nadi in 2014, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama couldn't resist a veiled dig at Australia and New Zealand, praising Beijing for its non-interference in the country's internal affairs.""From Fiji's point of view, they could see an opportunity in China's interest ... to put pressure on Australia and New Zealand, to remind [them] that countries like Fiji have options, they don't just have to deal with the world through us,"" he said.""I would be very surprised if there hadn't been quite close discussions between Washington and Canberra about the management of the Fiji issue.""Meanwhile, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull took the opportunity at this weekend's Pacific Island Forum meeting to reiterate Canberra's commitment to the region, flagging a ""new Pacific strategy to be considered by ministers later this year"".He promised an extra $80 million to help the islands manage the impacts of climate change, and said his presence should ""underline Australia's long-term commitment as a major and reliable partner on strategic, security, economic and development issues"".Cameron Hawker believes Australia should trade on its natural advantages when it comes to its relationship with its Pacific neighbours.""Australia offers a much broader range of engagement than China possibly can,"" he said.""Whereas China can splash around a lot of money, Australia is not acting by itself. It's also with New Zealand and other like-minded countries and we have a range of soft power options at our disposal.""And Professor White said that engagement in the Pacific should not prove too difficult for as long as the strategic rivalry between China and the United States — heightened by the Hague rejecting Beijing's claim to most of the disputed waters in the South China Sea — can be contained.""But if [it] really intensifies and that's not a very remote possibility — we are seeing a pretty clear pattern of intensification at the moment, over the last few years and even months and weeks — if that trend continues, then the stronger China's position in the South Pacific becomes, the more potential problems that poses for Australia and New Zealand.""","Australia, China, Fiji, International Aid and Trade, Pacific, Samoa, Tonga, United States, World Politics, ",2016-09-10 07:11:19+00:00

There have been Zika outbreaks in the Pacific region over the past few years, particularly in French Polynesia and Vanuatu.Samoa, which reported its first transmission last November, has been added to a list of more than 20 countries where transmission of the virus is ongoing. Scientists suspect that when Zika strikes a pregnant woman, it can cause her baby to be born with microcephaly, or an abnormally small head.Dr Reynold Ofanoa said Tongan health authorities were monitoring pregnant women for signs of infection.""We're working with obstetricians ... to identify any cases of pregnant mothers who present with symptoms of Zika to be tested ... and also to follow up their pregnancies until delivery.""This week the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the spread of the virus a global emergency.A number of drug companies have since announced that they are working on a vaccine for the virus.An Indian biotech firm claimed to have developed a vaccine for Zika, but says it will not be available for a few years without help from the government and the UN health agency.

Prime minister Akilisi Pohiva said the kingdom's financial position was at an unsatisfactory level and it might be impossible to prepare well for it. In a televised national interview, Mr Pohiva said Tonga wanted to ensure that it delivered a Games that was of regional and international standard, but he said the country would have to raise funds from donor partners to deliver. The Pacific Games Council also expressed concerns that Tonga was almost two years late in preparing for the Games. Ahongalu Fusimalohi, vice-president of the Tonga Amateur Sports Association and National Olympic Committee, said he was not sure the games would go ahead given the current level of planning and preparation. ""I'm lost for words,"" Mr Fusimalohi told Radio Australia's Pacific Beat program. ""We had a plan — seven years of fundraising and seven years of planning to 2019.""The politicking in Tonga has been quite unprecedented with regards to the Games."" He said the people involved in the original planning for the Games were not allowed on the committee.  ""We had plans for business franchising and how we can generate that revenue without even touching on taxes,"" he said. ""The new committee took another two years to do a new plan.""Mr Fusimalohi said it was a question of time and money that was needed to get the infrastructure up in time for the event. ""If we do get the money, can we actually make it by 2019 to have all this infrastructure up? And that's three years from now,"" he said. ""Tonga cannot not afford to host the Games. If we don't host the Games, Tonga will not in the foreseeable future, ever get the Games back.""Papua New Guinea, the host of the 15th Pacific Games underway in Port Moresby, will hand the baton to Tonga on Saturday.

Pacific Beat's Richard Ewart takes a seat to watch a fearsome encounter between New Caledonia and Samoa at the Pacific Games.All the ingredients were there at the Bisini Complex in Port Moresby: skill, flair, courage, and above all passion. The match between New Caledonia and Samoa was played at high speed, in hot conditions, and to my eyes revealed that women's soccer has gone to another level in the Pacific.New Caledonia is the regional powerhouse, the silver medallist from four years ago, and in Christelle Wahnawe they have the best player in the region.Mele Soakai ... She's only 15, and she's scored a goal in senior international football. For me that's a big thing.Samoa, on the other hand, came to the games with no such reputation, but they took it up to 'Les Cagous', twice taking the lead and then holding on for a 2-2 draw with some gutsy defending late in the game.""We made history in our first match, defeating Tonga, and now we've done it again with this result,"" said Samoa's captain Rosei Leota.Samoa's dramatic improvement is no coincidence because while investing time and money in their young players at home, they have also gone in search of overseas-based players, with South Auckland player Leota.While approval of her participation in the Pacific Games is not universal, coach Tala Salamasina said for now, at least, bringing in the expats is the way forward.""I'm very, very, proud of my team. We're here for a reason, to win a medal,"" she said.""We have good development in Samoa, but we need the involvement of the overseas players to take that next step.""Leota and her fellow expats in the Samoan team are very proud to be involved.""It's a privilege for us to be able to represent our little nation, Samoa, and showing the local players there is more to football than just playing other Pacific teams.""But the Samoan policy is not for everyone, with Tonga's coach Lui Muavesi pointedly remarking ""that most of their players are New Zealanders"" when referring to the Tongans' defeat by their Pacific rivals earlier in the tournament. Tonga has opted to take a different path, relying on experience laced with youth, including some players who are still at school.In their 2-0 win over Solomon Islands it worked for them.Coach Muavesi says it demonstrates why women's soccer is catching the eye of more and more spectators.""My players' skills are almost on a par with the men, and people know that.""As for Tongan captain Penateti Feke, she has seen it all before at the Pacific Games, and is very happy to see youth get its chance. ""Especially when the second goal was scored by the youngest player in the team, Mele Soakai,"" she said.""She's only 15, and she's scored a goal in senior international football. For me that's a big thing.""Whichever way you look at it, women's soccer in the Pacific is making progress, with an Under-20 World Cup on the horizon (to be hosted by Papua New Guinea) and spectator numbers rising.And if anyone should suggest that the women's game lacks physicality, or that the players don't go hard enough, then they should have been sitting next to me as the drama unfolded in the battle between Samoa and New Caledonia.","New Caledonia, Pacific, Samoa, Soccer, Solomon Islands, Sport, Tonga, Women, ",2015-07-09 05:23:56+00:00

Glorious and majestic and a blessing to all the Tongan people,"" said one of the new king's people.""The whole atmosphere was wonderfully happy with the best singing one can find anywhere in the world,"" said another.Tonga's pro-democracy prime minister, Akilisi Pohiva, has long advocated for less royal involvement in politics, but said the king is an important figurehead.""We love our king we will continue to maintain our monarchy from now on until the future,"" he said.Retired Australian Methodist minister D'Arcy Wood was flown in to perform the crowning.""No Tongan citizen can do it as it is forbidden for a Tongan to touch the king's head,"" the 78-year-old retired minister told Pacific Beat before flying to Tonga from his home near Melbourne.Celebrations and ancient rituals leading up to the coronation began last Saturday with a taumafa kava, a traditional ceremony in which Tupou VI drank the mildly narcotic kava to confirm his title as king of Tonga.The historic rite, in which about 150 nobles, wearing traditional ta'ovala mats around their waists, sat in a circle to drink kava from coconut shells, launched seven days of street parties, black-tie balls, fashion shows and feasting before the king was crowned by Mr Wood.Mr Wood was born in Tonga, where his father worked in 1924, and met the new king when he was Tonga's High Commissioner to Australia in the 1990s.Tonga's monarchy can trace its history back 1,000 years, and by the 13th century the nation wielded power and influence over surrounding islands, including Samoa, nearly 900 kilometres to the east.Tupou I, who converted to Christianity after coming under the influence of missionaries, was proclaimed king in 1845 after winning control of the monarchy from two other royal lines.By 1900 the country had become a British protectorate and acquired its independence in 1970.The reign of the new king's brother, Tupou V, saw a six-year reign that introduced major reforms that expanded democracy in the nation of about 110,000 people.ABC/AFP","Melbourne, Pacific, Royalty, Tonga, ",2015-07-04 08:22:46+00:00

I would have liked to have stayed longer but the fishing boat had to pick me up on the way back.""Mr Stuart brought some water with him, but there was none on the island.To get around this, he improvised a water capture system out of a plastic sheet and a rubbish bin.The unstable nature of the island — which scientists say may disappear at some point — also caused problems. ""I was on the seaside and I got washed into the sea because the ground gave away under me,"" Mr Stuart said.""Luckily, I managed to crawl my way out. I don't swim either.""I've spent my life in places like the Kalahari Desert, the Belgian Congo, single sailing — anything where there's a bit of excitement.On the first few nights, he said he spent the night in a cave on the island.""It just had one entrance [but] after four or five days, it had two entrances.

""I think in some ways the intergenerational nature of violence is intuitive: we as children mimic the behaviour of the adults,"" she told Radio Australia's Pacific Beat program.You would think that during a time of pregnancy, there would be some protection of women from violence, but what we find is that's not the case.""So the child that grows up in a household where violence is a normal way of dealing with stress and conflict, and will grow up to mimic that behaviour as they get older.""

The full extent of damage is still unclear as the storm, now downgraded to category three, moves away from Tonga and out into the open ocean.The huge storm, described as the worst to hit Tonga in decades, slammed into the northern islands on Saturday before moving on to the main island overnight.Houses have been flattened, roofs blown away and trees and power lines brought down.  The Governor of Ha'apai, Tu'i Ha'angana, has visited the area and says the damage is so bad, he can see from one side of the island to the other.Ha'apai is home to about 8,000 people and is popular with tourists.Tonga's director of emergencies, Leveni Aho, has told the ABC he has serious concerns for those islands in Ha'apai where communications have been cut.""The picture comes to hand now, it was really bad,"" he said.""I think it was 70 per cent of the housing of the two islands that we have access to now have been affected - destroyed or partially damaged.""We have got some people sheltered in some of the evacuation centres, buildings and some of the churches.""Mr Aho says there is still no communication with 80 per cent of the Ha'apai group of islands, including the main island Lifuka which bore the brunt of the storm.Residents there were reported to have huddled in churches for shelter as houses were destroyed in the cyclone.Ian Wilson, a New Zealand emergency management official, said Lifuka was in Ian's direct path.""Whatever was on the island has been damaged, whether it's buildings, crops, roads or infrastructure, it's all been damaged,"" he said, warning that it remained difficult to get a detailed picture of the destruction.""There is no communication, we did have a satellite phone but that also died.""It is serious, the eye of the storm went right across the top of the island.""

She says female politicians in Australia face nothing like the difficulties that women in public life have to contend with in the wider Pacific.""Hearing...aspiring female candidates in Solomon Islands and how they get into a canoe in order to go door-knocking in their communities - and how it makes our door-knocking opportunities seem somewhat less fraught,"" she said.""We were usually most scared about dogs nipping at our heels, or voters who vehemently disagreed with us - it's a very different circumstance if you're a female candidate in some of these countries.""Whether it's literally weathering potential violence or threats, or dealing with corruption levels that mean women are automatically disadvantaged, not only because they don't have the money to run campaigns, but they don't have the money to pay off officials.""The group of 30 women from across the Pacific which met in Tonga came up with strategies for boosting female political representation in their countries.Initiatives such as mock parliaments and mentor programs are designed to give women a better understanding of politics and parliament.Ms Stott-Despoja says the proof of progress on boosting participation comes when the countries go to the polls - as Fiji will next month.""Women from Fiji - be they aspiring candidates or civil society reps - are very concerned about the prospects for election for women,"" she said.""On the other hand too, they're putting up their hands, they're running for parliament, they're getting trained, they're educating themselves about the processes.""So there's small progress being made, but we'll wait and see how some of those elections that are due to unfold...pan out.""We've had the vote for more than 100 years - these women are dealing from much lower bases.So it's worth acknowledging that their rate of progress may seem slow, but it's quite extraordinary.The Pacific Women's Parliamentary Partnership Project is a 10-year initiative that partners Australian and New Zealand women MPs with Pacific female politicians and aspiring candidates to improve representation across the Pacific.We've had the vote for more than 100 years - these women are dealing from much lower bases.So it's worth acknowledging that their rate of progress may seem slow, but it's quite extraordinary.Ms Stott Despoja says she and other politicians should be inspired by the struggles and successes of their Pacific counterparts.""We've had the vote for more than 100 years - these women are dealing from much lower bases - some countries have only had independence in the last 20, 30, 40 years - so it's worth acknowledging that their rate of progress may seem slow, but it's quite extraordinary,"" she said.""When you couple that with the obstacles - be it employment issues, be it patriarchal cultural issues, and of course omnipresent violence against women and children...you realise women have got some barriers to deal with.""When they overcome those it's terribly inspiring, and I think female politicians and aspiring politicians could learn a lot from these extraordinary efforts.""","Australia, Pacific, Parliament, Tonga, Women, ",2014-08-13 01:47:12+00:00

""My concerns for the show would be how do you take these kids, put them back into their own communities, and back into their schools particularly, and make people believe that this is not the true depiction of what they're really about,"" he said. ""It seems to normalise something that's a really minute percentage of the community. Once you start to normalise that ... people then pick up on that. ""[Tongan children] will then start mimicking all these roles at school and think it's okay to do what Jonah from Tonga has done on TV.""

""If it was a Tongan actor playing the role ...  in the Tongan community, then they would get the laughs and they would understand what crosses the border and what doesn't cross the border,"" Mr Latu said.

""There will be serious misunderstandings if the position isn't clarified.""He says another issue that could be considered unfinished business is the abolition of the special electorate for nobles.Nine seats in parliament are reserved for nobles, and Dr Powles says they have been a powerful voting bloc since the 2010 elections.""One thing that hasn't been changed... is the special privilege that nobles have where it comes to constitutional amendment that affects their rights,"" he said. ""And there are limitations on the amendments procedures where that is concerned. ""So these are matters which are still there [and] the extent to which they will bubble up in the next election is anybody's guess.""Dr Powles says there is little possibility of changing other laws is limited in that the king can veto legislation.""It is a veto which is seldom used,"" he said. ""It is kept in reserve and people are by and large not too concerned about it but if the community becomes more divided and these issues become more stark and obvious, the question of how the king deals with legislation that is put before him to assent to or veto could become very important.""","Constitution, Elections, Government and Politics, Pacific, Tonga, ",2014-05-01 01:41:27+00:00

""But we have to see it in a positive light. They're in a better place now. We can feel some sort of comfort from that. That's part of the healing process,"" she said.""But we are human too.

She resisted. But after they died, she did audition.""The two boys had actually told me about it,"" Ms Lale said. ""They were showing me American versions of The Voice that year and telling me to audition when it comes to Australia. I said, 'No, I'm not that type of person.' I just like singing here and there - live. Live is what I do.""""I couldn't do that year because they'd just passed. I had to build up for the next year. I made it through the auditions.""Ms Lale said her ultimate goal was just to get on the stage.""I was so highly emotional before I went on because I was so proud of the boys,"" she said.  ""My family was there - my cousins from Brissie flew up - we were all crying before I even went on, before we even left the hotel. I couldn't stop crying. I only did it because of these two.""On night of the fire Ms Lale says was desperately trying to contact them.""When it came to that moment I was messaging them, trying to call their phones. You don't know how many messages I left on Lale's phone that night because I couldn't believe it. I was like, 'Call me back! Call me back now!""The family still does not know exactly why the house burst into flames.""We're still yet to receive, even two years after, a final statement of what really caused that fire.""Ms Lale said the tragedy had changed her.

China is also donating two new Y12 aircraft, which also have a troubled safety record, to help boost Tonga's domestic air services.Tonga's Minister for Transport Samiu Vaipulu has told Pacific Beat both aircraft are safe and believes some reports on the issue have been inaccurate. He says the record of air accidents in 2012 shows that only two MA60s were involved in accidents but they were runway-related, adding that the problems were with the operation of the aircraft and not the aircraft itself.Since 2009, MA60 aircraft have been involved in 11 incidents, with most of the crashes caused by technical or system failures.In June, Myanmar grounded its MA60 planes for safety checks after two crash landings.The New Zealand government issued a travel advisory earlier this year for Tonga, saying that people using the MA60 should do so at their own risk.Despite this, Mr Vaipulu insists that the planes are safe and says it is being singled out by New Zealand.""The question is why don't they give the travel advisory to other nations?"" he said.""About 20 of them using the MA-60 and only do to Tonga?""Mr Vaipulu says he has told the New Zealand government to check the plane and tackle their concerns.""I've told them that they have permission from China to come and check it in China,"" he said. ""But they are doing it to us, why not the other 20 countries using the MA60?""""We've done everything according to IAT rules, and that's how we got to this stage.""The MA60 has been flying 3 months now, and there's been no problem at all.""New Zealand which also suspended millions of dollars in tourism aid to Tonga, says the MA60 plane has been involved in a significant number of accidents in the past few years and is not certified to fly in New Zealand, Australia, Europe and the United States.Mr Vaipulu says Tonga is being targeted due to personal interests.""Maybe they have some interest with the previous airline that was providing us domestic air service,"" he said.New Zealand-run company Chathams Pacific pulled out of Tonga's domestic airline market after it was announced that Tonga would be receiving the Chinese-made Xian MA60 and introducing a Chinese-run service.Chathams Pacific officials said they could not compete against a subsidised service, especially in such a small market.""But they pulled out themselves. They did not want competition but we want competition for the benefit of our people,"" Mr Vaipulu said.The two new aircrafts will help Tonga boost domestic travel and security.""It will take our people to the two Niuas which is very expensive now to go (now)... and also use it for our surveillance of our territorial waters,"" he said.","Pacific, Tonga, Tourism and Leisure Industry, Travel and Tourism (Lifestyle and Leisure), ",2013-11-13 02:20:32+00:00

Professor Grant Schofield from the Auckland University of Technology conducted research on the food habits of several Pacific countries including Tonga, Tokelau, Kiribati and Vanuatu.  He told Pacific Beat that this trend in Vanuatu is really interesting as many are benefiting from the consumption of traditional foods due to a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrates. ""The problem is to try and stop them developing the same problems that... the Pacific has started to develop, which is as soon as you start to develop and urbanise and change your food then everything goes quite badly wrong,"" he said. ""Once you start to add... sugar, they all go badly.""Across the Pacific, diabetes prevention is high on the public health agenda.While people have heard the familiar advice of having a low fat diet, Dr Schofield himself has experimented with a low carbohydrate, high fat diet.He says he has not only lost weight but also, noticed his general wellbeing improve.""The advice that we've been giving in most developed countries is that things like coconuts are very high in saturated fat and of course everyone knows that saturated fat is bad for you,"" he said. ""But it just doesn't play out that way in these traditional food cultures.""Dr Schofield says it was back in the 1980s when the benefits of high fat traditional diets in the Pacific were recognized. The problem arises when refined and processed carbohydrates are added to the diet.Dr Schofield says a high carbohydrate diet works for the Chinese and Japanese cultures where rice is a staple in their diet.""My observation is that Pacific people don't do well on those sorts of carbohydrates,"" he said. ""The Pacific population has really been eating a good quality protein and a relatively high fat diet coming from plants for most of the time the Pacific's been around. ""Whereas (if) you go to Japanese and Chinese populations, they've been eating rice for thousands of years.""""So they're quite different. But all those countries once you start to add the third thing which is sugar, they all go badly.""Trials are now underway in the Pacific community in New Zealand where obesity and diabetes are a growing concern. ""What you see is contrary to what the regular health advice is, which is like you're too fat, you need to exercise more and eat less and you particularly need to get your fat down,"" Dr Schofield said.""We've gone for the opposite approach which is just reduce the sugar and refined and processed carbohydrates, but make sure you do get some fat and protein and those sorts of traditional foods. ""And you see quite a good deal of success.""Dr Schofield cautions that a high fat diet does not mean more fast food.""People hear high fat and... all of a sudden they're down at McDonalds or the Kentuckey Fried Chicken,"" he said. ""That particular type of diet's got a special name, that's called the Standard American diet, it's high in fat and sugar and that ends very badly as we know.""He advocates that people in the Pacific are better off following a traditional diet. ""If your grandmother or great grandmother would recognise it, eat it,"" he said. ""If they wouldn't have eaten it just forget about it. ""So as soon as you start to think about a traditional diet, don't worry about this fat and what's in the food so much, but just think about what's been around 100 years ago and that's the path to health.""","Diet and Nutrition, Food and Cooking, Health, Pacific, Tonga, Vanuatu, ",2013-10-30 23:56:47+00:00

""Being the first generation in America, you grew up poor because there are no connections...so you start from the ground up"".His parents worked several jobs to make ends meet and his older siblings started working when they were in their teens to support him and the family.Growing up in economic hardship, Ta'u became aware from a young age that excelling in football would give him an opportunity to go to college. ""I started when I was ten, eleven years old...but in the back of my mind, I knew that if I wanted to go further in life and in my education, I had to stick with [football],"" Ta'u said. ""The only way that I was able to attend college was through sports, through football, and that's what I did, and that's how I went through life."" Ta'u was accepted into Weber State University in Utah on a full football scholarship during which time he was drafted to the NFL to the Cleveland Browns. He later went on to play for the Baltimore Ravens.""I was very blessed to (be able to) continue on my journey from college to the NFL,"" he said. After his football career was cut short by injury, Ta'u's singing talent was discovered by Dame Kiri te Kanawa who gave him his first break.""I approached her with CDs and DVDs that I had of hers and wanted her to sign it, and she looked up and saw me. In New York, when you see a Polynesian person...you click, you come together and become a family, because we are so far away from our homeland,"" Ta'u said. ""So when she looked up and saw me, she automatically knew that I was Polynesian and asked me what I was doing in New York. I told her that I live here and I am trying to pursue a singing career. ""Right off the bat, she knew that this was a hard life and she asked me if I had any help. I said no. And she said, 'well, can I help you?' I said, 'yes, please do.'""Seven months later, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa took Ta'u Pupu'a to The Julliard school of performing arts. After a series of auditions, he was offered a four-year scholarship to study as a tenor and became Julliard's first Polynesian student and first Polynesian graduate. ""Ever since then, [Dame Kiri Te Kanawa] has been my mentor, she has been a wonderful angel in my life. A lot of what I have now is because of her,"" Ta'u said. Do not let your dreams die but continue on living your dreams.And if that one door is closed, many more doors will open.Ta'u believes it is his faith in his talent that has allowed him to overcome the obstacles for such a dramatic change in his career path. ""A news reporter said it must have taken a lot of courage to move to New York. I said to the news reporter I had no courage, the only thing I had was faith,"" Ta'u explained. ""I moved to New York with faith, courage came later."" Despite all the struggles he has faced, Ta'u continues to encourage others to pursue their dreams and not to give up.""Do not let your dreams die but continue on living your dreams, and if that one door is closed, many more doors will open.""","American Football, Arts, Culture and Entertainment, Music (Arts and Entertainment), Opera and Musical Theatre, Pacific, Sport, Tonga, United States, ",2013-05-29 00:16:53+00:00

Dr Steven Ratuva is about to begin compiling a handbook on the subject that he hopes can be used to resolve conflict.The political sociologist at the University of Auckland has received a $A460,000 grant for a major research project about Pacific regional security issues.The project will involve several researchers.He told Radio Australia's Pacific Beat he will look at case studies involving Fiji, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands and Tonga.""There has been an assumption that the Pacific is all the same: 'arc of instability', 'failed states',"" says Dr Ratuva, using common labels.  ""In fact the Pacific is very complex,"" he said.Those four nations faced quite different security situations and became useful studies to seek solutions.Fiji had seen ethnic tension; Tonga a struggle involving the structure of society; an independence struggle in New Caledonia; and internal divisions in the Solomons. He noted that Australia and New Zealand had also seen internal security issues and violence.""One cannot really generalise.""But, said the researcher, there was ""also a whole lot of goodwill"" which has sustained Pacific communities through trouble. The key was to find those ""building mechanisms"".""There's been a whole lot of focus on conflict and not so much on the conflict resolution mechanisms, the building mechanisms, which have been responding to those issues for centuries"".","Community and Society, Defence and National Security, Education, Fiji, New Caledonia, Pacific, Race Relations, Solomon Islands, Tonga, University, Unrest, Conflict and War, ",2013-01-25 00:38:31+00:00

424,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-07/an-pacific-mental-health/4248400,"A study published in March this year found big differences in mental illness rates between Pacific island youth born in New Zealand, and young Pacific migrants. When Tongan psychiatric nurse Sione Vaka began digging into those findings, he found what's now the focus of his PhD - the cultural disconnect between how the Western mental health sector defines disorders like depression, bipolar syndrome and schizophrenia, and the way these conditions are understood in Pacific communities. ""There's a fear to it in terms of schizophrenia and bipolar but they look at it as more possessed by the spirit or disobeying some of the cultural values that are there, so it is quite a bit different in some ways,"" he said. ""If you talk to someone about schizophrenia they'll respond to you in some Tongan concepts and say 'Oh that's what we call in Tonga avanga' which is a bit different to schizophrenia.""Mr Vaka is studying New Zealand's Tongan community, but says his findings could help inform the mental health sector's engagement with Pacific communities in any western country. Partly - and not surprisingly - that means ensuring good support for people used to getting help from extended family. But it also means helping family members accustomed to seeing mental health through a Pacific lens to understand what diagnoses like depression or schizophrenia mean, with all that entails for treatment and management.""It's informing health providers to understand and accommodate the need that our Pacific people are having with mental health and I mean maybe expressed in terms of family involvement and all those sorts of things, to accommodate those needs that are there,"" he says. ""If you talk to someone about schizophrenia they'll respond to you in some Tongan concepts and say 'Oh that's what we call in Tonga avanga' which is a bit different to schizophrenia.""As a male nurse who speaks fluent Tongan, Mr Vaka is a rarity in New Zealand. He was one of the first men to study nursing in 1993 when gender rules were relaxed... because he thought it'd be a good way to meet girls. Now though he says there's an urgent need for more bilingual mental health professionals - especially men.""That's one of the challenges that we have - if we try to educate them about some mental health concepts we have to translate it. For example the word depression itself there is no direct translation in some Pacific languages about that illness so we have to discuss it in a way that our people would understand and explain it using much more simple things,"" he explains. ""So it is a big challenge in terms of language, trying to teach our people those things as well.""Mr Vaka wants to encourage more people of Pacific Islander descent, particularly men, to take up the study of nursing. He says there are benefits aside from meeting members of the opposite sex - his self-confessed original reason for studying nursing.""That was the initial intention and the wrong reason,"" he says. ""Throughout nursing I managed to see that there were areas that were very helpful in terms of helping our Tongan and Pacific men who have issues that they are not comfortable discussing with female nurses. ""The opportunities are there in terms of jobs and we know that our Pacific people have high numbers in unemployment. I just want to encourage men to take up the opportunity. Not only are there a lot of employment opportunities but you're able to make a big difference for our community in terms of the health of our people.""Mr Vaka teaches Pacific and Mental Health at Manukau Institute of Technology in Auckland - it's one of two such courses in New Zealand. It's a nursing course designed with Pacific islanders in mind - both as practitioners, and as patients and clients. Psychiatrist Siale Foliaki - Clinical Director of Pacific Mental Health Services for Manukau district - says he'd like to see many more Pacific islanders enrolled on the course - especially men.  ""For example the Pacific service in particular where I work we've got a good balance of males and females but we've recruited specifically to address that situation,"" he said.""But if you were to look at primary care for example, where the majority of people are presenting, there would be very few male mental health trained staff in a primary health setting, and in an NGO setting - the non-government setting - there are much fewer males. But you know the hospital system has recognised that and we've taken productive steps to address that.""""New Zealand born Pacific Island young people - are much more enthusiastic about a career in mental health""Dr Foliaki says the need to entice Pacific islanders of both sexes into mental health and allied services is very much on the policy radar - as part of broader initiatives in New Zealand, and Australia, to boost investment in mental health. But he says it'll be easier to recruit would-be students in Western countries. There are still deep stigmas associated with mental illness in the Pacific, and Dr Foliaki says these extend to studying psychiatry and mental health. ""When I first started doing this clinic in 1994 I was doing some community work as a very junior doctor. I was involved in setting up a community-owned primary health organisation. So we set up a GP clinic that was free for people to come and visit. I knew that with my interest in psychiatry and my training in psychiatry - there were patients who didn't really want to see me in a GP context because they felt that they would be singled out for some discrimination and stigma associated with having me as a health professional.

Having said that I think over the last decade young people in particular - New Zealand born Pacific Island young people - are much more enthusiastic about a career in mental health.""And he's welcomed Sione Vaka's research as a valuable step in demystifying mental health - saying it'll be valuable for the entire region and its six-million inhabitants.""The work that Sione is trying to attempt to do is trying to get traditional Tongan concepts of mental disorder and trying to marry that in a meaningful way that enables us to conceptualise our problems in a way that people seek appropriate help.

Stand-off Ki Anufe duly converted it.Then lock Faatiga Lemalu went over for Samoa's second try with Anufe cashing in on the conversion, giving Japan a 16-14 lead at half time.A penalty from Anufe in the 43rd minute put the surging Samoans in the lead for the first time at 17-16.Some more poor Japanese defence allowed Samoa to penetrate deep and Lemalu powered over for his second try of the day, as Japan wilted badly.Smelling a Samoa victory, right centre Lolo Lui took over the kicking duties for the visitors. He made no mistake with the conversion as Samoa led 24-16.Anufe then scored his second penalty to extend the lead to 27-16 in the 65th minute.The Japanese, needing a try to stay in the game, nearly closed the gap as a good run by right winger Toshiaki Hirose was stopped just short of the line.Samoa lost its own line-out and Kikutani finished off with a try in the corner in the 68th minute, but it was too far out for Nicholas Ryan to convert.Nine minutes later, Hirose made no mistake, the captain finishing after a period of sustained pressure to go over in the corner and put one point between the sides.

Under current eligibility guidelines and criteria, Feleti qualifies for Australia under birth status. He also qualifies for Tonga under his father's birth status, England under his mum's birth status and in September 2013 he will qualify for New Zealand under residency status. The Australian Rugby League Commission (ARLC) from November 2011 will now decide which team players are eligible to play for (including New South Wales and Queensland Origin and City-Coutry Origin) with players answering five questions to assist the ARLC process. These questions are:These questions will help the ARLC decide that Feleti Mateo is eligible for City Origin and New South Wales Origin representation.The ARLC has also implemented a similar process to assist in the decision making process for eligibility of the impending under-20s Origin fixture. It's a step in the right direction.Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) have the onerous task of eligibility in the international arena. This is very difficult but currently eligibility can be determined by player birth place, parents' birth place, grandparents' birth place as well as residency. Each case must be treated on its own merit... it is not just black and white as some would suggestAdd to this, during a period between World Cups (currently this is 2008-2013) players can change their allegiance once. This week James Tamou has highlighted the RLIF challenge with eligibility, but each case must be treated on its own merit as many of our players have multiple eligibility possibilities. It is not just black and white as some would suggest. In my opinion, rugby league has a big international eligibility and selection problem for the developing nations who want to participate in international rugby league. Developing nations are all nations who participate at the international level outside of the Australia, New Zealand and England.The eligibility for international rugby league is not significantly different from other world sports, but rugby league is essentially controlled by England, New Zealand and Australia. The current eligibility guidelines are detrimental to the developing nations as the player selection pool is severely limited as the big three dominate international destinations of players. Most NRL player contracts include bonuses for international representation of the big three, revenue streams are light years ahead and clubs in both hemispheres frown upon developing nations fixtures in the off-season as it impacts upon their rest period (the big three play their fixtures in this same period too).I have been associated with club, big three and developing nation (in my case Samoa) rugby league utopias. I have spoken to Nigel Vagana - a passionate Kiwi and Samoan representative who has a solution which fits rugby league.Tier 1 - Australia, New Zealand and EnglandTier 2 - Others (eg Samoa, Tonga, France, PNG, Russia, Lebanon, USA etc)Guidelines:I understand it's not easy for clubs to swallow that players may be injured playing for developing nations, but they are insured.

Here, Dorney looks back on his meeting with the colourful and sometimes controversial monarch:Back in 1996, I began a weekly column for Papua New Guinea's English language newspaper, The Independent, with the following tongue-in-cheek boast:""The crown prince of Tonga, His Royal Highness Prince Tupouto'a, had me over to dinner at his place the other night. ""Nice little place, the royal villa. It's brand new, palatial, cost a whispered 3 million Tongan Pa'anga (over $1 million) and stands at the end of an 800-metre driveway, grandly positioned on the top of what much be the highest ground on the island of Tongtapu, Tonga's main island.""I have to confess I was not the crown prince's only guest. There were about 93 of us - all delegates to the Pacific Islands News Association's annual conference.""In actual fact, the crown prince, now the late King George Tupou V, did invite me and several others to sit at his table. That was thanks to my great colleague, Robert Keith-Reid, publisher of the Fiji-based Islands Business, who was a personal friend of Tupouto'a.Robert had a wicked sense of humour - fortunately matched by his royal friend.As we stood in the marble-columned foyer of the Royal Villa sipping wine, Robert asked Crown Prince Tupouto'a: ""How much longer do you think your father’s subjects will continue to put up with such an ostentatious display of wealth?""I almost choked.""The Crown Prince laughed good-naturedly at Robert's question about possible subject anger at his palatial lifestyle and a few minutes later,"" I wrote in my column, He guided us into his ""luxurious private dining room"".Crown Prince Tupouto'a became King George Tupou V 10 years later in 2006, on the death of his father, who had reigned for more than 40 years. His reign lasted just six years. King George died in Hong Kong at the weekend, aged 63. He had cancer and had not been well for some time.In that short six years, he brought profound change to Tonga, moving it to being a far more democratic state. He surrendered significant power to the parliament and announced that in matters of state he would henceforth rely on the advice of the elected prime minister.In the 2010 elections, a majority of the members (17 out of 26) were for the first time elected by the people. Prior to that the ""commoners"" were allowed to vote for only nine MPs out of the 30 who sat in the old parliament. Twelve were appointed directly by the king, who also chose the prime minister.The common factor between the old and the new parliaments is that there remain nine noble MPs. These nine are elected by the holders of Tonga's noble titles.The king was a bachelor and so the next king will be his younger brother, crown prince Ulukalala Lavaka Ata, who is at present the Tongan high commissioner in Canberra.Much has been written about the eccentricities of King George.But my memory of him is of an incredibly intelligent man, a voracious collector of interesting objects, and an absolute devotee of technological change.Back in 1996, in his address to the Pacific Islands News Association conference in Tonga, he spoke about the possibilities for the media in the Pacific of what we now call broadband.""Perhaps technology will offer the journalist the new lease of life he most needs,"" he said. ""In the past few years I feel that several developments have come to the fore which should be very significant in the journalists' world."" He spoke about the AT&T Corporation developing ""a very fast modem that could transfer digital data at 1.0048 MB a second on a single copper wire simultaneously with voice telephony without interfering with the telephone signal"".""This, I feel,"" he told us, ""is particularly significant for the Pacific Islands press, who lacking viabilities of scale tend to oscillate between viability and a hard place"".""For the first time, because the customer pays for his newspaper when he dials it up on cyber-space, small newspapers will be free from being at the mercy of the advertisers.""Sixteen years ago, this was thinking far in advance of almost anyone else in the Pacific at the time.But his best line from the speech was when he came to talk about how he would deal with journalists who upset him in the new cyber age.""The public can hardly lynch the editor any more,"" he said.""But all is not lost. Because with cyber-space comes cyber-vengeance. ""If I see an article which particularly offends me on cyber-space, I know that as a member of the public I am free to download 2,000 copies of War and Peace directly to the e-mail address of the offending editor.""The passing of King George is a great loss to the Pacific.","Human Interest, Royalty, Tonga, World Politics, ",2012-03-20 02:07:54+00:00

He says the main reforms have been in the police development program.""They're about things like ethics and integrity, they're about technical capability and public order response, they're about transparency and being open with the public, they're about integrity,"" he said.""In other words, ensuring that our staff comply with the law like anybody else and actually provide a safer community - a safe and free environment - for people to live and work in,"" he said.""I think, without doubt, there's been an acknowledgment by all staff, by all members of the Tonga police, that change needs to occur.""It's very hard to gauge what the level of acceptance is and there is a difference between acknowledgment and acceptance. In most cases I've found good acceptance [and] in some cases reluctance - in one or two cases an almost blindness.""This is a long-term process, without doubt. I'm not so naive as to think that I could come in here, fix everything and then drive off into the sunset. That's ridiculous.""That all sounded fine, but I wanted to see for myself how this was working at street level, so I arranged to ride along in a police car on what turned out to be a rainy Saturday night.I was hoping I would get to ride with a tough 20-year veteran detective who had seen it all and would talk like a character from CSI.But it turns out reality is not anything like what you see on TV.We drove all over Nuku'alofa and, to be honest, very little happened. It turns out my American TV cop shows totally lied to me. Mind you, it was kind of fun just being in a police car.Now, there were a couple of incidents; this was Saturday night after all.About five minutes into our patrol, a call came in that members of the public had seen some kids drinking beer down by the wharf.We arrived at the wharf and saw some movement. I could sense things were about to kick off. Two of the policemen got out, approached the kids, and said: ""Hey you kids, don't drink beer at the wharf.""So the kids left.Later on, we got another call - some kids were at a dance at Queen Salote Hall and some of them were seen drinking beer. Once again, it was all on.Once we arrived at the hall, we saw some kids hanging around outside. None of them were drinking beer. One of the policemen asked them if they had been drinking and they said no, they had not.So we left and went back to the station.The rain-slicked streets of Nuku'alofa on a Saturday night were clearly not going to provide me with a chance to write a Pulitzer Prize-winning essay about the exciting work of crime fighting.I spoke to Detective Sergeant Latu Lavaki back at the central police station and he told me that as Tongatapu is an island and most people are pretty law-abiding, most crimes are committed by a very small number of people.""Most of the crime that is reported on the phone, some people, they come straight to the station,"" he said.""We get a lot of reports here.""Detective Sergeant Lavaki says working with a small community means police can often identify those responsible for crimes quickly.And he says living on an island makes tracking certain crimes, like car theft, relatively easier.""We work together with the traffic division ... but probably we will take an hour [to find the car], because this is an island [and it's] easy to get it,"" he said.Detective Sergeant Lavaki was clearly a calm, thoughtful man who wanted to protect and serve the people of Tonga, which was something of a shame as I was kind of hoping he would turn out to be a maverick, a loose cannon who played by his own rules and who told his captain he did not care if the mayor was breathing down his neck, he would get results his own way and to hell with proper procedure.In the whole time I was in Tonga, there was not a single shoot-out with bank robbers, there was not a high-speed car chase.The guy in charge did not even take off his sunglasses in slow-motion and make an amusing remark.I was starting to get the impression that crime fighting in Tonga was, in fact, nowhere near as glamorous or exciting as it looks on TV. I was feeling a bit cheated, so I took my complaint right to the top - Commander Kelley.""Hopefully it's an outfit that can respond to the things you've described, but the fact they didn't occur is good because that tells me we are having some effect,"" he said.""Tonga, in my experience, is a relatively peaceful and safe place. It does have its ... normal or routine crime rates and occasionally it has incidents which are spectacular.""Those incidents come along [and] I think the public have an expectation that we'll be prepared to respond to that in a confident and capable manner, and that clearly was the issue in 2006, and I don't want that to be the incident again.""","Law, Crime and Justice, Police, Tonga, ",2010-12-30 05:52:00+00:00

Most were Tongans but a number of expatriates were also among the dead.The Princess Ashika was an interim vessel, bought to keep the operation going until a new vessel is delivered from Japan in October this year.But it was unsuitable for the operation it was involved in.The three commissioners who conducted the inquiry say it was scandalous that such a maritime disaster could have been allowed to occur and that it was the result of a range of systemic and individual failures.They said buying the boat when its design was unsuited for services in open seas was wrong, buying it when it was clearly unseaworthy and unsafe was wrong, and allowing it to go to sea was wrong.At the heart of it, they say, was a failure to have independent due diligence conducted on the vessel.The commissioners are damning about the failure of those in authority to exercise their powers adequately or properly.They say they are not going to recommend that criminal charges be preferred against any individuals, although they note the police have begun criminal proceedings.They lay out in their report a range of possibilities as to why people should be charged.Much of the blame has been pointed at the nation's former transport minister, Paul Karalus.The commissioners say he made unsubstantiated and inaccurate statements to the king, the legislative assembly, the cabinet, the prime minister and the minister for finance.They say if Mr Karalus had properly carried out his duties and responsibilities as the minister, the Princess Ashika would never have been purchased.","Accidents, Disasters and Accidents, Maritime Accidents and Incidents, Tonga, ",2010-03-31 23:13:00+00:00

The growers looked elsewhere for workers and of the 100 visas made available for Pacific workers, just 56 were filled.It was hoped that many of those delays could be avoided this year to allow more growers, and Pacific Islanders, to take advantage of the 2,400 visas now available as part of phase two of the pilot.But Paul Kiley, the resources manager with All Recruiting Services - one of the three Government-approved labour hire companies - has told Radio Australia so far that has not been the case, despite negotiations with growers.""We've been looking since August-September and would have liked to have workers in the fields now, but none of the workers have agreed to our rates,"" he said.The cost of hiring a Pacific Islander is one of the reasons growers say they have been reluctant to take part in the pilot.As the employer, they are required to pay half the return airfare - about $800 - plus an additional $100 in transport costs.Once the Pacific Island workers are in the field, they cost $1 more an hour than the legal rate for local workers to cover the cost of administration.The additional cost seemed more reasonable two years ago when growers were facing a serious labour shortage.But that situation has now changed.Kris Newton, the chief executive of the Horticulture Australia Council, says there has been a decrease in demand for labour, mainly because of the global financial crisis, and there are more travellers keen for work in Australia.""So demand has remained high but supply is also high and is quite reliable. We were certainly thinking when the 800 initial visas were announced that it wasn't enough. In retrospect it was probably about right and we'll struggle to fill that this year,"" he said.Mr Kiley says there is more to the fall-off in demand for Pacific Islanders than the global recession or even this year's drought.""There are people on working holiday visas that are working more than holidaying, there are people on student visas working 40 hours and there are people on visitors visas working who shouldn't be and those people get paid well and truly below the awarded rate of pay,"" Mr Kiley said.The Australian Government has been holding regular meetings with labour hire firms, and says it is committed to getting the pilot off the ground.A spokeswoman from the Australian Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations confirmed that they have just issued a fresh request for expressions of interest for growers.Meanwhile, the three Pacific countries signed up to participate in the pilot say they have not yet been approached for workers this year.Vanuatu's Labour Commissioner, Lionel Kaluat, says it is unfortunate but says they were aware of the terms of the scheme.""It's disappointing but... it's a market driven scheme,"" he said.","Agribusiness, Agricultural Crops, Australia, Kiribati, Rural, Tonga, Vanuatu, ",2009-11-26 07:21:00+00:00

But that aircraft cannot land on the island, so it has to be ferried by boat.The Tongan community are still quite shocked by what has happened.They are very grateful that the major towns and cities in the country were not hit because it is a very low-lying country.But they feel very badly for those people who are caught on the island and cannot get off.It is a very tight-knit and religious community, so the churches are coordinating a big response.They are poor people here themselves, but they are all giving food and clothing to the churches to hopefully get onto that French frigate as soon as possible.","Disasters and Accidents, Earthquakes, Tonga, Tsunamis, ",2009-10-02 04:34:00+00:00

It's nature giving you a warning,"" he said.Dr Gibson estimates that the tsunami would have taken 20 minutes to reach the islands of Samoa and American Samoa.Reports from American Samoa say waves of up to three metres washed onto the island, causing widespread destruction.Authorities have confirmed that the tidal surge killed 28 people across the islands, but they fear the final toll could be as high as 100.After the earthquake, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre issued a tsunami warning for South Pacific nations, including New Zealand, which experienced a rise in sea level of 40 centimetres.Dr Huilin Xing of the Earth System Science Computational Centre at the University of Queensland says that while the tsunami warning system worked well, it has its limitations.""The problem is that there were a lot of false alarms, because not all large earthquakes can generate a tsunami,"" he said.""From research we know we can expect that if an earthquake is larger than magnitude 6.5 there may be a tsunami, but this is not directly or linearly related to size.""Currently no single model can model the whole process of an earthquake and its triggered tsunami generation.""This means we really need to keep looking deeper to work out what kinds of earthquakes can generate tsunamis and how big the tsunami might be.""Dr Ray Canterford of the Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre at the Bureau of Meteorology says no tsunami warning was issued for Australia.But he adds, ""This morning's tsunami is a reminder of the terrible force that can be unleashed by earthquakes under the sea.""","American Samoa, Australia, Earth Sciences, Earthquakes, Geography, Geology, Tonga, Tsunamis, ",2009-09-30 06:17:00+00:00

Kennedy caught a line-out, threw to Care and backed up the scrum half to collect a reciprocal pass and score.The Islanders then enjoyed a lengthy spell of pressure, with Armitage twice making important tackles as the driving rain made handling difficult.England, though, finished strongly as Armitage again cut through two tackles to pave the way for Mears to score his first try on his 26th appearance and Sackey got his second in the corner despite almost being decapitated by Semisi Naevo in the process, a tackle that earned the Fijian flanker a yellow card.""I thought our back three were outstanding, Delon played with real assurance, he's been doing it in training and we hoped he could do that and he did,"" Johnson said.

They have a lot of skill. It could have gone either way but we became strong at the end,"" said Wilkinson.""I still need to improve. But if you had told me this morning that we would win by a few points and qualify for the quarter-finals, we would have taken it.""But we still have a long way to go.""Even before kick-off the intensity of this match was made clear with England eyeballing their opponents as the Tongans went through their traditional pre-match challenge.But it was the Pacific Islanders who took a ninth minute lead when fly half Pierre Hola kicked a 45-metre penalty after England wing Mark Cueto had held on in the tackle.However, minutes later Tonga infringed and Wilkinson made no mistake with the easy chance to level the scores.Tonga though deservedly scored the game's first try in the 17th minute.Sukanaivalu Hufanga's searing break inside the 22 saw him brush aside tackles from Cueto and Sackey. Despite Olly Barkley doing his best to cling on, the outside centre went over for a try which Hola converted.Tonga, thrashed 101-10 by England at Twickenham in the 1999 World Cup in the teams' only previous meeting, then saw their advantage cut within minutes when Wilkinson's cross-kick was held by the diving Sackey as he slid over the line.Although Wilkinson missed the conversion from wide on the right, Tonga were now just 10-8 in front.England, thanks to a poor Tonga clearance kick and a knock-on, then enjoyed a sustained spell of pressure in the underdogs' 22.But they wasted scoring opportunities when hooker George Chuter knocked-on and Barkley missed a close-range drop-goal.Wilkinson, whose drop-goal secured England's victory in the final four years ago, showed Barkley how it should be done with a 31st minute effort that put his side a point up.England's next score came out of nothing when with Samoa just yards from the champions' line, Hola's pass was dropped by wing Tevita Tu'ifua.Sackey collected the loose ball and ran the length of the field for a try which put England two scores in front even despite Wilkinson missing the difficult conversion.Wilkinson, early in the second-half, was off-target with a penalty before Hola kicked one of his own to put Tonga within striking distance.However England, in an open match, soon found themselves in Tonga's 22.Although it seemed Cueto had botched a try-scoring chance by not passing, England did see Tait exploit an overlap out on the left in the 57th minute to score their third try.This time Wilkinson added the extras and England had a comforting 26-13 lead heading into the final quarter.Then former Great Britain rugby league captain Farrell went in under the posts against a tiring defence before Wilkinson's second drop-goal nudged England further in front.-AFP","England, France, Rugby Union, Rugby Union World Cup, Sport, Tonga, United Kingdom, ",2007-09-28 21:04:00+00:00

However, Tonga immediately hit back on both occasions to record their first win at the World Cup since 1999.Both sides were guilty of fundamental errors but what that game lacked in quality it made up for in entertainment as both teams frantically threw the ball around in the hope of picking up a consolation win a tough group that also includes South Africa and Samoa.Tonga made a flying start, catching the Americans napping with their giant pack of forwards, but the Americans refused to give in, twice threatening to steal the win.Maka, whose older brother Isitolo represented New Zealand in four Tests in 1998, capped his international debut with a try in the second minute off the back of a rolling maul.Tonga won a line-out inside the American quarter when US winger Salesi Sika was bundled into touch from the opening kick-off and immediately made their opponents pay when they expertly wheeled the ball across the line for the first try.Pierre Hola, Tonga's all-time leading point scorer, added the conversion then two penalties to give his side a handy lead before the Americans finally started to find their rhythm.Captain Mike Hercus opened the Eagles account with a penalty in the 32nd minute after missing an earlier attempt to cut the margin to 10 points at the break before MacDonald squeezed over in the corner shortly after the re-start as Tonga started to show signs of fatigue.Tonga regained control of the game and extended their lead to 10 points when left winger Vaka finished off a 60-metre counterattack involving skipper Nili Latu and full-back Vungakoto Lilo but the Americans again hit back.They got within three points when Stanfill was awarded a try that was referred to the South African video referee Mark Lawrence before Tonga called for fresh legs and Vaka responded by by beating five defenders to score under the posts and decide the match.-Reuters","France, Rugby Union, Rugby Union World Cup, Sport, Tonga, United States, ",2007-09-12 21:19:00+00:00

Loki Crichton kicked four conversions and a penalty, and replacement Lolo Lui kicked two conversions.For Tonga, Pierre Hola landed a sole penalty.But for the huge crowd the result was of secondary significance to the festival atmosphere in which they saw one of their great modern-day warriors do battle for the last time.Known as ""the chiropractor"" for his bone-crunching tackles which often left him as damaged and senseless as his target, Lima has been a feature of the Samoan side for 17 years and 63 Tests playing at either wing or centre.Throughout his career he has also been variously based in New Zealand, Japan, France, England and Ireland but never turned his back on his home island in the South Pacific.Lima, who is the only player to have scored tries in four World Cups, is set to make history later this year when he is expected to become the first player to appear in five World Cups.-AFP","Rugby Union, Samoa, Tonga, ",2007-06-24 07:00:00+00:00

The moral of the story is you have to save lives before you can save souls,"" he said.Those infected with HIV/AIDS are often ostracised by their families and by society at large due to the socially conservative attitudes in the islands, which discourage people from being tested and getting early treatment.Governments are increasingly aware of the HIV/AIDS problem but in Fiji, where the number of known infections is over 190 among a population of about 900,000, more needs to be done to stop the spread of the disease, he said.Transmission of HIV/AIDS in the Pacific region is primarily through sexual intercourse and from mother to unborn child, but drug use is also a factor, Mr Nailatikau said.""Tonga, Samoa and Fiji have a significant number of people living in developed countries where needle use is something to contend with. That is something we will have to look at in the future,"" he said.Antiviral drugs taken to delay the onset of full-blown AIDS is still not widely available in the Pacific. In Fiji, only around 20 HIV-infected people living in and around the capital Suva are receiving such treatment.""In rural areas, they don't get treatment so that is something they have to work on.
