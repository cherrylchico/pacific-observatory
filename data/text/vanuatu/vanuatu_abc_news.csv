But Pacific watchers say Mr Macron is keen to see the territory in French hands to counter China's lingering threat in the region.   In the speech in Port Vila on Thursday, Mr Macron again referred to China's aggressive push in the Pacific — although he did not mention the nation by name. ""First of all, there is the predation of the major powers: foreign ships fish illegally in the exclusive economic zone, numerous loans [that] are literally strangling development in the region,"" Mr Macron said.""Commercial practices are being increasingly distorted, interference is multiplying, and new imperialisms are emerging in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in Oceania, and a logic of power is threatening the sovereignty of many states, the smallest and often the most fragile.""Mr Macron, the first French president to tour a non-French Pacific island, is set to leave Vanuatu for Papua New Guinea on Thursday night.United States Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin arrived in Papua New Guinea on Wednesday, amid US attempts to cement its relations in the region's most populous nation.Mr Austin held a bilateral meeting PNG's Prime Minister James Marape on Thursday morning, as PNG itself looks to leverage the US's renewed interest in the region and ratify a defence agreement between the two nations.  The Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) was signed between PNG and the United States when Mr Blinken visited Port Moresby earlier this year. Mr Marape has faced domestic pushback over the agreement, with protests at the time of its signing and a possible legal challenge flagged by PNG's opposition leader over certain provisions of the document. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Austin revealed a US Coast Guard ship would arrive in Papua New Guinea next month, and that the US was not seeking ""permanent basing"" in the country.Yet, the agreement would give the United States access to key PNG bases for the next 15 years.It still has not been ratified by the country's parliament, with debate over the document adjourned until next month. On Thursday, Mr Lloyd said the United States' goal was to strengthen PNG's defence forces. He said the agreement would ""expand PNG capacity"" to modernise its forces and increase interoperability. ""We're not seeking permanent basing — this is a foundational framework to deepen that defence relationship,"" he said.Mr Marape told reporters that US defence personnel would visit the country from September, looking firstly at infrastructure development in PNG's second-largest city, Lae. ""[The DCA] means infrastructure is developed, not just our defence infrastructure and utilities, but more importantly the supporting infrastructures in and around the footprint of where the defence presence will be,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to the full rollout of the 15-year program we have with US defence force.""In New Zealand, Mr Blinken met with the New Zealand prime minister and foreign minister as he continued his lightning tour of the region.  They met at New Zealand's parliament buildings, known as the Beehive, where they held a joint press conference, but not before the US delegation was welcomed to Aotearoa with a powhiri — a Māori ceremony Mr Blinken said was something he would not forget. ""As we further develop AUKUS, the door is open to engagement,"" Mr Blinken said. ""As we continue to work on the second pillar, the door is very much open for NZ and other partners to engage as they see appropriate going forward.""NZ is a deeply trusted partner, a Five Eyes member, we've long worked together on the most important national security issues."" Mr Blinken also said New Zealand and the US stood ready to support ""a just and lasting peace"" in Ukraine ""based on the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence"".""These are the same principles that underlie the rules-based international order that we have been working to uphold in this region, and indeed, against those who seek to undermine them or advance an alternative version anywhere in the world,"" he said. ""We'll support all nations freely determining their relationships and their partnerships.""We also believe together that we should use those relationships both with allies and partners, and other nations, to defend and advance our affirmative vision for the Indo-Pacific, in which nations make their own sovereign decisions free from coercion."" Mr Blinken said New Zealand had been a leader ""on every issue of consequence"" in the Pacific, especially as the US was seeking to revitalise its presence in the region.Ms Mahuta said New Zealand viewed the US among its ""closest friends"" and valued their ""security relationship and strong defence connections"".""We discussed the rules-based international system, which has been fundamental to our prosperity, and the challenges it faces in a more contested global environment and our Pacific region,"" she said.Ms Mahuta was asked about New Zealand's position on Solomon Islands' security agreement with China.""We'll continue to push on the Solomon Islands PM [Manasseh] Sogavare to make clear what the full extent of those arrangements are so we can assess what it means for our region,"" she said.Ms Mahuta said New Zealand welcomed the increased US presence in the region, referencing Mr Blinken's visit to Tonga on Wednesday where he opened a new embassy.Mr Blinken is due to attend the United States versus Norway World Cup game in Wellington on Thursday. ","Foreign Affairs, New Zealand, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Politics and Government, Treaties and Alliances, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2023-07-27T04:47:47+00:00

You think about your family everyday, you miss them.""    The song is one of Fiji's biggest hits this year.""It was hard to write, I had my own experience working there.""It's slang, Ilavo ni Aussie Ilavo Mosimosi, it's what Fijians say when they're out there working on the farms.  ""It's big money, out there, but it's tough work."" The PALM scheme concept itself dates back to 2007, then known as the Seasonal Worker Program. When COVID hit, Australia's once-reliable source of seasonal labour, backpackers, evaporated and the agricultural sector turned to the Pacific.Thousands of Pacific Islanders streamed into the country, and the program has been expanding rapidly, with workers now able to work in Australia for nine months to four years.  ""I think it's the ultimate win-win,"" Minister for the Pacific Pat Conroy told the ABC.   ""Australia benefits by having our labour shortages filled by some of our closest neighbours, the workers win by picking up much needed skills and [on average] send home $15,000 per year."" Whilst the vast majority of employers and workers say the scheme is mutually beneficial, it has been dogged with persistent stories of exploitation around the accommodation provided, the work itself and services provided by employees.Pacific Islanders themselves have often struggled with the adaption required to work in Australia, while absconding has long been an issue.  And with its rapid expansion, it is causing major social issues in Pacific countries, with the ABC hearing dozens of stories of broken marriages and strained relationships because of the scheme.  In Fiji, there's even slang associated with extramarital affairs, with the word ""lasa tuba"" abbreviated to ""Aussie LT"" meaning the ""other partner"" in Australia.  In the Pacific the exodus to Australia is causing major headaches.  Pacific leaders raise it regularly, with Samoa's prime minister recently stating it was rivalling climate change as the ""number one"" issue the country faced. She said countries like hers should not been seen merely as ""outposts"" which ""grow"" labourers for developed nations. As of July 31, 38,259 Pacific Islanders were working in Australia through the scheme, down from a record of almost 40,000 in June. At the start of the year the figure was around 20,000.The Australian government wants the scheme to grow and has pushed back on criticisms that it is causing brain drain, saying Pacific leaders had the power to control or cap how many workers they allowed overseas. In a country like Tonga, the workers make up a staggering 6 per cent of the total population of the country.According to business owners in Tonga it is creating gaping holes in the workforce.""My turnover is too numerous to count,"" Tanoa Hotel Tonga manager Jason Strickland told the ABC. ""It's not equated to poor management, it's equated to people leaving overseas in big groups and I'm sure other businesses are experiencing this.""Essentially I feel like I'm running a hotel school.""     Mr Strickland said he had ""no issue"" with people moving to chase better opportunities.     He said the problem was highly-qualified staff moving overseas because the money was better, meaning, ironically, he's had to turn to other countries to fill the void.  ""I don't think the answer is for businesses to stamp their feet and ask these schemes to stop, I think they're here to stay,"" he said. ""But If you are going to take my chefs or my receptionists or my front office staff overseas and give them opportunities, I think they would be better suited in hotels and restaurants, rather than meat packing and agriculture.""The issue has extended to Tonga's major hospital. Nurse manager Meleinu Felise said as well as moving overseas to work in the aged-care sector, some nurses were opting to work in Australia picking fruit.   ""As we all know, nurses are moving around because of better pay 'on the other side',"" she said. ""They're looking for a better life.""But they say they want to come back, and they will come back, because their families are here. As we all know, in Tonga, we have obligations.  ""I hate to say it [but] if worse comes to worse, we'll get overseas workers, Pacific Islanders, to come and do a month here.""Back in Fiji, Nai Misipeka and her five children have learnt to adapt without their husband and father. The children do more in the garden and Nai brings in help from the community where she can.    The money John has made through the scheme has enabled them to lay-buy a new washing machine — the rest has gone on food. But, with another three years of work ahead, they have plans to build an extension on their home.""The money is good, but the important thing to us is our children,"" she said.""I want us, my family, to go to Australia [for the duration of his work] and support my husband. As soon as he's finished, we come back."" The Australian government has recognised this, introducing a ""trial"" of 200 long-term PALM scheme workers being able to bring their families to Australia.  Mr Conroy said he recognised for some families the separation was ""tough"".""[The trial] is aimed at dealing with that dislocation impact being reported to us,"" Mr Conroy said. ""And we have to work with communities to make sure it's in their interests to participate.   ""But overwhelmingly [this] has been positive for the Pacific, this is helping people out of poverty, and that's why it's so important.""With her husband still months away from a short trip home for Christmas, Nai has a message for him.  ""John, we will always love you.

If we find your ill-gotten gains, we will seize them. We will deal with you to the fullest extent of our laws,"" he said.Transparency International Australia chief executive Clancy Moore told the ABC that despite Singapore's reputation for strict enforcement of the law, it was actually an attractive place to set up shop for money launderers.""Singapore offers criminals, crooks and kleptocrats one of the world's top secrecy jurisdictions to stash their illicit finances and proceeds from crime,"" Mr Moore said.""It's home to many regional banking institutions, has a very low corporate tax and people can create company structures with a click of a mouse.""For example, we know that many organised crime gangs and authoritarian regimes like the Myanmar junta use Singapore as their financial hub to clean their dirty money.""Among the nine men and one woman arrested were three citizens of China, three of Cambodia, one of Vanuatu, one of Türkiye and two of Cyprus.  However, in the days following the raids it emerged that all were originally from China's Fujian province.Among the items seized were extra passports for the suspects — in addition to their nominal citizenship — that police believed were issued by countries including Vanuatu, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Cambodia and Dominica.Many countries have pathways to citizenship through investment, though some pathways are much shorter than others. Countries that still have fast-track schemes taking just months include Türkiye, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Dominica.The EU last year suspended Vanuatu's visa waiver agreement over its lucrative ""golden passport"" scheme amid concerns it lacked due diligence and could pose security and money-laundering risks. The scheme, which accounted for about a third of Vanuatu's government revenue in 2020, allowed people to buy citizenship for $US130,000.Cyprus cancelled its Citizenship by Investment Program in 2020 following an Al Jazeera investigation into its use by criminals. In the wake of the Singapore police operation, Cypriot MP Irene Charalambidou asked for a full briefing from the interior ministry, the Cyprus Mail reported.""The international stigmatisation of our country as a result of the abuse behind the golden passports should be immediately managed by the competent minister, so their passports are revoked,"" she said.The Phnom Penh Post reported that three of the suspects had received Cambodian citizenship through naturalisation in 2018 and 2019. Mr Moore said obtaining additional citizenships was useful for money launderers.""Citizenship makes it easier for money launderers to set-up company structures and buy property and invest in a new country so as to avoid detection and regulation,"" he said.""Many countries set up golden visa and passport schemes to attract investment and business.""Over the last decade, corrupt public officials and business people have bought up golden passports and visas, helping to conceal their assets and identities.""Mr Moore said scandals had demonstrated that these opaque schemes were not about genuine investment or migration.""Since the invasion in Ukraine, Russians are making up a majority of people who have acquired citizenship using this route,"" he said.""Transparency International Australia has argued for years that fast-track investment migration schemes are riddled with corruption risks and enable money laundering.""In Australia and parts of Europe, controversial golden visa programs have been scrapped in recent years due to concerns with rorting, risks of money laundering and general integrity of the schemes.""ABC/Reuters","Asia, Cambodia, China, Corporate Crimes, Corruption, Cyprus, Police, Singapore, Turkiye, Vanuatu, ",2023-08-24T20:24:56+00:00

We adopt a non-aligned policy,"" he said.""We now live in a very dynamic, geopolitical landscape … where each country must be able to decide how they deal with that for the best interest of their countries.""The new prime minister's majority remains narrow, and some MPs in Vanuatu are predicting that the new government could well face its own no-confidence motion before too long.Mr Kilman's last term in office was also plagued by corruption, with 14 sitting members of parliament — including the deputy prime minister and speaker — sentenced to prison on corruption and bribery charges.But the new prime minister told the ABC he wanted to push ahead with his proposal for a new integrity bill which he said would reduce corruption and help stabilise politics in Vanuatu, in part by subsidising political parties in the country.""One of the priorities for me … would be to try and speak to all political leaders [on the bill],"" he said.""If I can do that, and we can come to some agreements on issues in that bill, and if we can get it passed in parliament, that would be a big step forward to maintaining and having a stable government in Vanuatu.""Dr Newton Cain said that similar reforms had been discussed for a long time in Vanuatu, but ""so far there has yet to be sufficient consensus to get measures such as these across the line"". ""Passing a law is one thing — without appropriate architecture, resources and commitment to apply and prosecute the law it is likely to be meaningless,"" she said.""Also if the various checks and balances are applied to political parties then what we will likely see (as we did in Solomon Islands) is an increase in people standing as independents to avoid the scrutiny — of course this would also mean they would miss out on the benefit of receiving funding.""During a previous tenure as prime minister in 2012, Mr Kilman expelled 12 Australian Federal Police officers from Vanuatu after he was stopped while transiting through an Australian airport and his adviser was arrested by Australian police on tax fraud charges. ","Australia, China, Defence and National Security, Federal Government, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2023-09-05T02:58:14+00:00

All my friends were dark-skinned, with brown eyes and curly dark hair,"" she said. ""We didn't wear a lot of clothing, although my parents did insist that I wear sandals because of hook worm and other sorts of problems that could gain entry through the cuts in the feet.""Trading ships that would come to the islands in search of sandalwood and copra delivered mail every three to six months along with supplies of flour, sugar and salt.A house cow provided milk which Ms MacRaild's mother would make into butter.But with no telephone or radio, she recalls her mother feeling particularly isolated raising young children on her own.With no refrigeration, the family ate fresh fish and seafood and kept a few valuable cattle that would be slaughtered for special occasions and shared with the villagers.""When I was given a naming ceremony, my parents gave the villagers a bullock and 60 kilograms of rice, because they knew that when the ceremony was over there would be a feast,"" Ms MacRaild said.""Everybody else brought taro, yam, lap-lap, which is grated root vegetable, even green bananas mixed with coconut milk, wrapped in banana leaves and cooked in an earth oven.""When the family returned to Australia in 1953, Ms MacRaild was seven years old.She recalls the massive culture shock of Australian life, and the primary school students who couldn't comprehend how she could have been born in Vanuatu with white skin.""I'd been used to wearing sandals, came to Australia going to school I had to wear shoes and socks,"" she said of the burning pain of having to wear black leather school shoes, preferring to run around barefoot after school.She eventually studied nursing, settling in Valencia Creek with her history teacher husband, Don.After her mother died in 1966, her father remarried and frequently returned to Vanuatu with his new wife and played a key role in Vanuatu's transition to independence. Ms MacRaild said he was still able to converse with Tanna locals in their native tongue up until he died aged 98.Don and Meg MacRaild have carried on the family connection to Vanuatu via their outreach projects and helping seasonal workers who come to Australia.With around 105 language dialects under the common pidgin English language of Bislama, tribal communities still operate in remote areas such as Tanna.Mr MacRaild describes Vanuatu as having a share culture, where survival comes down to fending for the group, as opposed to the Anglo-European mentality of fending for oneself.""It's all about sharing, and a family member cannot deny a request from another family member,"" he said.Consequently there are taboos around direct communication, such as asserting one's self from the group or speaking one's own name.""Their real name is something that they couldn't tell you themselves without giving you power over them,"" he said, explaining that you have to ask someone else a person's real name.Similarly, if a white person wants to ask a direct question to a specific person, the protocol is to ask the group and let a discussion flow around the circle before that person can respond.Having found themselves in hot water with this over the years, Mr MacRaild said the indirect communication style often amounted to misunderstandings and disputes between villagers.He said ""jumping to conclusions"" made villagers vulnerable to scams and fanatical belief systems, citing the cargo cult known as the John Frum society as an example.He said that during the 1930s, when the first affluent Americans would sail to the Pacific Islands by yacht, a visitor came ashore introducing himself as ""John from America"".In trying to describe the ways of the outside world, he explained that planes would one day come to the islands, bringing technologies from the modern world.During World War II, the description became prophecy as cargo planes dropped supplies to the islands, leading the natives to believe that John Frum America was a messenger of the gods.""There is still a cargo cult in Tanna,"" Mr MacRaild said.""We have attended some of their ceremonies and they worship a WWII radio, and they have all sorts of military uniforms that they wear. I've seen them do a 21-gun salute with sticks.""Mr MacRaild said the intergenerational trauma caused by blackbirding, and a deep belief and fear in black magic and cursing, was also problematic for his team working in Vanuatu.However the family's 80-year goodwill legacy in helping the sick, injured and transforming the lives of many disabled children had protected their team from prejudice and animosity.What began as the Vanuatu Prevention of Blindness Project in 2000 with funds from the Rotary Club of Sale, the MacRailds' outreach has largely survived on bequests, government grants and donations from churches and op shops.""We never have enough, we're always struggling for finances,"" Mr MacRaild said of their registered charity.Despite fewer volunteers participating in community outreach project groups like Rotary, he said country people had a longstanding affinity with helping their Pacific Island neighbours.He notes the 145-year history of fundraising for the islands at the St Andrews Uniting Church in Stratford, which began collecting money for the New Hebrides in 1877 in protest of blackbirding practices.In recent times, Gippsland's farming communities have assisted Ni-Vanuatu seasonal workers with clothing, food, counselling and ""life admin"" support.But in all the financial and logistical struggles they have endured over the years, the MacRailds laugh that ""the Lord has had a habit of providing"" at critical times. ""In all these situations, you build friendships, really strong friendships that run across boundaries,"" Mr MacRaild said. ""Beyond that there is a sense that you're a vehicle of change.""","Charities, Community Organisations, Foreign Aid, People, Valencia Creek, Vanuatu, Volunteers, ",2023-09-23T01:40:16+00:00

An additional wastewater release pump was activated 20 minutes after the first, and plant officials said everything was moving smoothly so far. There are some 1.4 million tonnes of wastewater stored in large containers, which had been used to cool three melted nuclear reactors destroyed when a powerful tsunami struck the region in 2011.The plant's operators, TEPCO, have stated it was running out of room, and needed to discharge the water to allow the clean-up to continue.TEPCO will start discharging relatively small amounts, releasing 30 storage tanks worth by April. There are 1,020 tanks holding the treated water on site to be released over 30 years.Some 500,000 litres-a-day of treated wastewater will eventually be discharged into the Pacific Ocean, through an underwater pipe that extends a kilometre from the Japanese mainland.Japanese authorities have vowed the water will not harm the health of local people, marine life, or the environment, which will be released only after passing through an intense filtration system and verified as safe.It secured the backing of the United Nation's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which stated the plan met international norms and environmental damage would be ""negligible"", after a two-year investigation.But the Japanese government has been unable to convince local fishermen, who hold grave fears about reputational damage.The Japanese public remained mixed about the discharge, with a recent poll showing just over half of Japan's residents, 53 per cent, support the move, while 41 per cent said no.Seventy-five per cent of respondents said the government had not done enough to prevent reputational damage.Fishers have accused TEPCO of breaking a promise in 2015 that it would not ""will not dispose of [treated water] without gaining the understanding of those concerned"".""Even though it is scientifically safe, the reputation damage [to local business] remains,"" the head of the Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations, Masanobu Sakamoto, said this week.Environmental activists have also launched a last-ditch complaint to the UN's Human Rights commission.An intense filtration system, known as ALPS, removes harmful radioactive materials, except a form of radioactive form of hydrogen called tritium, which cannot be removed.The water is then heavily diluted, so the amount of tritium falls well within ""safe"" drinking standards determined by the World Health Organisation.Specifically, authorities state the water will contain about 190 becquerels of tritium per litre, far below the drinking water limit of 10,000. A becquerel is a measurement of radioactive activity.Tritiated water, as it's known, is commonly released from nuclear power plants across the world.""This is safe,"" said Tony Hooker, director of the Centre for Radiation Research at the University of Adelaide.""We have not seen any environmental or human health effects from these previous tritium releases and the tritium releases from other nuclear facilities around the world are much, much higher than what the Japanese will release.""There will be trace elements of other radionuclides but they're well below any regulatory limit.""Australian scientist Nigel Marks from Curtin University agreed the plan was safe, saying the large volume of water — enough to fill 500 Olympic swimming pools — had ""extremely low levels of radioactivity"" and wasn't much greater than what was already found in the environment. ""There is about three grams of pure tritium in that very large volume of water, so most of the water is just plain regular water that we would normally drink or swim in,"" he told the ABC.""It is radioactive — there's no denying that — but it's at such low levels that it won't hurt the fish that swim near that outlet point, it will be perfectly safe to eat the fish. It'll have no discernible effect whatsoever anywhere in the world.""It's the kind of thing that sounds wrong, but it's actually very safe.""TEPCO has vowed to provide real time data on their website, and a safety shut-off valve will kick in if any abnormalities are detected.The IAEA vowed to continue monitoring the release, which is expected to take 30 to 40 years.China has led a campaign against the release, calling it ""extremely selfish and irresponsible"", and imposing some food import bans.China has banned all imports of all aquatic products originating from Japan, customs authorities said in a statement.""We will continue to pay attention to the situation of the discharge of nuclear contaminated water into the sea in Japan, and adjust relevant regulatory measures,"" they added.But associate professor Marks pointed out China has its own nuclear industry and has also released tritium into the water for similar reasons to Japan. ""I would see the interactions between China and Japan through a political lens rather than a scientific one,"" he said. But there are mixed views across the Indo-Pacific.South Korea, which is trying to mend thorny historical differences with Japan, has said it neither opposes nor endorses the discharge, but accepted it was within ""international standards"" and it held no scientific concerns.Some Pacific Island nations have opposed the water release, citing concerns about the threat to the marine environment and public health.Pacific Islands Forum secretary-general Henry Puna acknowledged the ""divergent views"" on the issue among the Pacific leaders, but said he had been given assurances by Japan's prime minister that the release would not take place until the water was safe.""That's a commitment that our leaders I'm sure we will be holding Japan to, should anything go wrong,"" he said.""We've done our best to get Japan not to commence a discharge until there is full agreement that it's verifiably safe to do so. But Japan has taken a sovereign position. And that point is now past.""In a statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Australia ""has confidence in the process that has led to the decision by Japan to release the treated water"". Meanwhile, civil society groups have made a last-minute attempt to halt the plan, calling on the United Nations Human Rights Committee to urgently intervene.The Pacific Network on Globalisation (PANG) wrote to the UNHRC, saying the water release risks violating Pacific people's human rights.PANG coordinator Maureen Penjueli said she was particularly concerned about the right to a healthy environment and the rights of future generations in the Pacific.""It will affect the livelihoods of our people, our cultural practices,"" she said.""We would like the [UN] special rapporteurs to put out a call to effectively put a halt to Japan's decision until all of the matters raised in the complaint, as well as the viable alternatives have been fully exhausted.""A spokesperson for the special rapporteur on toxics and human rights told the ABC they would carefully consider requests for new communications.""Several special rapporteurs have written to Japan repeatedly raising concerns about the discharge of Fukushima waters to the Pacific Ocean,"" they said.Vanuatu's Foreign Minister Matai Seremaiah has also urged members of the Melanesian Spearhead Group, who are meeting in Vanuatu's capital Port Vila, to denounce Japan's plan.Fiji's Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka has previously backed the release, as has Palau's Prime Minister Surangel Whipps Jr.""They're not releasing the treated water in Palau, they're not releasing it in Fiji, they're releasing it right off their shores — one mile off their shores,"" Mr Whipps Jr told ABC's The Pacific program.The Pacific region has suffered ongoing consequences of nuclear testing by the United States, France and the United Kingdom in the mid-to-late 1900s.However, Prime Minister Brown has previously stated that the Fukushima discharge would not violate regional anti-nuclear treaties, because it will be a controlled release.There have also been calls to store the water underground, something Japan said would be far too expensive.Dame Meg Taylor, the former secretary general to the Pacific Islands Forum and member of Pacific Elders Voice, has questioned why the water can't be released into Japan's lakes rather than the Pacific Ocean, if it's safe.She said assurances from the IAEA did not change her mind.""And I don't think it changes the minds of many, many Pacific Islanders, particularly young people, because it's about their future,"" she said.Additional reporting by Mackenzie Smith","Asia, Australia, China, Cook Islands, Disasters and Accidents, Environment, Fiji, Government and Politics, Japan, Korea, Republic Of, Nuclear Accidents and Incidents, Nuclear Energy, Nuclear Issues, Oceans and Reefs, Pacific, Vanuatu, Water Pollution, World Politics, ",2023-08-24T04:08:40+00:00

They've made a lot of commitment in the past, but it's about time they put resources into it,"" he said.Mr Moli, whose village was relocated due to rising sea levels, said Australia would have the Pacific's support in hosting COP but it needs to ""step up your work in the Pacific"".""You need to come down and listen.

It is not clear whether they have been invited to address the summit.Senator Wong, questioned by a reporter outside the summit, said Australia was trying to undertake ""a big transition in a short space of time"". ""We will be, by 2030, in excess of 80 per cent renewable energy – when we came to government, we were just over 30 per cent,"" Senator Wong said.  ""We recognise our history and the nature of our economy ... we are genuinely motivated to change that."" In a statement, Ms McAllister said Australia was part of the international fight against climate change.""I look forward to promoting Australia's constructive role on climate change at home, in the Pacific and beyond as we build momentum towards this year's Conference of the Parties [COP] in Dubai,"" she said.Dr Wesley Morgan, senior researcher at the Climate Council, is an expert in multilateral cooperation on climate change and said although Australia likes to think of itself as a leader on climate change, Pacific nations have been the real leaders for decades.""Australia likes to claim it is a leader, but in contrast to the Pacific global climate leadership, Australia is a global climate laggard and unfortunately, is still behind the eight ball,"" he said.""The Pacific Island countries are the reason why we have the Paris Agreement and [it] is the only means we have to cooperate globally to cut emissions.""Dr Morgan said that although the New York climate summit is a long way from the lived realities of Pacific communities, ""the link is direct and it is crucial"".""It is global summits like these that are crucially important for setting an agenda for moving away from coal, oil and gas and shifting to a global clean energy economy and that will mean survival for Pacific Island communities,"" he said.Dr Denniss said that Australia had the resources to be a Pacific leader on climate change, but it was yet to prove itself.""Australia still spends around $11 billion a year on fossil fuel subsidies, yet when it comes to supporting Pacific nations with climate finance, and indeed disaster recovery, we spend a tiny percentage of that on our Pacific neighbours,"" he said. ""I don't blame them for wishing Australia would show leadership on this front, but to be clear, after decades, there's no sign that that's what Australia wants to become.""Dr Denniss said the United Nations climate summits could achieve better outcomes if grassroots organisations were better platformed. ""I think that they do a better job these days of including diverse opinions, particularly from grassroots organisations in smaller countries. But I don't think for a minute that those groups have anything like the access that the fossil fuel industry has, that big business has,"" he said.""If leaders spent more time talking to community organisations that represent people that really are on the frontline of the climate catastrophe … and less time listening to fossil fuel executives explaining the role that gas has to play in tackling climate change … I think we'd get much better outcomes if we had much broader consultations.""","Australia, Climate Change, Community and Society, Environmental Impact, Fiji, Pacific, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2023-09-19T23:44:02+00:00

It spells doom, and the end of their existence,"" Ms Fifita said.It has been estimated that oceans absorb around a quarter of the world's carbon emissions and capture 90 per cent of the heat from those emissions.In a forum where legalese and climate statistics could have dominated, Ms Fifita's focus on the personal brought a global existential crisis to an individual level.She said she was speaking before the court as an Indigenous Tuvaluan, as a youth, and ""as a mother to a daughter of the Pacific who opened her eyes to the world just one year ago"".""My fears are for the kind of world she will inherit, when then lands of her ancestors are taken by the rising sea,"" she said.She said in some parts of the Pacific, the word for placenta, island and soil are the same.""All of these terms represent home and connection – the island and the islander are one,"" she said.""The relationship between the two is a deeply spiritual and reciprocal bond, reliant on the other's existence.""In this context, the failure to comply with obligations to protect and preserve the marine environment is quite simply a death sentence for entire peoples and their way of life.""It was, she said, ""essentially a form of extinction"".Her sentiments were echoed by Tuvalu's prime minister, Kausea Natano, who told the court the nation, made up of nine low-lying coral atolls, was on average just 1.9 metres above sea level.""Tuvalu is expected to be one of the first countries in the world to be completely lost to sea level-induced climate change,"" he said.However, research from the University of Auckland suggests Tuvalu's land mass increased by almost 3 per cent over four decades to 2014. Some smaller, uninhabited islands in Tuvalu have shrunk, but others had grown due to sediment, corals and other debris being washed ashore.The same study reported that the seas around Tuvalu rose by just under 4 millimetres each year between 1971 and 2014 — about twice the global average over that period. Mr Natano said he saw international law as an essential mechanism for spelling out, in detail, the obligations of states to respond to the climate crisis and urged the tribunal to issue a ""strong opinion"".""The science is clear and undisputed. These impacts are the result of climate change brought on by greenhouse gas emissions – some of them are irreversible,"" he said. ""Just a few years. That's all we have.""My people will rightfully ask, if international law has nothing to say about an entire country going under water as a result of harmful conduct, then what purpose does it serve?""The request for the court's advisory opinion is ""unprecedented"", according to Donald Rothwell, a professor of international law at the Australian National University College of Law.""There's been no other case before any international court or tribunal in which this particular issue has been raised,"" he said.""This tribunal's ruling could be very powerful in terms of making very clear what exactly are the extent of countries' international obligations under the Law of the Sea, with respect to the protection and preservation of the marine environment from the effects of climate change.""Most countries have ratified the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea, which includes an obligation to protect the marine environment, but it makes no mention of greenhouse gases, emissions or climate change.The landmark case is being seen as a test case, with small island leaders calling on the court to clarify existing laws. This was the first time they had been asked to weigh in on the ""trans-boundary pollution"" of the marine environment, Professor Rothwell added.""It's really a case of where the pollution is moving from one country to another, and another country is impacted and harmed and impaired as a result of the polluting activities of another country,"" he said.""It's raising some very distinctive questions which international law scholars and commentators have considered and debated for many decades. But they've never been able to come to a real resolution to that question.""A decision is expected in early 2024.""This decision, when it eventually is handed down, will be a real game changer for a crystallisation and a clear understanding of what the legal obligations are, with respect to the Law of the Sea and climate change,"" Professor Rothwell said.Hearings will continue into next week, with a representative from Australia due to give a submission before the court later on Wednesday.Earlier this year, Vanuatu brought a case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) – sometimes called the World Court – to rule on obligations of states in relation to global heating.That case is co-sponsored by Australia among more than 100 other countries.While the Oceans Court is not as high profile as the ICJ and this case is separate, Vanuatu's attorney-general, Arnold Kiel Loughman, described them as complementary.Because of its specific focus on the marine environment, and because the Oceans Court decision is expected sooner than the ICJ's, it ""will establish the precedent that will shape what will follow,"" Mr Loughman said.But he said to be meaningful, it must go beyond ""abstract principles"".""For us, time is running out,"" he said before the court.Rather than a ""dystopian world ravaged by unimaginable disasters and widespread suffering"", the tribunal could provide a road map forward, he said.""Climate change not only threatens to destroy my country – it is coming for us all. But we will not go down without a fight.""Ms Fifita, who opened her address with a reference to her daughter, closed by recalling a conversation she had with her grandfather when she was 12 years old.She asked him how he felt about the idea that Tuvalu would soon disappear, and after a moment's reflection, he responded: ""It will never be gone"".She called on the court to issue a ""robust"" and historic decision.""To ensure my grandfather's declaration comes true, to ensure Tuvalu never disappears, I endeavour to do my part,"" she said.""In 10 years from now I hope to still be able to take my daughter to the island in Tuvalu after which he named me.""","Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Climate Change, Community and Society, Courts and Trials, Environmental Impact, Fiji, Pacific, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2023-09-12T18:30:38+00:00

Maybe we'll work for three days or four days,"" he said.""Once the payment comes in, then the boss gets all the money from the deductions."" He said when that happened his take-home pay was significantly less, which affected both him and his family at home.Uniting Church senior social justice advocate Mark Zirnsak said the PALM workers, who often came from low socio-economic backgrounds, were very reliant on their job and bonded to their Australian employers.   The workers are not eligible for Australian welfare support or payments, and can't find other work under their visa conditions.Dr Zirnsak said he knew of a group of PALM workers who had to rely on food charity after going seven weeks without paid work. ""Those situations leave workers in really desperate situations and their families back in the Pacific who were depending on them to send money home,"" he said.Dr Zirnsak said the reforms would also bring Australia into line with farm worker schemes in New Zealand and the United Kingdom.Other changes he supports include giving workers seven days' notice of termination. Currently, workers can find themselves out of work with no notice, which means they may lose their accommodation, which is often provided by the employer.Dr Zirnsak said some changes would benefit employers, such as the possibility to claim a travel cost reimbursement from the government, as well as a more streamlined approval process for worker accommodation.New South Wales-based Pacific welfare worker Valencia Packete has seen many contracts stipulating a minimum of 30 hours of work averaged out over a nine-month period, but knows in reality that doesn't always happen.""I understand in the horticulture industry, sometimes, [that] seasons don't account for that 30 hours,"" she said.""I have spoken to many workers who are crying out for help.""Ms Packete said one way to ensure workers were getting enough money could be to allow more flexibility for PALM participants to work for different employers.Currently under their visa conditions Pacific workers are bonded to their employer and are unable to switch jobs if they don't get enough hours or the work is unsuitable.The workers can only change employers with the approval of their employer and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations.In the absence of this, there have been cases of workers absconding and breaching their visa conditions after alleged pay and condition problems.""There has to be a way where the contractors can shift the workers to another farm,"" Ms Packete said.Pacific Island Council of South Australia chair Tukini Tavui said Pacific workers on nine-month short-term visas were the most vulnerable to working hour variability.While he acknowledged that the minimum hours change would be ""difficult and almost impossible for some of those small farmers"" he hoped they would not abandon the program.He said key changes included better portability for workers to move from one employer to another, improved flexibility to move from the short-term to the long-term visas scheme, and clarity around deductions and pay.""That's been one of the big contributors to some of the concerns and challenges with the program,"" he said.Tania Chapman, who manages farming operations at Nutrano, said the obligation for businesses like hers to pay workers 30 hours a week, ""irrespective of whether they work or not"" will put massive pressure on her business.She said the citrus farm in north-west Victoria was often interrupted by the weather during the winter harvest season, which could see an ""average four rain days every week"".Ms Chapman said if growers leave the PALM scheme in large numbers because of cost pressure of minimum working hours it would be a ""double whammy"" for relations between Pacific Island workers and Australian farmers.""These communities, these islands, these countries, they rely so heavily on us,"" she said.Meanwhile in Western Australia, Fruitico Group chief executive Roger Fahl said while he understood the fairness of introducing minimum working hours, in practice the change was hard to swallow for his business.The table grape exporter, who is an approved employer under the scheme, employs about 250 workers on farms in the state's south west and far north.""We're out in mother nature, as most growers are, and she doesn't always play by the rules,"" he said. A Department of Employment and Workplace Relations spokesperson said there would be a ""staged implementation"" of the new PALM guidelines with ""planned and unscheduled visits"" to monitor changes.""The department consulted extensively over 18 months on potential changes to the PALM settings that include industry, approved employers, participating countries, unions, civil society groups and other stakeholders.""Dr Zirnsak said improving cultural understanding between employers and workers would also be addressed within the new guidelines.""[Employers] need to have some knowledge of Pacific Island cultures and treat workers in a respectful way, and that's going to increase worker productivity,"" he said.Picker Mr Yakapus said employers understanding more about Islander culture would improve the program.""One of the most important things about Islanders is they have more respect with each other,"" he said.""When we say something bad to someone, we have to apologise to him before we continue the day, or we continue to work.""Mr Yakapus while there were challenges within the worker program, he was happy working to support his family ""to buy food and to rebuild the house for them to sleep [in]"".","Agricultural Policy, Bendigo, Bundaberg, Farm Labour, Fruit, Immigration, Immigration Policy, Mildura, Pacific, Renmark, Rockhampton, Sale, Toowoomba, Vanuatu, Work, ",2023-06-18T19:46:28+00:00

Each day for the last many months, we've not seen one single truck.""Waterholes dried up, and some people were left without enough food.""We have people who are landless; they've been coming in and stealing because there's a drought, they're hungry, so they come in and steal at night,"" Ms Linibi said. ""So, we've lost most of our planting materials as well ... that's how bad it is.""Now scientists are predicting an El Niño system — a cyclical weather event that occurs over the Pacific and surrounding countries — is likely to develop later this year.This means less rain for Papua New Guinea and likely even more drought.""The droughts are coming, and what do we do?"" Ms Linibi asked.  The impacts of El Niño will be felt across the region in different ways.While drier weather can be expected for much of the Pacific, some areas like Kiribati and Tuvalu historically receive higher rainfall during El Niño.Robson Tigona, a lecturer in environmental science at the University of Vanuatu, said El Niño was a normal climate phenomenon in the Pacific.""If we have an El Niño event this year [in] Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Tonga, southern Cook Islands, there will be a drop in rainfall and then the opposite will happen in Tuvalu and Kiribati,"" he said.""So during El Niño, we're expecting below-normal rainfall in Vanuatu, for example, but in Tuvalu and Kiribati, we're expecting high rainfall.""If an El Niño were to occur this year, it would ""increase the activity of tropical cyclones in the Pacific region"", he added. In Vanuatu, cyclones, not drought, have left farmers and food supplies vulnerable.Two cyclones hit the country last month, causing widespread damage.""I planted some cassava, banana with sweet potato, small cucumbers … but the cyclone that came spoiled everything,"" said Ruth Yowko, a farmer from the Teouma Valley in Efate Island Vanuatu.Moses John Amos, director-general of Vanuatu's Ministry of Agriculture, said 80 per cent of the people who lived in local communities relied on root crop agriculture.If an El Niño does develop, drier weather could delay the country's recovery efforts and cause food shortages. ""If we have an El Niño, it will negatively impact cultivation of any replanting program that the ministry will be carrying out,"" Mr Amos said.Experts in Vanuatu said the government needed to invest in infrastructure and education to build resilience against a changing climate.""Global warming will increase the frequency and intensity of El Niño as well as La Nina,"" Mr Tigona said. ""We need proper water supply systems in place, good rainwater harvesting systems ... we need to promote drought resilient crops."" In the face of extreme weather, Hannington Tate Tamala from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization said ensuring resilient food production was important.  ""We should start looking at the crops which are resilient, and local varieties that are available,"" he said. ""Wild yam is a good example of a resilient crop because it will be under the ground.""I know when the cyclone comes, [it] removes all the vines, but it's still there.

Law and order issues could be better addressed by investment in youth, development and economic opportunity.""And, finally, the greatest security threat — climate change — requires strengthened disaster preparedness and response.""Tess Newton Cain from the Griffith Asia Institute's Pacific Hub said both governments could face deep opposition in Solomon Islands and the wider Pacific region if they pushed ahead with the plan.""The question is whether the people of Solomon Islands think this is a good idea,"" Dr Newton Cain said.""There are huge human security and development challenges in Solomon Islands. I do not see how a military addresses the issue of a lack of adequate health care or education.""Numerous political and civil society voices from the region have raised their concerns about militarisation and how it is not wanted. Perhaps these voices are the ones Mr Marles should be paying attention to.""","Australia, China, Defence Forces, Defence Industry, Defence and National Security, Federal Government, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Unrest, Conflict and War, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2023-07-19T09:27:16+00:00

Missionaries and traders were common on Ambrym Island, and they thought nothing of the ship coming towards the beach near the village at Dip Point.By the time they realised, it was too late. Lilon's great-grandfather was taken.From the 1860s until 1901, trading ships from Australia would visit South Pacific islands looking for people to work on plantations.Many were tricked aboard or even kidnapped, in a practice now known as Blackbirding.""They were taken against their will,"" Lilon told Sistas, Let's Talk.""They were treated very badly... they had malnutrition, they had, health problems because it was a long journey to Australia.""People like Lilon's great-grandfather were sent to sugar plantations to work in hostile conditions for almost no money. Some weren't paid at all.Fifteen per cent of those blackbirded to Australia died from exposure to illnesses, malnutrition, or mistreatment.Then in 1901, after Australia became a federation, it passed the White Australia Policy, aimed at banning people of non-European ethnicities from entering or working in the country.The thousands of Pacific Island workers who had been in Australia for decades were suddenly deported.About 1,500 people remained and became known as Australian South Sea Islanders.Displaced and having lost their connections to their island homelands, the South Sea Islanders were left to survive on the fringes of Australian society, and their descendants grew up not really knowing where they came from.For years, their main connection to their past was through oral storytelling.Their grandparents or great-grandparents may have been taken from Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Tuvalu, New Caledonia or Fiji, but they knew very little about the places and people they left behind.But as international travel became more affordable and with the rise of social media, more and more South Sea Islanders re-established connections to their culture and history.And as they find cousins in the Pacific, their Pacific relatives are finally learning what happened to the ancestors who were taken.While Lilon hasn't found her own relatives in Australia, she is working to help people from the Australian South Sea Islander community connect with their relatives in Vanuatu.""It started way, way back, but I only came in in 2014 when I organised the first family reunion for one of my relatives here,"" she said.""It was an emotional event because the blackbirding days were devastating for our families. It was passed on from generation to generation. And it was hard. ""Over the years, people tried to get over what happened.""I guess the reunification is building back that memory and reconnecting values that were taken away.""Sonia Minniecon is a descendant of the First Nations Kabi people and of Australian South Sea Islanders from Vanuatu.She runs an organisation called Blackbird International, which connects South Sea Islanders with their families in the Pacific and runs tours so they can visit their islands.Her journey began as her parents grew older and became unwell, and she wanted to reconnect for them.""For them, knowing that there were actually people, descendants of uncles or brothers that were taken, still living and alive in Australia... we thought that was such an important part of our family.""We know that our community ... is so large in Queensland and we wanted to help them on their journey to find family. So we established Blackbird International in 2003.""Sonia's work involves trying to comb through plantation owners' records and shipping records and matching them with oral stories from the islands and other communities. ""Once you know who you are and where you come from, it just makes you a whole person,"" she said.""There are still families over there that don't know what happened to their brother or uncle. And the fact that they could even have descendants, you know, cousins, family, just blows people away.""One story we had was a family here in Australia that had a story that'd been told to them. They weren't sure how true it was, [but] it was about the salt water, their island, and certain animals that connected them.""And we went back to Vanuatu and [there was] a family who had that same story. And that was a direct connection. An oral history from that island and that village, you know, that's how we connect to places through those stories.""Many times, the ship owners just wrote the island from which they were taken. So, in Australia, there were a lot of families with the surname of Ambrym or Obah or Tanna, the islands which they came from.""So that's another way in which we connect families.""Reconnecting families, and the moment they meet, is a time of happiness and joy.For Sonia herself, returning to her ancestral lands was a beautiful feeling.""I think that it takes a village to raise a child, but when you go back over there, you see that, and you feel it,"" she said.""We had a ceremony for my dad. That was the first time we went back, and they performed what they call a Rom. It's a men's ceremony, so the women shouldn't be a part of that, but because it was for my dad, they were allowed to be part of that ceremony.""Men are dressed ... in their traditional costumes ... and they've got big masks on which are vibrantly coloured, and they've got long cones on their arms with shells and shakers.""We're standing in this circle and there's no one around. You can feel the ground shake because they're coming down and you can hear whistling and noises as they come into the circle and they're dancing. It's like they're floating.""Being a part of that culture, knowing it's yours, was beautiful.""Since then, Sonia has helped reunite other families torn apart by blackbirding.When families reunite, she said, although there were sometimes language difficulties, there was joy, happiness, acknowledgement and welcome.""Everyone starts looking at each other's faces and they [see]... the resemblances of people and the names and the similarity.""And I know of others that have gone back and now carry traditional names, which is beautiful.""In the process of rediscovering her own family, Sonia too found her traditional name.""It's actually Lena.

[and] are not intended to be binding on states.""The resolution, drafted by 18 countries, has asked the ICJ to rule on:What obligations do states, under international law, have to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases for States and for present and future generationsWhat legal consequences there are under these obligations for states where they, by their acts and omissions, have caused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment, with respect to:(a) States, including, in particular, small island developing states, which due to their geographical circumstances and level of development, are injured or specially affected by or are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change(b) Peoples and individuals of the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate changeProfessor Young said despite being non-binding, ICJ opinions were effective and could influence laws overseas.This was highlighted in an advisory opinion on the sovereignty of Western Sahara in 1975.""Australia didn't participate in that opinion, but subsequently, that opinion was cited by our High Court in the landmark Mabo decision of 1992 that found terra nullius to be a legal fiction in Australia, leading to massive changes to the law,"" Professor Young said.Advisory opinions on climate change could strengthen legal cases and clarify where countries are responsible for the carbon they emit, she said.""There is still uncertainty about the content of state obligations, despite the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.""Vanuatu, home to about 300,000 people across roughly 80 islands, has been labelled the most at-risk country in the world for natural disasters. In late February, Vanuatu was hit by two cyclones just days apart, shining a light on its vulnerability to climate change.But this push was an initiative by University of the South Pacific law students in 2019 who worked to get climate justice on the UN's agenda.Vanuatu's Climate Change Minister Ralph Regenvanu, who then began raising their plight to world leaders, said the country had always led on issues of climate justice.""We were a founding member of the association of small island states and the first chairman of that group, which is now one of the main climate lobbies at COP,"" he said.""We were the country to first raise loss and damage in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1981.""We've been a leader in many ways on climate change.""With Vanuatu's cyclone season ending in May, Mr Regenvanu said the biggest concern was being unable to keep people safe amid flooding, saltwater inundation and sea level rise. ""It's happening right now, and people are not safe right now,"" he said.He said relocating entire populations from flood-prone areas and building new infrastructure was a ""huge challenge"" for the cash-strapped developing nation.""We only graduated from least developed country status less than two years ago,"" he said.""We are a very poor developing country; we don't have the necessary money we need to build resilient infrastructure like new roads to withstand the impacts of climate change, which require 10 times the investment you need for a normal road.""That's why we've been fighting for this issue of loss and damage for a long time because we really desperately need the money, and it's a problem we didn't cause."" Mr Regenvanu hopes an advisory opinion will embolden Pacific people in their fight for climate justice.""The good thing about an ICJ advisory opinion is that no matter what court you're arguing — whether it be at the lowest level or the highest level — it applies,"" he said.""It can be used in any court as a persuasive precedent."" ","Climate Change, Climate Change - Disasters, Cook Islands, Fiji, Government and Politics, Intergovernmental Organisations, International Courts and Tribunals, Kiribati, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Niue, Pacific, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, ",2023-03-29T21:07:39+00:00

It may take a long time, but it is doable.""Quotas and other temporary special measures are often touted as effective solutions but they are also controversial.""A lot of people don't think that it's democratic. But at the stage that we're in, we need some type of special measure,"" Dr Meki said. Samoa has a quota that dictates at least 10 per cent of parliamentary seats must be held by women.Fiame Naomi Mata'afa became the country's prime minister in 2021, making Samoa just the second Pacific nation ever to elect a female head of government, following the Marshall Islands with its former president Hilda Heine.While quotas could be effective at elevating women in politics, Dr Meki said a society-wide approach was needed for lasting change.""There needs to be more mainstreaming about women as leaders, not just politically … women in aviation, women in mining, different sectors, women as leaders generally.""Ms King said she led a busy life but hoped her rise to become the first female MP in Vanuatu in 15 years would encourage other women to join politics.""As a mother of four, I have a full house, I do school runs, I still do school lunches, homework … it's something that keeps me grounded.

The ABC also tried to reach Mr Kalsakau, but he did not return the ABC's calls.Tess Newton Cain, from the Griffith Asia Institute's Pacific Hub, said there was little chance the pact would be ratified by Vanuatu ""in the near term"".""Senior members of the government – including but not limited to the foreign minister – are somewhat unhappy that the prime minister made a captain's call on this, that it wasn't approved by the Council of Ministers,"" she said.Dr Newton Cain said Mr Napat was leading a broader review of Vanuatu's foreign policy, which could also delay ratification.""I think we're likely to see a fair amount of stalling. The wheels of the ratification will turn very slowly,"" she said.Australian officials had been discussing a security agreement with Vanuatu since around 2018 without ever getting it over the line.But Mr Kalsakau offered to sign the pact within weeks of winning power in November – surprising even some in Canberra.Dr Newton Cain said she understood why Australia wanted to move quickly, but the fallout showed that political support for the pact might be thin in Vanuatu.""It does expose the risks of … zeroing in one on the bit of the architecture that seems receptive rather than thinking about building a consensus across the board,"" she said.The risks are also amplified by Vanuatu's volatile national politics, where prime ministers regularly face votes of no confidence.""There are always rumours of a motion of no confidence brewing. I'm sure Kalsakau will face at least one motion of no confidence,"" Dr Newton Cain said.""I don't see this [treaty] as being enough to spark a motion, but if one is put forward it could be something that could be referred to as one of the reasons.""And it leaves everyone hanging now … it hasn't been ratified by the parliament and as things currently stand there is nothing to indicate it will be brought to ratification in the near future.""The agreement is also yet to be ratified by Australia's parliament, but both Labor and the Coalition expect it will sail smoothly through the committee process before being approved later this year.When Mr Kalsakau visited Australia in February Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told parliament he ""look[ed] forward to bipartisan support"" for the pact.Shadow Foreign Minister Simon Birmingham said the security pact was ""an important agreement that will further regional cooperation, which was initiated by the Turnbull government.""""It is crucial the Albanese government do everything possible to ensure its ratification by both nations, and not let this opportunity slip through its fingers,"" he said.A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that both prime ministers ""discussed the Bilateral Security Agreement and noted progress towards its ratification during PM Kalsakau's February visit to Canberra"".""The ratification process in the Australian parliament will commence as the parliamentary schedule allows,"" they said.""Questions on the ratification process through the Vanuatu parliament is a matter for the Government of Vanuatu.""Minister for International Development and the Pacific Pat Conroy said his visit in April to Vanuatu included discussions with the Vanuatu government about the security agreement.""We are working closely and constructively together in the spirit of a trusted partnership, including on the Bilateral Security Agreement,"" Mr Conroy said.""The recent response to the twin cyclones, including the deployment of the HMAS Canberra, demonstrates our shared commitment to our partnership as members of the Pacific family.""In times of crisis, we stand by and support each other.""The Bilateral Security Agreement builds on a strong and enhances our longstanding traditional partnership of over 42 years.""","Australia, China, Foreign Affairs, National Security, Pacific, Treaties and Alliances, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2023-05-04T19:09:02+00:00

It is a great way of deepening our strong relationships with the region.""The bills to bring the new visa scheme about will reportedly be introduced to parliament on Thursday.Last year, the visa scheme was announced in April as part of the then-opposition's wider commitment to increasing aid to the Pacific to counter China's rising influence in the region.At the time it was announced, Stephen Howes from the Australian National University said the proposal was ""unique"" and ""very significant"".""So far, all the labour mobility schemes for the Pacific have been temporary … but this is different in that it allows Pacific Islanders to move to Australia with their families and stay here,"" he said.Professor Howes said the policy seemed aimed at building up Australia's Pacific diaspora, which remains very small.""While 3,000 might not sound like a lot, those numbers will accumulate — I think you could quickly see this become more important than the temporary schemes.""In a statement the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told the ABC that boosting permanent migration to Australia was an essential part of the government's plan to ""build a stronger Pacific family"".""The Pacific Engagement Visa will grow Australia's Pacific diaspora, build on our strong people-to-people links, and encourage greater cultural, business, and educational exchange"", the statement said.According to DFAT, consultations are ongoing with regional partners to determine proposed country allocations and participation.The new visa overhauls Australia's standing Pacific labour mobility schemes, and effectively abolishes the Nationals' plan for a standalone agriculture visa by wrapping it into existing Pacific programs.Allan Bird, the governor of East Sepik Province in Papua New Guinea and a member of government, said it was a good way to solve economic issues in the region.""I think it's about time, because all the Pacific Island countries share a bond with Australia,"" he told the ABC.""There are many jobs that Australian citizens do not want to do, and I think it would be to the advantage of both Australia and South Pacific that those jobs come to the Pacific.""He said allowing Pacific Island citizens to take their families and live in Australia would help offer people on the visas a different perspective.""They get to experience the values and culture of Australia and pick up the work ethic as well, which I think is important,"" he said.""We need citizens who have a different view of the world.""Solomon Islands Permanent Secretary of Foreign Affairs Colin Beck backed the government's new visa scheme.""Any of these economic opportunities, including labour, mobility and long-term stay — that is something that is very much welcomed by Solomon Islands,"" Mr Beck told the ABC.""This is something that we have been continually working on with the Australian government.""Vanuatu Finance Minister John SalongI said he welcomes the change that is happening in Australia, but wants to see the measure go further to allow reciprocal visa-free entry for residents of Vanuatu into Australia.""We already have good exchanges between workers in Vanuatu and approved employees in Australia,"" he said.""Once the government provides that legislative environment, people will make the best choices that they will for their own selves.""For Vanuatu’s disaster-prone islands, Mr SalongI said restriction free entry to Australia for those who fit the appropriate criteria would provide much-needed opportunity for those who need to leave their homes.""Not only to move into other islands in Vanuatu, but they can also move to another place where they might have better income opportunities for themselves, and maybe better opportunities for their children in terms of access to education, access to future work, and professional upbringing,"" he said.","Australia, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Immigration, Immigration Policy, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Nauru, Pacific, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, ",2023-02-15T21:34:53+00:00
37,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-02-23/vanuatu-paves-the-way-for-cannabis-cultivation-export-/102007780,"Vanuatu has become one of the first Pacific countries to allow businesses to grow medicinal cannabis and hemp, after signing into law policies governing the import, cultivation and manufacture of the plant. It paves the way for the country to enter the global cannabis market, with some hoping the plant can become a major cash-crop for local communities.The government has made at least five 10-year licenses available for businesses to purchase – two for growing medicinal cannabis and three for hemp production – for 10 million Vatu each ($123,000).Businesses are also expected to pay an additional 10 million Vatu every year as a license renewal fee.Medicinal cannabis is most often used to relieve chronic pain and has also been used to treat anxiety, cancer-related symptoms, epilepsy, insomnia and multiple sclerosis (MS).Hemp typically has less of the psychoactive compound tetrahydrocannabinol, and can be used in products including rope, textiles, clothing, shoes, food, paper, bioplastics, insulation, and biofuel.The director-general of Vanuatu's Agricultural Department, Moses Amos, told local broadcaster VBTC the policies aimed to encourage foreign investment in the country.""The government is especially focused on alternative resources that we can use, and one of them is industrial hemp and medicinal cannabis,"" he said.""It's a potential resource that we can use and develop to become a potential export commodity for us, and at the same time bring a little money into the country.""In an attempt to mitigate the ""high risks"" associated with the cannabis industry, the government has said it will only approve licenses for companies with at least 10 years' experience in the field.That would mean only foreign businesses from countries with long-standing marijuana industries like the US would be eligible.But the move remains controversial in Vanuatu, where recreational use of the drug has a huge social stigma and remains illegal.Former police officer Isso Kapum says he used to ""chase criminals"" who smoked or sold marijuana illegally.But today he is hoping for a license to grow cannabis on his southern island, Tanna, believing it will bring development and riches to Vanuatu's people.""I did find out that it is very, very valuable to the islands of the Southern Hemisphere,"" he said.""On the island, we really have to identify a product that has demand and a product that has value and a product to sustain the people.""Mr Kapum said a chance encounter with Australian resort owner Andrew Smith first sparked his interest in hemp and cannabis farming.Together, they founded Tafea Industries, a cannabis and hemp company with plans to begin the first commercial marijuana plantation on Tanna if they gain the government's approval.Mr Smith said the pair was almost driven out of the village when they first proposed the business idea. ""The reactions just by some were quite harsh,"" he said.""But it was nothing more than opening minds and showing opportunities.""""Once we started to break it down a little bit, they started to see the opportunity of farming, the opportunity of aftermarket products.""He says Tafea Industries now has the support of tribal chiefs around the island, who have also become shareholders in the cannabis company, and believes the release of cannabis and hemp licenses marks an ""exciting"" moment for Vanuatu.Until recently, Vanuatu – like other Pacific countries – had criminalised the cultivation of cannabis.But in 2018, the government became involved with a US-based medicinal cannabis company, Phoenix Life Sciences, headed by Australian Martin Tindall, which rapidly changed the country's relationship with the controlled substance.Phoenix Life made plans to test its cannabis-derived medication on diabetes patients across the country, and it struck a non-binding agreement with the government to use its products to treat cancer in hospitals.Soon after, the government looked to amend its Dangerous Drugs Act to allow the commercial cultivation of cannabis – changes that were signed into law in 2021.Mr Tindall, however, was arrested for securities fraud in the US in 2019, halting his company's initial plans – though the ABC understands he still wishes to return to the medicinal cannabis business in Vanuatu, after he pled guilty to one count and was released from jail.Vanuatu's current government has distanced itself from Phoenix Life Sciences.Mr Amos, from the Agricultural Department, said the current legislation was ""not really"" influenced by the company.""The act was mainly driven mainly by our technicians here in Vanuatu,"" he said.""This Phoenix company operated outside the scope of the current legislation.""Despite government assurances, some people in Vanuatu are sceptical about the country's entry into the cannabis and hemp industries.Sam Naiu, the Tafea provincial Agricultural Officer from Tanna, said while the country stood to benefit financially, he feared people would abuse the drug.""On the social side, I think it's a dangerous decision that the government has made,"" Mr Naiu said.""When we're asleep in the night, someone can sneak through the fence and steal the marijuana.""He suggests the government should introduce the product in remote areas first, where population is low.""Don't go to Tanna first, but allow it in a place where it's easier to control, where security is strong and the production is safe.""But Mr Naiu also sees the potential in cannabis production for the people of Tanna.Vanilla and coffee are the primary export crops on the island, but most people earn a modest income through small-scale agriculture and the domestic sale of meat, vegetables and fruit.Mr Naiu admits cannabis could provide another lucrative cash-crop, but he believes there are other ways the government can support local farmers.""Vanuatu hasn't even exported a local root crop, but now it wants to export something like marijuana that brings risks to this place,"" he said.Other Pacific countries are considering following in Vanuatu's footsteps. Cook Islands voted to legalise marijuana for medicinal purposes in a 2022 referendum, and a ministerial team has been appointed to look into the issue.In 2014, Guam became the first US territory to allow medicinal marijuana, and in 2019 also legalised the drug for recreational use.But it has taken many years for local cannabis businesses to win approval to farm and manufacture the plant, with the first licenses for production approved only a few months ago.Charlie Hermosa from Bella Wings Aviation in Guam has applied for a license to deliver cannabis using a fleet of drones.He said the new industry can allow Pacific businesses to become global players at the forefront of cannabis production, and stop relying just on tourism dollars.""I think right now with the way the global economy is kind of working out, we're trying to position ourselves to be able to sustain economic development outside of the normal channels that most islands have,"" he said.""[We need to be] first to market, creating an environment that says, 'Hey, listen, Guam's got some great cannabis'.""And with more islands entering the cannabis market, Mr Hermosa said there could be an opportunity to create trans-Pacific businesses, including with Vanuatu.""I would really love to talk to the government down there and see if there's an opportunity.""","Drug and Substance

One has even been tracked to swim across to California. Leatherbacks are truly incredible creatures. They can weigh up to a ton, yet can dive down to depths of over a kilometre, spend over an hour underwater on a single breath, and can hit speed bursts faster than a bottlenose dolphin.They are the fastest, largest and are the most ancient  of all sea turtles. The turtle's co-mascot — and namesake — has things a bit easier.Soon the other Solo — and its entourage — will complete their six-month tour through Solomon Islands nine provinces.This month Solo will visit 26 communities and villages during its final trip in Malaita province.Upright, and with dance moves and hugs for all, the polyester and foam mascot is hyping the Pacific Games to be held this November, and spreading a turtle conservation message across the islands at the same time.Solomon Islands boast some of the largest turtle nesting grounds in the Pacific.Sea turtles are intrinsic to the archipelago's culture.For thousands of years, the green, hawksbill and leatherback sea turtles have followed an ancestral, biological drive to lay their eggs on the same beaches in Solomon Islands every mating cycle.However, despite many tribes considering the gentle creatures a sacred animal, the latter half of the 20th century was catastrophic for sea turtles.Commercial harvesting for shells and meat, as well as egg collection, has driven populations to near extinction.All three Solomon Islands nesting species are classified as endangered, with the hawksbill and Western Pacific leatherback reaching ""critically endangered"" status.Current adult female numbers of hawkbill turtles that nest in Solomon Islands are believed to have dwindled to a few thousand, whereas the number of adult leatherback turtles that nest in Solomon Islands are in the hundreds.However, Solomon Islands has been fighting the devastation for decades, with some success.Marine conservation areas and protected zones, paired with community-led ranger programs, have make an impact.The 40,000-acre Arnavon Islands Community Marine Park was the first nationally protected area in Solomon Islands, established in 1995.Some reports attribute a 200 per cent increase of hawksbill nests to the Arnavon's protection status.The Nature Conservancy (TNC) says hawksbill turtles dig around 2,000 nests a year within the marine park.TNC has been working in Solomon Islands for 30 years and has partnered with the Pacific Games Organising Committee (GOC) for the 2023 Pacific Games.Also tracking Solo the leatherback, the TNC will continue to release the data of her travels leading up to the November kick of for the games.Solomon Islands latest conservation initiative is proving a winner.A highlight was when the turtle mascot released a live hawksbill back into a Marine Protected Area from Boe Boe Village in Choiseul province.""Seeing Solo, a sea turtle, being the Games Official Mascot gives us even more joy,"" Boe Boe village elder Derald Daza Daniel said.Mr Daniel echoed similar sentiments shared by those in the other provinces that Solo has visited, with the mascot's nationwide tour making people feel part of the Pacific Games.Games chief executive Peter Stewart said he was hopeful the messages both Solos could spread awareness throughout Solomon Islands to help protect sea turtles for many years to come.""These creatures are so important to the culture and biodiversity of Solomon Islands and the Pacific region,"" Stewart said.Solomon Islands will host this year's Pacific Games between November 19 and December 2.","Animals and Nature, Conservation, Endangered and Protected Species, Environment, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Sport, Vanuatu, ",2023-02-03T02:23:21+00:00

It's just crystal clear,"" Alex said.Suzie and Alex had found the island of their dreams.Now, all they had to do was tell the accountant.""We sat down, we said, 'We're going to buy an island',"" Suzie recalled.""And he was just like, 'No, you're not, no'.""The accountant went on to list the challenges facing the couple, from not knowing ni-Vanuatu culture, to the risks of buying property overseas.Warren Moore — a real estate agent in Vanuatu who sold Alex and Suzie the island — said the accountant was right to be cautious.""Too often, I have seen people who think they have purchased a 'bargain' and they have no documentation and no title,"" he said.""They think they have saved money by avoiding an agent and, in many cases, have lost all that they have paid and have nothing to show for it.""Many Pacific countries have introduced regulations to control the sale of Indigenous land to foreigners.These include strict ""titles"" over the land, which — rather than conferring ownership — allow foreigners to lease the land from traditional owners (usually chiefs or villages) for a set period of time.In Vanuatu, leases are granted for up to 75 years. In Fiji, it's often 99 years.""It's important to understand that [customary landowners] have never lost their land, as all titles are leasehold,"" Mr Moore said of Vanuatu's laws.""Provided that the purchasers respect the people — and respect and look after and improve the property and pay their land rent — then the Indigenous 'kastom' (custom) owners are happy with the situation.""Despite the regulations, some Indigenous Pacific Islanders say the laws don't go far enough.In Vanuatu, about 10 per cent of Indigenous land is under lease, with rates particularly high in cities, where almost half of all land is no longer under Indigenous control.The country's Minister for Climate Change and former lands minister, Ralph Regenvanu, recently co-authored a research paper, suggesting more protections were needed to ensure Indigenous, or kastom, land wasn't sold off to foreigners.""Leasing customary land, particularly where it results in the eviction of the Indigenous population — as is increasingly happening in Vanuatu — has profound implications,"" Mr Regenvanu wrote with his co-author Siobhan McDonnell from the Australian National University.""It is concerning that issues of large-scale land leasing and Indigenous dispossession have occurred in post-colonial Indigenous-governed states, including Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea.""Fijian historian Tarisi Vunidilo says private islands can alienate generations of Indigenous people from their homeland.""As Indigenous Fijians, land is more than just the physical entity that we see on islands or in places where we come from. Land is, you know, very spiritual, it also connects to our cultural identity,"" Dr Vunidilo said.In one infamous case reported by media at the time, people claiming to be the Indigenous landowners of Mago, a Fijian island, took owner Mel Gibson to court, alleging the land had been stolen from their families generations ago.It's understood the case was eventually abandoned.However, Dr Vunidilo said there were many other instances where Indigenous people were removed from their islands hundreds of years ago and contemporary titles may not acknowledge their authority over the land.""Some of the sales were very questionable, particularly of land that was sold by chiefs themselves, or land that was forced to be sold by pressure from the colonial government,"" she said.""So, there's a lot of other examples like the island of Rabi, the island of Kioa, they were sold under dubious circumstances, and the people who lived there were forcibly relocated to other places.""In other cases, the wealth invested on private islands exposes uncomfortable inequalities with the surrounding populations.Kim Kardashian stirred controversy on a private island during the pandemic, celebrating her 40th birthday on Marlon Brando's private French Polynesian island while much of the world spent their milestones isolated in lockdown.Google co-founder Larry Page — who owns a Fijian island — was another celebrity reportedly able to ride out much of the COVID-19 pandemic in Fiji, at a time when the country, whose borders were closed, was struggling with high infection rates and economic losses.""Some say that an island is the ultimate status symbol,"" Mr Moore said.""However, I don't see any of my island-buying clients as people who flaunt their possessions.""Mr Moore has sold more than a dozen private islands in Vanuatu, mostly to wealthy foreigners, either keen for a ""sea change"" or to develop the islands into lucrative resorts.He said the pandemic had led to a ""small flurry"" of interest in private island sales when borders opened in 2022.After speaking with their accountant, Alex and Suzie decided to take their time before signing the lease documents for Mamasa.They were put in touch with the Canadian couple selling the island, who put their minds to rest about the risky venture.By April 2018, the island was theirs.""It's been the best decision that we've ever made,"" Suzie said.Alex said there had been ""some friction"" with Indigenous landowners, particularly when it came to land access.However, he says, he's tried hard to overcome culture shock and engage with local communities, even learning the local Bislama language.""The ni-Vanuatu, they were trying so hard to communicate with me, which I just really respected,"" he said.""I just thought, 'Well, if they're making the effort, I'm going to make the effort to integrate'.""Mr Regenvanu said existing laws provided adequate protections for Indigenous people, but enforcement can be a problem.""The laws are essentially OK,"" he said, ""they just need more resourcing, so the government can respond to demand from Indigenous citizens for resolution of disputed land.""Meanwhile, Dr Vunidilo said it was possible for Indigenous landowners to also reap benefits from private island sales, as long as foreign owners were respectful.""Be familiar with what land means to us,"" she said.""If they understand that, that can help them make an informed decision in owning islands or owning land in Fiji.""","Australia, Colonialism, Fiji, French Polynesia, Human Interest, Indigenous (Other Peoples), Indigenous Culture, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Travel and Tourism (Lifestyle and Leisure), Vanuatu, ",2023-01-06T19:18:04+00:00

Like a drunken feeling,"" the Shadow Minister for the Pacific explained.Throughout this week's tour of three Pacific nations, a bi-partisan parliamentary delegation led by Foreign Minister Penny Wong was welcomed with traditional ceremonies which included the Australian MPs drinking kava.On Wednesday the cross-party group arrived in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) for a meeting with President David Panuelo, followed by a formal reception marking 35 years of diplomatic relations with Australia.Vision captured by an ABC television camera shows the visibly ill Riverina MP being attended to by travelling staff members, before being helped to a waiting car by DFAT staff and an AFP officer.He was then rushed from the Congress building to a nearby medical clinic for observations and tests, before being discharged and spending the night in the Australian ambassador's residence.The medical drama meant the Shadow Minister for the Pacific was unable to fly onto Palau, the final scheduled destination of the parliamentary delegation's four-day trip.Minister for the Pacific Pat Conroy was also stranded in FSM for the night after his Air Force jet broke down meaning he was unable to separately return to Canberra for Thursday's parliamentary sitting.Both men were collected the following day by the delegation which flew back to FSM from Palau, before returning to Australia on Friday morning.Mr McCormack joked DFAT would now need to enact the ""McCormack principle"" by warning politicians about sakau consumption before future Micronesian visits.""I actually think it'll be on the next briefing papers — I think it'll be in bold, I think it'll be underlined, may even be printed in red,"" he laughed.Despite the ordeal the former Nationals leader said he would continue to drink kava when visiting the Pacific, ""but if I'm up north, I'll be just taking a sip as Penny (Wong) sensibly did"".""When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

politicians on Friday and now leads a 30-member coalition involving five parties.He acknowledged the previous government's ""knowledge and wisdom"" that guided Vanuatu through the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic turmoil.The new PM also thanked Australia for providing defence force aircraft and helicopters during the snap election.""I want to thank the government of Australia, who assisted us with swift support and facilitated smooth transportation of ballot boxes to remote places in Vanuatu,"" he said.""I want to thank all people of the Republic of Vanuatu … who elected members of the current legislature.""Now it's time for us to deliver on your expectations.""The election outcome follows more than two weeks of negotiations between elected MPs to form government, with two political blocs emerging to contest the leadership — one convened by the then-prime minister Bob Loughman, the other by former opposition leader Ralph Regenvanu.Mr Kalsakau's Union of Moderates Parties (UMP) was previously aligned with Mr Loughman, but the UMP chose to side with political rivals in order to secure a majority in the country's parliament.Despite shifting allegiances, Mr Loughman made the unexpected decision to support his former deputy as prime minister, nominating him as leader in parliament on Friday.""It was always the intention of our group to elect the nominee of the other side [Mr Kalsakau] to become prime minister,"" Mr Loughman said.The prime minister's appointment brings to close a dramatic chapter in Vanuatu politics, after Mr Loughman dissolved parliament in August to avoid a vote of no confidence against his government.According to the opposition, dissolving parliament was unconstitutional and unlawful, but a court ruled the decision was legal, triggering the country's snap election.Ishmael Kalsakau is a veteran politician, who has served as attorney-general and then leader of the opposition for several years.Since 2020, he has been deputy prime minister in Mr Loughman's government.Mr Kalsakau was recently elected as leader of his UMP party, and he has been a vocal critic of China's influence in the Pacific nation.While leader of the opposition in 2018, he criticised China's growing influence in the Pacific, telling the ABC that Vanuatu was ""blindly accepting the intervention of countries like China"" without adequate scrutiny.In government, Mr Kalsakau has led controversial attempts to reform Vanuatu's land laws by expanding powers of government ministers to lease Indigenous land.As a mother, business operator and now politician, Gloria Julia King knows her new lifestyle will be a tricky balancing act.She is the first female politician to be elected to Vanuatu's parliament in 14 years and hopes her victory inspires other women.""I'm hoping to be able to advise, from this vantage point, as to how we can work towards getting more women into parliament,"" Ms King told the ABC's Pacific Beat.Ms King is also only the sixth woman to be elected to Vanuatu's parliament since independence in 1980.""A female voice in parliament lets all people in Vanuatu know that there is a female voice up there representing them,"" she said.Ms King's election was one of the significant outcomes of Vanuatu's snap election, held on October 13.The Pacific has one of the lowest rates of female representation in politics.Prior to Ms King's election, Vanuatu was one of only a handful of countries in the world with no women in government.Anne Pakoa — the founder of the Vanuatu Human Rights Coalition — said the election marked a ""big moment"" for women in the country.""It's a celebration for everyone,"" she said.""We've waited a long time for this … I'm proud Julia got in, because she's one of the prominent women leaders and I know she has a strong voice.""Several women ran in the recent election and, in 2020, an all-female party was formed to try to improve gender balance in parliament. That attempt failed but, with the Ms King taking up her seat in parliament, there are hopes other women will follow in her footsteps.Melissa Fare — a communications professional and ni-Vanuatu student in Australia — said the election of Ms King was an inspiration to young women in the country.""I'm a young woman who is very heavily into politics … Julia is setting the example and now Julia is going to be a role model,"" she said.   Vanuatu-based journalist Dan McGarry also welcomed the election of Ms King to parliament, saying it marked the ""beginning of a movement"" in Vanuatu. ""Julia's victory is a victory for all women in Vanuatu, and that's something that nobody can take away from her or from the women of Vanuatu,"" he said.""We should have six or eight women who are superlative candidates who did stand, who are yet to be elected, who could do as good or better job than any man that's currently there.""I think that this is a grave injustice to the women of Vanuatu, to the people of Vanuatu generally.""Mr McGarry added that, under the new coalition government, there would likely be a ""continuation of policies"", including a focus on reviving the tourism sector, development projects and continuing a fight for climate justice in the world's highest court.  Ni-Vanuatu woman Gwen Amankwah-Toa — who lives in Brisbane — said she was relieved people were able to make their frustrations with the former government known through their vote.However, she added, the decision to hold a snap election on October 13 was partly ""disappointing"", because of the costs involved.""For democracy's sake, it was good that they went to elections so the people can decide who they want to be in government,"" she said.And, she said, she was also relieved to see

Instead they would receive digital non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have more famously been used to certify artwork.""One day I got contacted, and [was asked]: 'Hey, would you be interested in running operations? We've got this great idea',"" Mr Troyak said.Mr Troyak was hooked. Without visiting Vanuatu where the project would be based, he agreed, becoming the project's logistical director and spokesperson. Earlier this year, Mr Troyak shut his busy Surry Hills cafe and moved to the Pacific country of Vanuatu to live and work full-time on Satoshi Island.The project is named after Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the creator of the digital cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.For those steeped in the world of cryptocurrency, Satoshi Island is a fantasy coming to life, a revolutionary experiment to create a new, decentralised society built entirely on cutting-edge technology.The team behind it are committed to making that dream a reality.Ardent supporters have already snapped up plots on the remote island using cryptocurrency, buying ""Land Deed NFTs"" stored on the blockchain.However, with a litany of logistical and legal hurdles between the vision for Satoshi Island and its reality, experts say investors need to be wary, and fear the project may eventually fall flat or run foul of local laws.The company's slick website promises Satoshi Island will soon transform into a high-tech city, built from the ground up by a global community of cryptocurrency enthusiasts.Hundreds of families are set to live in oblong, modular homes, stacked on top of each other like massive glass Lego blocks by the sea.Their goal is for every aspect of people's lives to be mediated by cryptocurrency.Coffee and rent could be paid for with digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.Cryptocurrency startups are being encouraged to buy land to create a commercial centre for the digital economy.Proponents such as Satoshi Island's architect, James Law, said it could be a real-world case study for what a future community might look like, governed entirely online by the blockchain.""I think we are very brave entrepreneurs who are putting our skills and resources into the project, earnestly trying to make it into something truly special,"" he said.Most countries, including Vanuatu, don't recognise digital currency as legal tender, nor do they have regulations to oversee crypto markets, which are notoriously unstable, making it risky to trade or invest in them.However, Satoshi Island is attempting to remove many barriers to crypto trading. Instead of national banks, politicians or courts controlling the community, the company hopes to use blockchain — a technology that can store information without risk of it being changed, hacked or corrupted — to ensure money or property isn't stolen.It sounds utopian, and for sceptics like software engineer and prominent cryptocurrency critic Molly White, that's the point.She said Satoshi Island was just one in a ""long line"" of naive cryptocurrency projects set on tropical islands.""There's been a lot of energy and money put into convincing people that this is the future of technology, the future of the web, the future of society,"" she said.""A lot of that really just doesn't stand up to scrutiny. But it does work very well for convincing people to put their money into it.""Ms White said ""less-glamorous"" aspects — such as waste management on a remote island, food distribution and even electrification — were not considered in many crypto island plans. Ellie Rennie, from RMIT University's blockchain innovation hub, said there was potential for blockchain technology to re-imagine how societies might operate.""They're often talking about the possibilities of automating certain functions of the state,"" Professor Rennie said.""Many of those tasks can be done through technologies more efficiently and, so, that raises the possibility of alternative societies forming and alternative nations.""However, she added, it was ""too early"" to predict if any of the proposed cryptocurrency utopias would work, and with that uncertainty there was risk.""In some cases, they are experiments in doing things differently. They're a form of exit from nation states,"" she said.""The problem is that others can pick up on these narratives and hopes and ideologies and exploit them for financial gain.""At the moment, the island — called Lataro by locals — is an unruly, tropical forest.It's about 800 acres, a bit bigger than Sydney's CBD, and ""90 per cent untouched by man"", according to a real estate notice advertising the island.The island is mostly uninhabited, but a family of Indigenous landowners have ultimate custody of the land, and can lease it out to companies such as Satoshi Island to develop and use.Philip Warele negotiated the deal with Denys Troyak and the Satoshi Island company.He does not know much about cryptocurrency but is optimistic about the opportunities that Satoshi Island offers.""We knew it would improve the economy of Vanuatu and bring money into the country,"" he said.Mr Troyak and the team have employed around 10 members of his family, and Mr Warele says another 10 will join the team soon.The company also made payments to Mr Warele's family — another reason why he says he is happy for the partnership.As to whether Satoshi Island investors can buy physical property with cryptocurrency, Mr Warele said that would be impossible.""My understanding is that they're not selling plots, but they're just renting out the plots,"" he said.""There's one man who has paid for a lease, so we have an agreement with him. But, for him to sell land inside the island, that's not possible.""Mr Troyak told the ABC ""one cannot own land in Vanuatu"" and ""NFT holders have exclusive rights to the blocks of land on Satoshi Island"". But he did not elaborate on why the company's website and promotional material states ""anyone can own a piece of the island"".Although they don't give any property rights to customers, the asking prices for Satoshi Island Land NFT Deeds range from $900 to $11,000.In January, the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission (VFSC) issued a public notice which said the operation ""could be a scam"".The financial services regulator said that, because Satoshi Island did not have a licence to trade in digital assets, what it was advertising online was false and misleading.A few months later, Satoshi Island claimed the notice was damaging to their business and took legal action against the commission.VFSC said it had to remove the notice while the case was pending, and that the matter was still before the Vanuatu courts. Mr Troyak did not respond to ABC's questions about why his company took legal action against the VFSC.In February, Vanuatu's acting financial minister, Johnny Koanapo Rusao, told the ABC he supported Satoshi Island in principle, but said that Vanuatu's legislation needed to be updated to provide adequate oversight on the project.""We need to have legislations updated so they can absorb the implementation of the cryptocurrencies,"" he said.Mr Troyak said Satoshi Island's legal team were ensuring the project would be lawful.""We feel very strongly that the legislations of the Vanuatu government will come through, and it's going to be friendly to us,"" Mr Troyak said.""We're going to make sure we go through to our lawyers locally, and make sure everything is clear.""Professor Rennie said there was a ""clear precedent"" of cryptocurrency schemes making promises they they could not fulfil, and urged potential investors to be cautious.""There's a very fine line between a scam and a failed business project,"" she said. ""Ultimately, it's up to anyone who is interested in participating in these things to look very, very closely at what they think it is, and to know the risk.""According to Vanuatu's land management department, Mr Troyak and his team do not have the rights to Lataro Island.In lease title documents obtained by ABC, the Satoshi Island company is directed by Theresa Jane Allen, a long-time property developer in Vanuatu.The ABC was unable to contact Ms Allen, and her name is not listed on Satoshi Island's website, promotional material, nor on any of the company's NFT land agreements.Mr Troyak said Ms Allen was ""not part of the Satoshi Island team"", and said Satoshi Island's Land Deed NFTs were sold by another organisation, registered as a non-profit in the Marshall Islands. He did not answer questions about who financially benefits from the Satoshi Island project.Despite lack of clarity around the company's ownership, legal experts say it is unlikely the company would face barriers in Vanuatu's courts.Vanuatu lawyer Didier Hamel-Landry said that, as long as investors were clear they could not buy Vanuatu land using NFTs, Satoshi Island's activities were lawful.""In Vanuatu law, there's enough flexibility in the legal system and in the rules for such a project to go ahead and to exist,"" Mr Hamel-Landry said.Compared to countries such as Australia, Mr Hamel-Landry said Vanuatu did not have robust tenant, property or foreign investment rights.Instead, he said, land agreements — such as the one with Satoshi Island — were made personally between customary landowners and developers.""It doesn't guarantee that it's a good idea and a sound investment, of course … My advice to anyone investing in that particular project, or any project generally, would be to make serious due diligence and look at who they're dealing with,"" he said.Ms White said underdeveloped property laws could be the reason why cryptocurrency enthusiasts experimented in countries like Vanuatu.""The reason that they want to do this in some remote island versus in London or New York City or someplace that is fairly established already, is that they want to create basically a micronation, where they can create their own rules,"" she said.""I think the majority of people who are actually putting money into these projects are speculating … are hoping to flip the NFTs, based on news coverage.""Satoshi Island is one of a number of blockchain and cryptocurrency experiments in the Pacific.In Fiji, a similar cryptocurrency ""paradise"" called Cryptoland was attempted but, after being widely mocked, the project eventually ran aground for failing to secure the island.Despite these concerns, some of Satoshi Island's supporters remain undeterred.Monty Metzger — founder and chief executive of a blockchain platform called LCX — has long been a fan of Satoshi Island.""Participating in Satoshi Island is a fun thing. I want to learn how they are doing it, and I want to see how much interest it will gain,"" he said.""I'm always skeptical, but I'm also enthusiastic … I also would not put my life savings into it but rather participate, like being part of a club.""","Cryptocurrency, Internet, Internet Culture, Lifestyle and Leisure, Mobile and Internet Access, Pacific, Vanuatu, ",2022-10-10T20:32:40+00:00

I got resignations on a Thursday, and they stopped coming from Saturday.""In April, the Australian government expanded the Pacific Australian Labor Mobility Scheme (PALM) to include hospitality, tourism, and aged care in a bid to address critical skills shortages. The move came as tourism in Fiji was just gaining momentum after reopening from COVID-19 border closures.On his visit to Fiji last month, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese spruiked the scheme, telling reporters it was ""good for Australia"" to help fill workforce gaps, but also ""good for our Pacific island neighbours"", especially as it allows more women to participate in the scheme. However, the move hasn't been so positive for local businesses with workers abandoning their jobs during peak season.Shakil Zoro Bhamji used to employ 95 staff across his cafe chain Coffee Hub.But he has lost around 20 workers this year, with many leaving on short notice as soon as their Australian visas were approved.""They will literally just abandon the workplace and leave. So that has been really, really frustrating, unfortunately,"" Mr Bhamji said. He said they are ""standing on one leg"", caught in a constant loop of hiring new staff only to lose them again. ""That's just how the turnover is. They get approached by the hotels, because the hotels continuously lose staff for this work scheme,"" Mr Bhamji said. His cafes are now operating on reduced hours with Mr Bhamji recruiting students to fill gaps, regardless of their abilities. ""We are basically living from day to day with recruitment, and now most of my staff have zero experience,"" he said. ""I feel like now we live in a world where our customers are more informed than our staff.""Fantasha Lockington, the CEO of the Fiji Hotel and Tourism Association, said they have always had a cyclical movement of workers going to Australia and New Zealand but it has ""simply ramped up"".""It's now nine months on [since Fiji reopened] and we're experiencing a very positive high season, but one that also coincides with both Australia and New Zealand opening up fully and also requiring workers,"" she said. ""We understand it's going to happen, it's just happened at a level that we've never seen before.""Tourism Fiji has been training up locals to fill the gaps, but Ms Lockington wants the Australian government to also consider Pacific businesses' needs.""What we'd like to see is a little bit more discussion about how they can support a bit more training, rather than simply making it easier for them to go across,"" she said. A spokesperson from Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) said by supporting Pacific workers to develop new skills or upskill it provides a ""skills dividend to Pacific countries"".They added that it was up to Pacific countries to regulate how they handle their mobility flows.""PALM scheme partner countries have their own labour mobility policies and control who can register in their work-ready pool,"" the spokesperson said.""The Australian government respects partner country decisions on where they focus their efforts on labour mobility.""It is not just businesses in Fiji that are being affected.Across the region, staff shortages are the main challenge for the tourism industry as workers seek more lucrative opportunities in Australia and New Zealand.At the end of last month, there were close to 26,600 PALM workers in Australia, according to a Department of Employment and Workplace Relations spokesperson.Between May and July, around 4,792 workers arrived under the scheme.A pool of more than 50,000 have been pre-screened and are awaiting job offers. Under the scheme, these jobs can be filled for up to nine months, but longer-term roles for between one and four years can also be considered. Samoa predicted that staff shortages would be an issue when it reopened to tourists this month.Tutuila Farao, a spokesperson from the Samoa Tourism Authority, said they had been training staff during COVID to prepare.But as more workers head overseas they are ""back to basics"", having to find students to train from scratch, he said. When Vanuatu opened to tourists in July, Paul Pilo from the country's tourism office voiced the same concerns. Ni-Vanuatu make up the largest pool of seasonal workers in Australia.Recently, 24 workers from Vanuatu arrived in the Northern Territory to take up work at the remote Kings Canyon Resort.Matt Lang, the Chief Operating Officer of G'Day Group which runs the resort, said the Pacific workers have been crucial. ""Without the PALM workers we couldn't support the increased demand and capacity at Kings Canyon,"" he said. He sees the scheme as a ""win-win"" for Australia and the Pacific as workers return home with skills that will benefit local business. ""They get a great wage and we give them quality training and an experience that enables them to further their careers and improve the job prospects,"" Mr Lang said. ""These are also transferable skills that they can take back home.""Mayline Vinic decided to come to Australia and work at Discovery Kings Canyon for the experience and to support her family. ""It was important to me to help my family back home,"" she said. The Australian government has said PALM workers on average can send around $6,000 a year back to their country.So far, Ms Vinic is enjoying her time at the resort and plans to come back next year. But she also hopes to put her new skills to use back in Vanuatu.""It helps to have the training we've received here,"" she said.""We can use the skills we've learnt to train other Ni-Vans back home.""","Australia, Community and Society, Fiji, Government and Politics, Hospitality Industry, Pacific, Samoa, Tourism and Leisure Industry, Vanuatu, ",2022-08-28T18:04:23+00:00

57,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-07-10/pacific-spiralling-debt-problem-pif/101222218,"Rising debt and declining income seem to add up to an austere future for Pacific Island nations. But belt-tightening may make things worse.As nations converge in Fiji for the Pacific Island Forum starting tomorrow, the whole region is in recession, according to a late-2021 International Monetary Fund report.Income is down and spending is up. Global demand for regional exports has declined, and COVID-19 shut down the vital tourism sector.Meanwhile, countries have had to meet the expense of managing both the pandemic and climate change. It has all pushed Pacific nations into greater risk of debt distress. But austerity measures are only likely to undermine the region's economic recovery.GDP declined by an average of 2.4 per cent in 2021, on top of a 3.7 per cent slide in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic hit tourism-dependent economies such as Fiji, Palau, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu hard — they saw an average economic contraction of 6.5 per cent in 2021. Declining global demand also adversely impacted commodity-exporting countries such as Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu.With falling GDP and a rise in public spending to cushion the ravages of the pandemic, Pacific countries find themselves in a sovereign debt crisis.United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) country reports show that for Pacific countries, the debt-to-GDP ratio, a commonly used benchmark, has increased from an average of 32 per cent in 2019 (before COVID) to 42.2 per cent in 2021. Fiji and Palau have a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 80 per cent and 70 per cent respectively.The worrying debt levels and growing climate crisis are constraining governments' ability to invest in public services. Remoteness from global markets and the geography of Pacific Island economies means high infrastructure costs. Remoteness also drives up import costs for capital equipment, mineral fuels and other intermediate goods.The island nations are now further witnessing an increase in prices, especially for essential commodities, due to pandemic-induced supply disruptions and the Russia–Ukraine war.The Pacific's vulnerability to natural disasters and climate-induced shocks adds to infrastructure costs because greater original investment is now needed to build climate-resilient infrastructure. Maintenance expenses are also higher because of recurrent damage. Increasing climate-related extreme events are making Pacific debt levels more precarious.Pacific countries are now at greater risk of debt distress, according to a recent debt-sustainability analysis by the IMF and World Bank.Seven low-income Pacific Island countries — Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, PNG, Samoa, Tonga and Tuvalu — are at high risk of debt distress. Solomon Islands and Vanuatu are at moderate risk of debt distress, but they both have very limited capacity to absorb shocks. Timor-Leste, previously rated as low risk, is now rated by the IMF as at moderate risk of debt distress.For middle-income countries like Fiji, Nauru and Palau, IMF assessment shows debt is sustainable, but in the case of Fiji, the debt situation has worsened and is subject to increased risk. The Asian Development Bank, while downgrading Fiji's creditworthiness, noted sustained deterioration in Fiji's debt sustainability, which has increased its risk of being unable to fulfil its financial obligations.Most of the Pacific's external debt is with multilateral agencies as opposed to bilateral creditors, according to World Bank data. The Asian Development Bank is the major creditor for countries such as Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu, holding about 38 per cent of all external debt, followed by China (22 per cent), the World Bank (13 per cent), and Australia and Japan (6 per cent). Chinese loans are less than half of the total in Fiji, PNG, Vanuatu and Samoa.But Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu are among the world's most indebted countries to China. In 2020, these countries owed China the equivalent of $US1.6 billion ($2.3 billion). Tonga, with more than 55 per cent Chinese debt as a share of total external debt and in the high-risk category of debt distress, needs to be cautious in bilateral dealings.A constant trade deficit and high debt levels may lead Pacific Island governments to adopt austerity measures in order to build fiscal capacity. This is likely to worsen poverty and inequality in the region and undermine economic recovery. Rapid fiscal consolidation can also have adverse implications for moving towards a climate-resilient Pacific and achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.Pacific Island countries urgently need to improve their finances so they can invest in economic recovery and development and undertake climate adaptation and mitigation measures.To do this, they need substantial financial resources. Grants and access to concessional financing will be critical for the Pacific. The existing international financial architecture and particularly the debt architecture do not adequately consider the vulnerabilities of the Pacific Island countries.Pacific Island countries need long-term financing. The World Bank estimates that Pacific Islands require more than 10 per cent of their GDP annually and an additional 5 to 10 per cent of GDP for climate and disaster resilience costs until 2040.The gap between potential and actual revenue is significant in the Pacific, UNESCAP estimates show, and so Pacific Island countries could consider domestic economic activity to increase their revenue.Pacific nations have substantial advantages in agriculture, manufacturing and other value-adding activities, but these sectors face challenges such as high operational costs due to capital and transport costs, consistent supply of materials, and the disconnect between the motivation to commercialise and the requisite political confidence, policies and resources. These issues need to be deliberately addressed.If Pacific Island countries are to beat a path towards the sustainable expansion of financial and technical services, while balancing fundamental infrastructure development and institutional reforms, and managing national debt, they will need to work with development partners and multilateral agencies.Day-to-day management of public finance in the Pacific has improved, according to ADB's Pacific Economic Monitor series, but it remains an area for further capacity building. Experience from other developing economies highlights the need for developing a comprehensive approach, including strengthening investment priorities, public financial-management planning via short- to medium-term frameworks, and wider public-sector reforms to improve operational efficiencies.Appropriate debt financing can play a crucial role in meeting long-term development needs in the Pacific. But strong transparency, accountability and effective debt monitoring are required to meet future debt obligation concerns and associated constraints on domestic resources.Governments of the Pacific Islands must lead this process, having a firm commitment to prudent fiscal discipline through proactive policy approaches and investments in areas with sustainable and significant economic returns. It is crucial for the Pacific's long-term fiscal sustainability and supporting the wellbeing of Pacific communities.Keshmeer Makun is a lecturer in economics at the School of Accounting, Finance and Economics at the University of the South Pacific in Suva, Fiji.

But I would not be surprised if that is the case,"" Dr Kabutaulaka said.Tess Newton Cain, project lead at the Griffith Asia Institute's Pacific Hub, said it would be naive to believe the US was not influencing Guam's PIF push.""From the US point of view, given their avowed intention to be much more engaged in the region, they would see it as very beneficial,"" she said.""You're able to sit at that top table, if you like.""Guam's desire to join the PIF is likely to cause a stir among Pacific nations.Established in 1971 with the goal of enhancing regional cooperation, the forum was originally comprised only of independent Pacific nations.""I think it's important to remember that decolonisation in the Pacific was a founding principle for the establishment of the Pacific Islands Forum,"" Dr Newton Cain said.""There would be a question to be asked about whether allowing Guam to become a full member is in full alignment with that.""But Dr Newton Cain also pointed to a precedent set when the French territories of New Caledonia and French Polynesia were granted PIF membership in 2016.The decision was made partly on the basis that both territories had made significant steps towards gaining independence and were registered on the United Nations decolonisation list at the time.While Guam's Indigenous Chamorro people have campaigned for independence from the United States, the movement is not as formalised.""I'm not aware of any kind of pathway that's in place,"" Dr Newton Cain said.Mr Tenorio said it would be inconceivable to deny Guam's inclusion.""What would the difference be?"" he asked.""Guam has one non-voting delegate to the United States House of Representatives. So we even have less direct involvement in the national affairs of the United States.""He said Guam had received a ""tremendous amount of support"" from Pacific leaders when discussing its desire to join the forum.Federated States of Micronesia President David Panuelo said Guam's potential membership of PIF was a conversation well worth having.""Although often seen by outsiders as purely a territory or component unit of the United States, Guam – in a manner not dissimilar to New Caledonia and French Polynesia, or Niue and Cook Islands – is a self-governing Pacific Island,"" he told ABC.Mr Panuelo noted that Guam was already a member of other Pacific agencies, including the Pacific Island Development Program and the Pacific Community.""The Federated States of Micronesia understands and respects Guam's position and interest to join the Pacific Islands Forum,"" he said.Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs said it was aware of Guam's interest in joining the forum.New Zealand's Foreign Ministry said any decisions on membership of the PIF would need to be made by forum leaders on the basis of consensus.Other Pacific nations, including Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea have not responded to the ABC's requests for comment.Guam's bid to join the PIF comes at a tumultuous time for the regional body.Earlier this year, Kiribati announced its decision to leave the body after a year-long leadership dispute involving Micronesian countries.Dr Kabutaulaka said the dispute over Guam's inclusion could further destabilise the PIF.""Pacific Island countries might say 'our premier political organisation … is now being taken over by powers, such as the US, France, and therefore it is no longer worth being a member',"" Dr Kabutaulaka said.""I think with the current geopolitical discussions and competition that's taking place, some Pacific Island countries will push back on this.""He said there was potential for other US territories in the Pacific, including American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands, to follow Guam's lead and also apply for PIF membership.Dr Newton Cain pointed to potential governance issues.As an unincorporated US territory, Guam does not have the ability to exercise its own foreign policy and may not be able to sign treaties and agreements central to the PIF.""The more we have these members that … don't necessarily have the requisite amount of power to fully participate, then it can make things very complicated."" Dr Newton Cain said.She said the possible storage of nuclear weapons on Guam would be at odds with anti-nuclear proliferation pacts signed by PIF members.""Whether there are or are not nuclear weapons on Guam is not something that gets talked about in public,"" she said.""But I think there would certainly be some concern that having Guam as a member could cause problems on that score.""Issues may also arise from a pending review of the PIF's regional architecture.Solomon Islands cited the review when announcing an intention to hold off on signing a joint declaration with the US last month, although it did eventually endorse the pact.Soli Middleby, a former Australian diplomat to the Pacific, said Pacific leaders may want to complete the review before considering Guam's request to join the forum.""A lot of these questions around membership, how you engage, what the right set up for the Pacific Islands Forum should be fleshed out and discussed within that process,"" she said.""I think these things are always contentious.

The ABC has approached the Solomon Islands Ministry of Foreign Affairs and External Trade for comment.During Mr Wang's visit, Kiribati signed 10 documents to ""elevate cooperation"" on the BRI, climate change, livelihood projects, disaster risk reduction, road infrastructure, tourism, the dispatching of medical teams, COVID-19 supplies and marine transportation for the Line Islands.Additionally, Global Times, an English-language Chinese state media tabloid, reported cooperation agreements on trade, renewable energy and customs inspection were signed.The Kiribati government said it would release details of the visit later.When the Chinese delegation touched down in Kiribati last month, the atoll nation was focused on trade and tourism opportunities with China and was not keen on a security arrangement, according to a Kiribati official who was not authorised to speak to the media.While there had been much speculation over a controversial plan to reopen a protected marine zone for commercial fishing, and to upgrade a World War II-era airstrip on Canton Island, the official said these were not among the agreements due to be signed. Since switching diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in 2019, Kiribati has said it would open the 400,000 square-kilometre Phoenix Islands Protected Area — one of the world's largest marine conservation zones — to fishing.Western critics have expressed concern the Chinese plan to upgrade the airstrip would offer Beijing a foothold about 3,000km south-west of the US state of Hawaii. Kiribati said it would be a non-military project designed to bolster tourism. Papua New Guinea has had diplomatic ties with China since 1976, a year after becoming independent from Australia.It's the largest recipient of both Chinese and Australian aid.But some projects China has promised and not yet delivered.One is a $US4.1 billion ($5.7 billion) road project, which would upgrade 11 roads and connect all regions of the country.""If it eventuates, it would be the largest Chinese aid project in Pacific history,"" said the Lowy Institute's Alexandre Dayant.Another is the Ramu 2 hydropower plant, to which China has committed a potential $US920 million — if it goes ahead.""China's involvement in the Pacific through development support serves a double purpose,"" said Mr Dayant, who has mapped development funding flows in the Lowy Pacific Aid Map.""First, it answers a profound development need from the region … However, China's support isn't free and understanding its intent is important.""It is also important to mention that China isn't the only one using aid policies as leverage for favours. Australia's aid program, like New Zealand's and other western countries, often comes with strings attached.""Another aim of China's engagement in the region is to garner support on the world stage.Dr Newton Cain said investing in development needs meant China — and other donors — could build political capital when they wanted support at the United Nations, for example.In 2020, PNG backed China at the UN over its controversial national security law in Hong Kong.""It would be naive to think that China does this simply for altruistic purposes, just as it would be naive to think anybody else does it simply for altruistic purposes,"" she said.Graeme Smith, senior fellow at the ANU's Department of Pacific Affairs, said Solomon Islands was ""at the centre of this panic about Chinese bases"" now but a few years ago, that space was held by Vanuatu.Vanuatu's former ambassador to China, Sela Molisa, recently told the ABC's Pacific Beat program the 83-island nation desperately needed several development projects, including airports, roads and wharves.It was a wharf that raised eyebrows back in 2018.The $114 million Chinese-funded project is deep enough for cruise ships but also naval vessels to dock.Reports swirled that Beijing was seeking to build a permanent military base in the Pacific and was eyeing Vanuatu.Vanuatu's Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu strenuously denied it at the time.""No-one in the Vanuatu government has ever talked about a Chinese military base in Vanuatu of any sort,"" he said.""We are a non-aligned country. We are not interested in militarisation, we are just not interested in any sort of military base in our country.""Vanuatu government spokesperson Fred Vurobaravu reiterated there was no plan for a Chinese military base in Santo – which was a US naval base during World War II — ""and that position will remain unchanged"".He said it was one of the largest wharves in the South Pacific and Vanuatu was fortunate to have it.Dr Newton Cain said talk of a Chinese military base in the region was speculation.""There isn't actually any evidence of that yet. We haven't seen a military base being established anywhere in the Pacific,"" she said.""That may happen. It may happen in the next five years. It may happen in the next 10 years. It may never happen.""She said Pacific leaders had made it clear that what threatened their security was not China, but climate change, and they did not want to be caught up in other nations' geopolitical competition.""[Pacific leaders have said], 'We don't want to be used as pawns on a chessboard. We're not a prize to be fought over.'""Another project causing some anxiety was a proposed Chinese-backed port in Vaiusu Bay, Samoa.Samoa's Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa scrapped the $128 million project shortly after winning the 2021 election, saying there were ""more pressing projects"".She said the level of Samoa's indebtedness to China had been a concern for voters.As of last year, China was the largest lender to Samoa, which owed Beijing about 40 per cent of its total debt, around $200 million.A Reuters analysis in 2018 found China's lending to the Pacific went from nearly zero to $US1.3 billion in a decade, and that Chinese loans accounted for around half of the external debt burden in Vanuatu and Tonga.Vanuatu's government spokesperson told the ABC he could not disclose the current debt owed to China, but said some past loans had been forgiven.Mr Dayant said that China had not engaged in deliberate debt trap diplomacy yet and while indebtedness was a risk for Pacific economies, the reality was more nuanced.At the same time, the sheer size of Chinese lending meant that it was an intense share of smaller countries' GDPs, and he said that if China wanted to avoid accusations of debt entrapment, it should change its approach to be more sustainable.Pacific nations have ""risen to the complexity that is Chinese lending"", he added.""Less and less Chinese loans are signed by PICs [Pacific Island countries], mostly because they have limited fiscal space available after a pandemic that is still having a big impact on the region,"" he said.But another key area of Chinese support to Samoa — and to the Pacific more broadly — is health.Beijing said it had dispatched 600 medical staff to Pacific nations, provided 600,000 doses of vaccines and more than 100 tonnes of medical supplies.For Samoa, that includes around half a million US dollars in COVID assistance for masks and other PPE.But medical assistance also pre-dates the pandemic, with medical training in China and almost $US1 million in medical equipment for a Samoan hospital, including an X-ray machine, ultrasound machines and ear, nose and throat diagnostic equipment.One of the most significant projects China has funded in the Pacific is the rebuilding of the CBD in Nuku'alofa, Tonga's capital, following pro-democracy riots in 2006.Beijing provided a loan of more than $US100 million for the rebuild.In 2020, Reuters reported that almost two-thirds of Tonga's external debt of $US186 million was owed to China, according to budget statements.But China has also highlighted its aid and relief efforts in the Pacific following cyclones and natural disasters.One of the most shocking incidents was the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano — the biggest explosion since Krakatoa in 1883.It triggered a tsunami that damaged large swathes of Tonga and left much of the country covered in volcanic ash, and also severed an underwater communications cable.""The Chinese government was highly concerned and acted immediately, making China the first country in the world to provide assistance to Tonga,"" China's Foreign Ministry said.Tonga said China had donated $US1.3 million in cash and relief and restoration assistance since the eruption, while the Australian government said it delivered a total of 370 tonnes of emergency supplies and pledged a $16 million package for Tonga's long-term recovery.As Mr Dayant from the Lowy Institute points out, Pacific Island countries' vulnerability to national disasters makes it one of the most aid-dependent regions in the world and its location in a highly-contested ocean makes it a focus of strategic thinking. When Frank Bainimarama seized control of Fiji in a military coup in 2006, Western sanctions and a diplomatic deep freeze swiftly followed.But China threw a lifeline to Fiji — its pledged aid skyrocketed and its diplomatic ties deepened.Australia re-engaged after elections were held in 2014. Mr Bainimarama won and has since transformed into a leading voice on the climate crisis facing the Pacific.""Geopolitical point-scoring means less than little to anyone whose community is slipping beneath the rising seas,"" he said in a press conference last week after it became clear a consensus had not been reached on the sweeping China-proposed agreement.While China — the most populous country — is the world's biggest polluter, some of its involvement in the Pacific has focused on climate change.Earlier this year, Beijing unveiled the China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Action Cooperation Centre.China also provided funds to Fiji in response to a series of cyclones, as well as $US1.4 million to build a sea wall to protect against rising ocean levels.""Now, they are well established in the Pacific. Chinese aid has done its job,"" Mr Dayant said.He said Chinese aid also provided a vehicle to implement state-owned enterprises in the region.Dr Newton Cain added that the state-owned enterprises had ""evolved and modified"" to become part of the business community in some countries.That included bidding for local contracts, workers living in the country and sending their children to school there, and supporting local football teams.""They are becoming part of the environment in which they work,"" she said.Some Fijians told the Associated Press they saw a benefit to Chinese foreign investment in the country, as long as it uplifted people.One of them, Georgina Matilda, said working for Chinese infrastructure company China Railway meant she could put food on the table for her children.Dr Newton Cain said there was a move away from donors flying in their own workers solely, as countries were increasingly concerned about whether infrastructure projects would lead to local jobs.""These big Chinese companies are recognising that is something that people are watching,"" she said.""In small economies, a couple of big road-building projects … you would expect there to be significant spillover effects, so that … it is actually injecting some cash into the local economy.""Niue's Premier and Foreign Minister Dalton Tagelagi met with Mr Wang via a video call last month, and the Chinese government said both sides pledged to ""deepen bilateral cooperation including on the Belt and Road Initiative"". It said the two countries had signed documents that would boost cooperation on infrastructure and broadcasting as well as ""expand the blue economy and the biopharmaceutical corporation"" — but what this looked like in reality was unclear.Niue is a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand and has had diplomatic relations with China since 2007 — its second-largest trade partner.Niue has a population of approximately 1,600 and a landmass of just 261 square kilometres but lays claim to an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Pacific Ocean that's about the size of Vietnam.While little is known about the ins and outs of agreements between Niue and China, Dr Smith said China's efforts were likely aimed at keeping Niue onside.""To some extent … it's just about Taiwan,"" he said.""Territorial integrity is still the main driver of their strategy in the region ... reducing Taiwan's diplomatic spaces there has always been right up there.""So you paid the minimum to keep them in your camp.""Cook Islands is reported to have a number of projects with China assisting the island nation in a range of areas including public services, education and the fishing industry.Among them are public works including the refurbishments of a Chinese-constructed Ministry of Justice building, a police headquarters and a sports arena, which Denghua Zhang, a research fellow at ANU's College of Asia and the Pacific, said were similar to China's projects around the region. All three were built with Chinese loans between 2004 and 2009, but fell into disrepair and were built with materials ""inappropriate for the Cook Islands tropical environment"", according to the Lowy Institute. China has agreed to fund the repairs.There's also the China-New Zealand-Cook Islands water supply project (Te Mato Vai) to upgrade the supply network on the main island of Rarotonga that launched in 2014.As Dr Zhang wrote in a 2015 paper, the project — led by a Chinese company and estimated to cost about $NZ60 million ($54 million)— was to be partly funded by a grant from New Zealand and a concessional loan from China.The ""triangular"" aid project also meant New Zealand could learn about China's aid delivery and ensure the concessional loan from China was well managed, the paper said.But after the completion of stage one in 2017, a leak was detected and an independent review found that 17 kilometres of pipeline needed replacing. Stage two of the project is being completed by construction company McConnell Dowell, a subsidiary of a company called Aveng which has its headquarters in South Africa. Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is one of two countries in the North Pacific to recognise China, with Palau, Nauru and Marshall Islands still diplomatically tied to Taiwan.It was David Panuelo, President of FSM, who wrote to other Pacific leaders warning that China's proposed deal was ""a smokescreen for a larger agenda"".""Despite our ceaseless and accurate howls that climate change represents the single most existential security threat to our islands, the Common Development Vision threatens to bring a new Cold War era at best, and a world war at worst,"" he wrote.FSM is in a compact of free association with the US. That gives the US control over airspace and waters in exchange for the US providing funding, defence and access to US social services for Micronesians.At the same time, FSM has been a beneficiary of Chinese money, with more than $US100 million funnelled into the country over 30 years.The Lowy Pacific Aid Map shows China has committed $US5 million per year from 2017 to 2025, as well as a $US2 million cash grant to the country's trust fund.Dr Zhang has noted that FSM has a policy of not taking loans, helping it to avoid debt risk.China has also funded roads, bridges and a state government complex in the country. ""What we do in the island country is to build roads and bridges, not to increase military presence,"" Mr Wang told his FSM counterpart last week.","Asia, China, Cook Islands, Defence and National Security, Disaster Relief, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, International Aid and Trade, Kiribati, Micronesia, Federated States Of, Niue, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2022-06-07T18:37:01+00:00

61,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-01/china-foreign-minister-pacific-visit-analysis/101116656,"Henry Puna has had a torrid time of it recently. Last year, the former Cook Islands Prime Minister won a tightly contested and acrimonious ballot to take on the leadership of the Pacific's top regional body, the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), and promptly found himself in the middle of a political hurricane.PIF split apart almost immediately, leading to laborious and often painful negotiations as Pacific officials — with assistance from Australia and New Zealand — try to salve wounded egos and hammer out a compromise that will keep Micronesian countries in the big tent.The secretary-general's fate is likely to be finally resolved — one way or another — at the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting, which is loosely pegged to be held in the middle of next month, in Suva.Micronesian leaders have already publicly declared they expect him to walk away from the job and hand it over to one of their candidates, which leaves Puna publicly humiliated and exposed.But if Puna is a dead man walking, he did not look like that this week.In fact, he looked very much like a man with something urgent to say.The stage was a big one. Late on Saturday, all eyes swivelled to Suva as China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi landed in Fiji's capital, his fourth stop on an island-hopping tour covering no fewer than eight Pacific Island countries.His trip came the same week as new Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong touched down in Fiji and pledged to listen to Pacific leaders. She revealed she would be heading back to the Pacific on Wednesday night, meeting with leaders in Samoa and Tonga ""to renew and strengthen Australia's deep ties of friendship and family"" and to discuss what further help Australia can offer to Tonga after a disastrous underwater volcanic explosion earlier this year.Wang's first publicly advertised engagement was with Mr Puna at the PIF Secretariat the next day.The visit had a somewhat perfunctory air. China is a Dialogue Partner with PIF, but the brute reality is that Beijing is impatient to bypass the regional organisation, and has moved quickly to set up its own direct dialogue with all Pacific Island countries it has ties with.China talks a lot about consensus, but has done very little to seek it.Right now, its diplomats are in a hurry, with no time for navigating the careful (sometimes torturous) processes of negotiation and consensus building at the core of PIF.So it was hard to escape the feeling that Wang's Sunday PIF stop off was a bit of a courtesy call, a polite nod to Pacific regionalism before the Foreign Minister got down to the real business of meeting with Fiji's Prime Minister and regional heavyweight Frank Bainimarama, as well as playing host and impresario for the second China-Pacific Island Countries Foreign Ministers' Meeting.The Chinese officials shepherding Wang through the Secretariat certainly weren't treading carefully.When they saw the ABC's cameraman positioned to film the greeting, they objected loudly and angrily, arguing the visit was limited to Chinese and Fijian media only.One minder even placed herself directly in front of the ABC's camera.PIF's impressive media representative, Lisa Williams-Lahari, (not a woman who is easily intimidated) had to rather forcefully remind them that they were visitors rather than hosts, and that PIF — not China — was setting the rules for media.Fijian journalists also backed in the ABC in an impressive display of solidarity.But the tension among Chinese government minders didn't dissipate after the Foreign Minister arrived.When Wang sat down in one of the secretariat's beautiful timber meeting rooms, he nodded politely to Puna, smiled briefly at the gathered cameras and paused, seemingly waiting for them to depart the room.But before they left, Puna had something he wanted to say.Instead of delivering pleasantries, the PIF secretary-general laid out three ""key issues"" that would be at the core of their discussions.""Firstly, urgent and ambitious climate change action,"" he said, with cameras rolling.""Our forum leaders have identified climate change as the single greatest threat facing our Blue Pacific region.""Action to keep our world below 1.5 degrees is vital for the future prosperity and wellbeing of our region.""This is a message Puna has delivered time and time again to all major countries and big polluters, including Australia. It is not one reserved for China alone.But putting it directly to the Foreign Minister of the world's largest carbon emitter in front of a live television feed was still a pointed bit of political messaging.Chinese officials — perhaps expecting nothing more than an anodyne welcome statement and bland formalities — were clearly not happy.The ABC filmed some of them gesticulating and complaining to PIF staff after media left the room.It wasn't the only time in Suva that things didn't go perfectly to plan for Wang and the Chinese foreign affairs officials following in his wake.Much has already been written about China shelving — for now — its contentious ""Common Development Vision"" regional agreement.The draft text was leaked less than a week before Wang's meeting with foreign ministers, presumably by someone intent on spiking it.Chinese officials had clearly been instructed to try and get the sweeping pact over the line ahead of Wang's flagship meeting with Pacific foreign ministers, handing Beijing an emphatic (and very public) diplomatic victory while potentially reshaping the region's strategic contours.They poured considerable time and energy into rushing it through.But this is not how Pacific diplomacy usually works.You catch brief glimpses of the diplomatic strain this caused in the carefully weighed statements from some Pacific Island leaders.Samoa's Prime Minister Fiamē Naomi Mata'afa said rather pointedly that, ""We have not made a decision [on the pact] as we did not have enough time to look at it.""In other words: This is important. We are not beholden to your timetable. Don't rush us.Australia and the United States will hardly be celebrating — Beijing has signalled it will press ahead with negotiations and it seems determined to land the agreement in one shape or another.But they still see clear signs of over-reach from China.One Western official told the ABC that quite a few Pacific Island nations had reservations about the pact and that several foreign ministers in the gathering didn't want it on the meeting agenda at all.""When it was leaked, it was dead. It was probably dead before that,"" they told the ABC.Prime Minister Fiamē has even suggested that the Pacific Island Forum may be best body to discuss China's proposal, in the spirit of Pacific unity.China will resist that at all costs.Among PIF's members are four Pacific nations that recognise Taiwan rather than Beijing.Australia and New Zealand are also PIF members, and it's safe to assume they'd throw all their energies into sinking the pact.That explains why some analysts are predicting that if the whole debate lands in PIF's lap it will inevitably become the agreement's graveyard.But for now, this is speculation.We don't know if other Pacific Island countries would be happy to handball this particular hot potato to PIF.We don't even yet have a clear idea of what they said to Wang Yi about the pact when they sat down with him on Monday.In fact, the only public statement from a Pacific Islands representative who attended the meeting has come from the office of — you guessed it — Henry Puna.And once again, it makes for interesting reading.The secretary-general made a rather jaundiced reference to the ""increasing intensity, of geopolitical manoeuvring in our region today"" and the ""recent influx of high-level visits to our Blue Pacific"". ""Many of these partnerships are not new,"" the transcript reads, ""but have been re-invigorated in recent years, often in direct response to geo-political positioning.""That's aimed as much at the United States — which is hurriedly reopening its embassy in Solomon Islands as Beijing forges new security links with Honiara — as it is at China.But Puna also seized the chance to remind Beijing that sidestepping his organisation — while racing to build new commercial and security connections throughout the Blue Pacific — risks opening new fault-lines in a region already grappling with mounting challenges.""Being a Forum Dialogue Partner is not without its own expectations and responsibilities,"" the transcript reads.""The chief among which, is to nurture a relationship that is respectful of our shared values, built on joint collaboration and partnership, works with and through our regional mechanisms and progresses mutually agreed priorities.""And the intensifying contest for power and influence in the Pacific means that countries — ""including China"" have to place ""increasing value [on] our collective ability to think, live, engage and deliver, as one Blue Pacific region"". Yes, it's carefully worded. But the message is unmistakable.Henry Puna may, or may not, be heading for the door soon. But either way, he's not quite done yet.  ","China, Fiji, International Aid and Trade, Kiribati, National Security, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2022-06-01T06:08:23+00:00
62,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-05/cruise-ships-pacific-tourism-pollution-environment/101080764,"Before the pandemic, cruise ships took tourists to some of the most beautiful destinations in the world in ever-increasing numbers.In 2019, nearly 30 million passengers stepped aboard a cruise ship, almost double the passenger numbers of a decade earlier, according to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA).With the largest cruise ship ever built — a floating city housing more than 9,000 guests and crew — currently cruising the Mediterranean, and Australia lifting its COVID-19-induced cruise ship ban, the industry is confident of a quick recovery.But behind the dreamy photos and blue horizons lies a less glamorous reality — a growing concern about environmental violations, carbon emissions and the benefits to local economies.In Vanuatu, one of the largest cruise markets in the South Pacific, a date is yet to be set for the return of international cruises.When they do return, Tourism Vanuatu wants to see some changes to how international cruise lines operate.""We would want to see the increase in sales of Vanuatu-made products on the ship … and inclusion of traditional food experiences as part of any tours on offer once cruises return to Vanuatu,"" Adela Issachar, CEO of the Vanuatu Tourism Office, said.Ms Issachar said she was excited to see international cruises return to Vanuatu, adding they were an important part of the country's tourism market.She said Tourism Vanuatu was in discussions with the major cruise lines Carnival Corporation — the owner of P&O Cruises — and Royal Caribbean.John Connell, professor of human geography at the University of Sydney, said generally cruise ships were ""designed to trap the money on board"".However, he said the average spend of tourists who disembarked in Vanuatu and Fiji, the next largest cruise market among Pacific nations, was still significant to these countries' economies.Professor Connell said now was a good time for countries in the Pacific to establish a ""new normal"" for the industry for both economic and environmental reasons.""The regulations are only beginning to emerge as the cruise ship industry hasn't been going all that long in the Pacific,"" he said.Johanna Loehr from the Griffith Institute for Tourism said cruise ships were particularly ""energy intense"".""The cruise sector is only part of the emissions associated with tourism and transport, [but] cruise ship passengers have a considerably large carbon footprint,"" Ms Loehr said.""[Cruise ships are] obviously larger than hotels, and they have to float, and they have to move, and that is just really energy intense.""In 2018 the CLIA, along with the major cruise companies, committed to reducing emissions by 40 per cent – compared to 2008 levels — by 2030 and reaching net-zero by 2050.According to the CLIA, emission reductions will be achieved through initiatives such as connecting ships to local power grids in ports, switching future vessels to liquefied natural gas (LNG), and installing exhaust gas cleaning systems.""Cruise lines are investing many billions of dollars in ships that offer greater efficiency and achieve significant emission reductions,"" Joel Katz, managing director of CLIA Australasia, said. ""We're also seeing investment and joint ventures in future alternative fuels and power sources like biofuel, methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, and electric batteries.""Mr Katz added the NSW government had recently announced a partnership with cruise lines and other maritime organisations to introduce shore power facilities at Sydney's White Bay Cruise Terminal, powered by renewable electricity.A spokesperson for Carnival Corporation said while none of its three P&O vessels travelling Australia and the South Pacific could use LNG fuel, they could use shore power when docked.However, there were no ports in the region currently equipped to provide this service, they said.Dr Loehr said LNG should only be seen as ""a stepping stone to more environmentally friendly and more efficient fuels"".""Also, when we talk about targets … we need the sector to achieve a net reduction,"" she said.""They're really not focused on net reduction, but on the reductions that are achieved on a per passenger or per kilometre base … that then still allows for the total footprint of the sector to grow.""But carbon is not the only consideration when looking at the environmental impact of cruise ships.Marcie Keever, director of Friends of the Earth's ocean and vessels project, has been watching the cruise industry in the United States since its rapid growth in the early 2000s.""We saw all of these cruise companies getting cited by the federal government for pollution,"" Ms Keever said.""They would pay their fines, and then once they're off federal probation, the violations would start again, the most recent example of that is Carnival

previous environmental crimes.""The corporate defendant here ignored the court, choosing instead to thwart the compliance plan that was put in place to protect our environment,"" US attorney for the Southern District of Florida Juan Antonio Gonzalez said in a statement.In 2017, Princess Cruises was fined $US40 million ($55.6 million) after pleading guilty to charges stemming from its deliberate dumping of oil-contaminated waste from one of its vessels and intentional acts to cover it up.Two years later, the company was convicted of six probation violations and fined an additional $US20 million.Ms Keever said she wanted to see increased monitoring of the industry and stronger regulations established in the US and internationally to protect marine environments and residents near ports from pollution.A Carnival Corporation spokesperson did not respond directly to the ABC's question about the legacy of violations in the US but did say the company was building on its history of strong achievements in decarbonisation.""Our carbon footprint [peaked] more than a decade ago, we have delivered a significant reduction in carbon intensity through 2019,"" the spokesperson said.""[We] have also made great strides in our circular economy focus area through food waste and single-use plastic reductions, which are now tracking well ahead of our goals.""The ABC also approached Royal Caribbean Cruises for comment on its progress to reduce carbon emissions and its environmental footprint.A spokesperson for the organisation said its efforts were outlined in its 'Seastainability'

Tourism, said.Ms Tari said strengthening the legislation around maritime environmental protection and cruise ship capacity would benefit the industry in the long term.She said the current focus was on

It's so heartless.""Willie* came to Australia under the Seasonal Worker Program (SWP) in January last year to make money and support his five children in Vanuatu.He said hundreds of dollars were deducted from his pay each week for expenses, including accommodation and transport to work on farms. ""Sometimes, you only end up with $200. How can you survive with that,"" he said.""When I send the money home, I haven't got none.""Despite a national labour shortage in the horticulture industry, some workers said they were only working half a day, and their income was not covering their expenses.Mr Levitt said he had received a report of one Bundaberg employer issuing fines of $500 for drinking alcohol outside of work hours.""They're threatened with fines if they consume alcohol. They're banned from having any sexual relationships with people,"" he said.""These people are adults, some are 30 or 40 years old, and their lives are basically treated as if they are slaves in our land."" The workers complained about their living conditions at backpacker hostels, where they said kitchen and cooking facilities were broken and they had to deal with outbreaks of bed bugs.""During the night, I can't sleep because of the bed bugs,"" Willie said.""We expected to live in separate rooms, but we came, and we had to share rooms,"" said another Vanuatu worker named Alice*.""It's like three people in one room, and then we're paying more than we expected.""The ABC contacted the hostels, who said they undertook monthly pest control, and the accommodation was approved by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment under the former Seasonal Worker Program. The Pacific and Seasonal Worker Programs have now been rolled into the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) Scheme.A spokesperson from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said hostel accommodation previously approved under the SWP would not be re-approved following the program's integration into the PALM scheme. ""Accommodation standards are currently being considered as part of stakeholder consultation for the new PALM scheme Deed and Guidelines,"" they said.The spokesperson said any worker with concerns about their workplace, accommodation or safety is strongly encouraged to contact a 24/7 worker welfare hotline on 1800 51 51 31.Pastoral carer Geoffrey Smith is expected to raise concerns about the scheme during a Senate hearing this week.""I'm suggesting blackbirding has never finished and I'm also suggesting slavery hasn't finished either,"" he said.The workers have called for reforms, including additional support on farms to help them better understand their work agreements.""We're really doing our best, and then we're friendly, we're open.

That's what drove the government's decision making,"" he told the ABC.After months of discussion and false starts, the final deal seems to have come together quickly.Documents from inside Treasury, obtained using the Freedom of Information (FOI) process, show a one-day process as approval was sought from different ministers involved.The morning after the deal was back ""on"", Ms Rogers updated Luke Yeaman, deputy secretary of the macroeconomic group, and Vicki Wilkinson, first assistant secretary of the international economic and security division.Three other Treasury officials were on the communication, but their names were redacted in documents received by the ABC.The email appears to reference the Finance Minister, Trade, Tourism and Investment Minister's Office, the Treasurer's Office and a 'minsub' – a ministerial submission, but Treasury has not confirmed if this is accurate.""The letter has been signed by the FM and is currently with the TTIMO. We are told it should arrive in the TO later today. We'll send up a new minsub in the next couple of hours. We haven't changed the letter, but the submission will outline the changes that led to the delay,"" Ms Rogers emailed.Through the afternoon, emails suggest the signed contract moved from the Treasurer's office to the Trade Minister's. An unsigned copy was circulated on email and by a form of communication redacted in the documents. The signed copy was handled in person.""It will be walked from office to office,"" Ms Rogers added.By 3:00pm it was done.""We have updated the ministerial submission to reflect last minute changes to the transaction,"" Ms Rogers wrote.""We understand that the letter will be walked around once signed from the Trade Minister's office. I understand that they have been in contact.""While the emails describe last-minute changes, a search for Treasury analysis of the changing deal came up empty.A search for Treasury reports noting Digicel in the fortnight before the transaction – and the day after it was announced – was refused because Treasury ""holds no documents with the scope of your request"".""I arranged for officers in my division to search Treasury records for material relevant to your request. These searches included searches of emails and Treasury's file management system. I am satisfied that no such documents exist,"" Jim Hagan, chief adviser of the international economics and security division of Treasury wrote in refusing the request.This does not suggest that no analysis was done by Treasury, just that it was not captured in the FOI application.It also does not capture analysis that may have been conducted by other departments or agencies.One document was not released because it went before Cabinet and is exempt from FOI.

So I [made] my decision to run away to go to the different employer,"" Mike said.But when he got there he was paid in cash, earning as little as $300 for six days' work, and sharing a room with five others in a house with no lighting.""When I got there and when I realised that everything is not true, I was very regret[ful],"" he said.Mike once again turned to the union and was able to reconnect with the Seasonal Worker Program.He has since returned to Vanuatu, and hopes to come back to Australia for next year's harvest, but said it was important for workers to know their rights.Figures show the number of seasonal workers who ran away from their employer jumped from 225 to 1,181 in the past year, prompting the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) to release a poster warning workers who abscond: ""You may bring shame to your family's reputation"".Following a backlash, DFAT is reviewing the posters, which are no longer available to download from their website.An Australian government spokesperson said there was a ""zero tolerance"" approach to worker exploitation, and workers are briefed before departure and on arrival in Australia to ensure they understand their visa entitlements.Human rights lawyers say the high rate of absconding is a consequence of widespread exploitation and wage theft within the Seasonal Worker Program, with a class action being prepared.But migration law expert Joanna Howe said within the hierarchy of migrant farm workers, those under the Seasonal Worker Program fare comparatively well.""There really are some horrible examples of abuse in that program – unlawful deductions, exorbitant prices for accommodation, wage theft – but the reason we find out is because that's a regulated program,"" she said.""The irony is that [the Seasonal Worker Program] is the best regulated out of all the various programs we have to bring temporary migrants onto farms in Australia.""There are other groups of temporary migrants who are far more vulnerable.""One such cohort is those working on farms without valid visas, commonly known as undocumented workers.Studies show there are between 60,000 to 100,000 undocumented workers on Australian farms.""I think most Australians would be surprised to find out that each one of us has eaten fruit and vegetables picked or packed by an undocumented migrant,"" Ms Howe said.She said most undocumented workers have paid a hefty fee to a ""dodgy"" migration agent to organise their visa and what they're promised will be a well-paying job – only to arrive and discover they're on a tourist visa with no right to work.They will then typically meet an unscrupulous labour hire contractor who takes them to the regions, where they are forced to work on farms to repay their debt.""The farmer deals with the contractor. The contractor gets a lump sum,"" Ms Howe said.""The farmer might even think that he or she is paying the right amount for that group of workers, but the contractor takes a lot and the workers get very little.""Undocumented migrants are the dark underbelly of this industry.""Unless we address the presence of undocumented workers on farms, we will not be able to address the issue of substantial wage theft and exploitation of all migrant farm workers in Australia.""Several undocumented workers spoke on the condition of anonymity.One man from Malaysia said he was told he could earn more than $300 a day picking fruit in Australia.But when he arrived five years ago, he was only earning around $30 a day doing back-breaking work.""The first week, I wanted to cry,"" he said.At one farm, he paid $40 a week to live in a shipping container with eight others.A young woman brought hand-written payslips from a labour hire contractor showing she was paid just $28.50 for a day's work plucking leaves from grapevines.The workers have no access to Medicare or health insurance, and most are afraid to go to the hospital if they're unwell or injured.A woman who lives in the Sunraysia region, Esita, said some of her friends had lived in Australia without valid visas for more than 20 years, during which time many had married and had children.She said undocumented workers were routinely bullied and verbally abused, while many women were sexually harassed and inappropriately touched while climbing ladders to pick fruit.""They can't answer back because they're so scared,"" she said.""I have so many friends that have been trapped in this situation and they really need help.""Another local woman, Dewi, said some of her friends who are undocumented workers feared deportation if they spoke out.""They still choose to work in the same farm, the same place, because they feel like they have nowhere to go,"" she said.And it's not just the workers who are suffering.At Ian McAlister's stone fruit orchard near Swan Hill, the smell of rotting fruit hangs in the air.The grower typically needs 60 workers for the peak harvest. Instead, he has 16.Pickers are frantically working to harvest trees bursting with ripe apricots, peaches and nectarines.But it's impossible to pick all the fruit on the sprawling orchard, so Mr McAlister has no choice but to watch 350 tonnes of fresh peaches – about 7,000 trees' worth – drop to the ground.""It's an unmitigated disaster this year,"" he said.""In the past two years, I've pulled out nearly 200 acres without replanting, and if it keeps going like it currently today, the rest of it will go within the next couple of months.""Four years ago, Mr McAlister decided not to work with contractors who employed undocumented workers.Without them, and without the usual stream of backpackers, he's barely staying afloat.""We're doing the right thing and we're getting absolutely caned,"" he said.United Worker Union national secretary Tim Kennedy said undocumented workers had been propping up the horticulture industry for years.""Unless these workers participate in the industry, we don't have a horticultural industry,"" he said.The federal government's National Agricultural Workforce Strategy outlines two ways to shore up the farm labour market: introduce a national licensing program to crack down on unscrupulous labour hire contractors, and issue a one-off amnesty – or status resolution – to grant visas to undocumented workers.Mr McAlister said granting working rights to undocumented migrants would allow him to employ the workers directly, rather than dealing with exploitative labour hire contractors.The proposal for an amnesty has won the backing of Nationals MP Anne Webster, whose electorate of Mallee encompasses Robinvale and Swan Hill.""Harvest wouldn't take place without some of these people,"" Ms Webster said.""I think that we should have a compassionate response, an understanding resolution and a pathway to permanent residency should be on the table.""But a spokesperson from the Department of Home Affairs said the government does not support an amnesty, which would ""likely create a perverse incentive for people to gain illegal entry into Australia, effectively on false pretences, overstay their visa and go to ground until the government of the day announces a new amnesty"".""This would also send the wrong message to employers, who are breaking the law when they employ unlawful non-citizens,"" they said.The last time Australia offered a mass amnesty for undocumented migrants was in 1980.The spokesperson said the Australian Border Force has dedicated officers to combat foreign worker exploitation, and the government is working with states and territories to implement a national approach to labour hire regulation.The federal government has also proposed new laws which, if passed, would introduce criminal offences for using a person's migration status to exploit them in the workplace.There are also plans to stem labour shortages on farms by rolling out a new agriculture visa for workers from south-east Asia, which will include a pathway to permanent residency.As one worker said: ""We pick your food.

Hilda Wayne finds out. She said the fundamental problems with Western notions of beauty was that they only valued a woman's physical characteristics, and ""othered"" Pacific Island women.""If [a woman's] physical appearance appeals to the majority, then it's considered the closest illustration of beauty,"" she said.Ms Latu drew upon the concept of Orientalism by Edward Said, which created an image of Eastern cultures as uncivilised, compared to the West. ""It looks at understanding the West as the hegemony. And then anything outside that is the other,"" she said.""The term 'exotic' was used to describe the tropical settings like our Pacific Islands, so images of Pasifika women became a manifestation of pleasure for the white male gaze.""There was a strong suggestion that Pacific women were seen as both sensual and savage, which is considered 'other' to the West.""Ms Latu said Pasifika women historically were seen as ""exotic"" and ""different"", which led to a ""double marginalisation"" in daily life. ""There were such depictions where women were photographed partly naked in the forest with flowers in the hair,"" she said.""This depiction of beauty was not only introduced to the Western ideology of beauty, but also captured the double marginalisation of Pasifika women.One participant in Ms Latu's research paper confessed she still received comments from people about her ""exotic"" appearance.""She was a Fijian with European and other nationalities. She talked about how she's often labelled as being 'exotic-looking' – a reference that she understood to hold significant value to the Eurocentric ideology of Western beauty,"" she said.When it came to fitting in, Ms Latu said all participants in her study agreed on one point.""If they could look like the ultimate standard of beauty, then, to them, they would be rewarded by the social capital of acceptance.""Ni-Vanuatu woman Ruth Kaltonga grew up surrounded by Western notions of beauty —""white women with soft long hair"" — in magazines or on television.As a young girl, it affected her.""All these types of women were being defined as beautiful, that this is what beauty is like and then you see that none of them look like you,"" she said.""It does create some sort of doubt.""When travelling to Vanuatu's outer islands, Ms Kaltonga said women seemed relatively unfazed by the beauty standards being peddled online — a phenomenon she wished she saw in the city.""When you go to really rural areas, these things don't matter to them. But, in the capital, the beauty standard has really taken its toll and [is] causing a lot of issues with identity and self-worth,"" she said.""It's not about what you look like or how long your hair is. It's about what you can do for your family, how you care for your family and how you contribute.""Ms Kaltonga said having strong, grounded female role models helped overcome critical thoughts. ""I was very fortunate. The women in my family and the members of my family really taught us that it's what's inside that counts.""Ms Latu agreed, and said Pacific Island families played an important role in uplifting women and building a healthy self-esteem — a theme she explored in her research.""Just having words of encouragement from mothers can really make you feel better,"" she said.""It starts from home. When you have a supportive family and community, it really does make life a lot easier, especially when we're bombarded with what we're seeing online.""Fotuosamoa Jody Jackson is a Samoan storyteller and educator, who now calls New Zealand home.Speaking from a personal perspective, Fotuosamoa said beauty in a Pacific Island context was about service to others and knowing where you come from.After the death of her father early on in her life, Fotuosamoa and her seven siblings were raised by a strong, single mother who disregarded aesthetic beauty.""It's the person, who you are, and your identity before anything to do with your physical attributes"" she said.""But there were things that define beauty in my culture, which is when you know who you are, when you speak your language, when you know what to do in a in a cultural setting.""No one teaches you anything. You just have to look and listen and learn. And when you achieve all those things, there is the belief that that is beautiful.""Despite the criticism, Fotuosamoa said she felt encouraged by young women who embraced their individuality online, rather than being swayed by Western trends.This was particularly the case with her 14-year-old daughter.""What I have loved about social media is that it's really allowed the younger crowd to make decisions for themselves,"" she said.""They are much better people than us because they are learning through social media and they are making decisions, especially on Instagram.""Fotuosamoa said introducing some control over her daughter's account and having regular conversations about content she read was a positive experience overall.""I have to continually demonstrate to my children that being Pasifika and being Samoan is a beautiful thing.

One is in cabinet, one is not. You calibrate your diplomacy to deal with sensitive issues,"" he said. ""In the Pacific, one of the things you [have] got to be very, very cognisant of is there is a long history of frankly countries like Australia and even New Zealand and others coming around and treating Pacific Islands like they should be doing what the big countries tell them to do.""I'm not going to act like former administrations that treated the Pacific like some extension of Australia. The Pacific Islands are very sensitive to that and I have always had an approach with the Pacific Islands which understands those sensitivities because there is a lot at stake.""The Prime Minister also said the whole region had been facing ""intense"" approaches from China, saying Beijing made ""all sorts of promises"" and ""all sorts of investments"" in the Pacific which could be ""very persuasive"". ""That is the challenge that we're now dealing with and we have been dealing with it for many years. It is not a new issue and these threats still remain"" he said.""I speak to other Pacific leaders about it all the time and ... you can't always be fully persuasive on these issues.""What I assure them about is that Australia will be there for you as we always are, not because we want anything from you, but because we see the Pacific as our family.""Australia, New Zealand and the United States have all expressed concern about the precedent the situation could set for other small Pacific nations.Australia's spy chiefs were also sent to Honiara to ventilate Australia's concerns about the pact.Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare took to the floor of parliament this morning to defend the pact, declaring that his government went into the agreement with its ""eyes wide open"". Mr Sogavare also suggested the agreement would help bolster the police force in Solomon Islands, which has already received riot gear and replica guns from Chinese police. ""We intend to beef up and strengthen our police capability to deal with any future instability by properly equipping the police to take full responsibility of the country's security responsibilities, in the hope we will never be required to invoke any of our bilateral security arrangements,"" he said. When asked if he'd be willing to release the full text of the agreement he gave an ambiguous response, saying it was the ""way to go"" but also saying he had to consult with China before making a decision.Beijing typically does not release the text of its bilateral security agreements with other countries. In a statement, Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the US National Security Council, said the US convened a meeting with senior officials from Australia, Japan and New Zealand.""The officials reaffirmed the four countries' enduring and shared commitment to the Pacific Islands,"" she said.""The United States resolved to intensify its engagement in the region to meet 21st-century challenges.""Officials from the four countries represented also shared concerns about a proposed security framework between the Solomon Islands and the People's Republic of China and its serious risks to a free and open Indo-Pacific.""Foreign Minister Marise Payne rejected Senator Wong's assessment that inaction by the Morrison government had fuelled the situation.""I think that's an unfair characterisation, and I don't think it recognises the sovereign decisions that governments, of course, make for themselves,"" she said.""We are looking at very serious geo-strategic challenges in our region, and they are realities.""Senator Payne insisted that Australia still played a significant role in the South Pacific.""We firmly believe that the Pacific family is best placed to meet the security needs of our region — and we've consistently said that and, more importantly, we've consistently demonstrated that,"" Senator Payne said.However, she argued, the governments in Honiara and Beijing needed to provide more detail about exactly what the security deal would allow for.""In relation to this agreement, we see a lack of transparency"" she said.""This has not been agreed in an open and transparent way, not been consulted, for example, across the region.""Top US official Kurt Campbell is slated to visit Solomon Islands later this week, as the United States warned of the ""concerning precedent"" the security deal set.Senator Payne said she was pleased the trip was going ahead, but avoided speculation about whether the deal could be undone.""That's a matter for the parties,"" she said.","Australia, China, Defence and National Security, Federal Government, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, New Zealand, Samoa, Security Intelligence, Solomon Islands, Tonga, United States, Vanuatu, ",2022-04-19T22:14:13+00:00

after the eruption of the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha'apai volcano, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.Around 2 centimetres of volcanic ash and dust has fallen on Tongatapu —Tonga's main island— since Saturday's eruption, which triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific Ocean.Ash in the air and on the ground has raised concerns about air pollution and the potential contamination of food and water supplies, the WHO said.Locals have been advised to drink bottled water and wear masks outdoors to avoid breathing in the ash.""Thankfully, all health facilities on Tongatapu are fully functioning and clean-up efforts have been initiated,"" the WHO said.It said initial reports were that around 100 houses had been damaged and 50 completely destroyed on Tongatapu. ""Many [Tongans] remain displaced, with 89 people taking shelter in evacuation centres on the island of 'Eua and many more seeking shelter with relatives,"" the WHO said. ""The Ha'apai and Vava'u island groups … remain out of contact with the capital [Nuku'alofa].""There were particular concerns about the smaller and low-lying islands of Mango and Fonoi in the Ha'apai group, the WHO said.Scientists have warned that volcanic ash could deliver long-lasting damage to coral reefs, erode coastlines and disrupt fisheries.The scientists have been studying satellite images and looking to the past to predict the future of the remote region.Since the initial eruption, the volcano has been releasing sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide — two gases that create acid rain when they interact with water and oxygen in the atmosphere.With Tonga's tropical climate, ""there is likely to be acid rain around Tonga for a while to come"", according to volcanologist Shane Cronin from the University of Auckland.Acid rain causes widespread crop damage, and could ruin Tongan staples such as taro, corn, bananas and garden vegetables.""Depending on how long the eruptions last, food security could be compromised,"" Professor Cronin said.Satellite imagery shows the plume from the volcano spreading westward, which means Tonga could be spared some of this acid rain, although Fiji could then be in its path.In a bulletin on Monday, the UN humanitarian affairs office said Fiji was monitoring its air quality, and had advised people to cover their household water tanks and stay indoors in the event of rain.Tonga's exclusive economic zone of nearly 700,000 marine square kilometres is 1,000 times larger than its land area.And most Tongans get their food — and livelihood — from the ocean.While scientists have yet to investigate on the ground, ""the few pictures that are available seem to show a blanket … of ash"" on land, according to Marco Brenna, a geologist from the University of Otago in New Zealand.In the ocean, that ash can be harmful to marine life.Weeks before Saturday's eruption, Tonga Geological Services had warned that nearby seawater was contaminated with toxic volcanic discharge, and that fishermen should ""assume fish in these waters are poisoned or poisonous"".Inevitably, the weekend's huge eruption has made the situation worse.Murky, ash-filled water near the volcano will deprive fish of food and wipe out spawning beds.Some fish will perish, and survivors will be forced to migrate, scientists said.Further, changes in the structure of the sea floor could create new obstacles for fishing vessels.""It will be a while before the same or new fishing grounds will be restored,"" Dr Brenna said.Falling ash can also smother coral reefs that, in Tonga, are the mainstay of a tourism industry that brought in up to $5 million per year before the COVID-19 pandemic.Even before the eruption, Tonga's reefs were threatened by disease outbreaks and the effects of climate change, including coral bleaching and increasingly strong cyclones.Now, ""vast areas of the reefs in the immediate impact area at Hunga Tonga are probably buried and smothered by large deposits of volcanic ash"", according to Tom Schils, a marine biologist from the University of Guam who has studied volcanic eruptions and corals in the Northern Mariana Islands.Such eruptions also release more iron into the water, which can boost the growth of blue-green algae and sponges, which further degrade reefs.Reefs may have to start over — a process that could take years, according to Brian Zgliczynski, a coral reef ecologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.""Species more tolerant of poor water quality will arrive first,"" Dr Zgliczynski said.Meanwhile, hard corals and fish would take longer to return, he added.A loss of coral reefs would also affect Tonga's ability to cope with rising waters and storm surges.This is a concern for Tonga, where climate change is driving the sea level to rise by about 6 millimetres per year, double the global average.In a 2015 report, Tonga valued its natural storm buffers — including coral reefs as well as coastal seagrasses and mangroves — at some $11 million annually.With the latest eruption, a Tongan sea-level gauge recorded a tsunami wave of 1.19 metres before it stopped reporting.Tsunamis are known to cause rapid coastal erosion.And before communication systems went down, videos revealed damage to man-made seawalls.""Coastal defences and reclaimed land could all be strongly impacted by the tsunami waves, leaving the islands more vulnerable,"" Professor Cronin said.ABC/wires","Agricultural Crops, Disasters and Accidents, Environment, Fiji, Foreign Aid, Marine Biology, Oceans and Reefs, Pacific, Tonga,

So yeah, we're all set to go,"" Mr Aston said.The couple is looking forward to snorkelling, zip-lining, relaxing on the beach and exploring Fiji's food markets.When deciding where to travel, Mr Aston said he chose Fiji because of its proximity to Australia, low COVID-19 case numbers and high rates of vaccination.More than 80 per cent of people in Fiji have been fully vaccinated, triggering the government's decision to reopen.It's cause for celebration in the country's tourism sector, which accounted for about 40 per cent of the country's GDP before the pandemic.Fiji welcomed more than 367,000 Australian tourists in 2019.""I've got a strong feeling that there'll be a lot of Aussies going over because it is a safe place to travel and it's quite close to home,"" Mr Aston said.Dr Regina Scheyvens, an expert in tourism and sustainable development at Massey University, said the strong response to Fiji's reopening showed Australians were itching to travel to the Pacific.""The idea of an escape is what people are after — a bit of luxury, a bit of leisure, some time in the sunshine, some time to relax. Absolutely, there's going to be huge demand,"" Dr Scheyvens said.Qantas will also begin flights to New Caledonia from January 1, although the island is currently in lockdown due to a COVID-19 outbreak.But other Pacific countries are taking a more cautious approach to reopening.""I think there's definitely enthusiasm from a number of Pacific governments to get their economies boosted again,"" Dr Scheyvens said.""But they've done a very good job, in many cases, of protecting their own populations … so for them, they don't want to risk their populations' health.""Vanuatu, a popular destination for Australians, has fully vaccinated just 17 per cent of its citizens.The country has recorded just four cases and one death, and has been COVID-free for almost six months. Cruise companies have started taking bookings to Vanuatu in May, but the country's director of public health, Len Tarivonda, said it was unlikely ships would be let in.""We're still months off,"" Mr Tarivonda said.He said a more likely date for reopening to international tourists was July next year.""If the virus were to get a foothold in Vanuatu, the implications for that would be … quite serious,"" Mr Tarivonda said.""Obviously, our health system here in Vanuatu is not as strong as perhaps in New Caledonia, in Fiji.""We're worried the virus might go like wildfire.""Right now, Vanuatu's focus is on getting more people immunised, particularly in regional areas.In Samoa, vaccination rates are much higher, with about 60 per cent of adults fully vaccinated and more than 90 per cent having had one dose.Last month, the country held a two-day vaccination drive, delivering jabs door-to-door.Still, the Samoan government is holding off on any announcements about borders.Samoa Tourism Authority CEO Fa'amatuainu Lenata'i Suifua said once 90 per cent of its eligible population had been fully vaccinated, the country would be ready to ""start discussions"" about international travel.""We need to actually ensure that the population is well protected,"" Fa'amatuainu said.In the meantime, Samoa's tourism industry is busy preparing to reopen and the government has already launched a COVID-19 tracing app that is expected to be mandatory for visitors.But when the country does open, Australians are unlikely to be first in line to travel there — with New Zealand tipped to take priority.""We have a really high number of Samoans living in New Zealand … all of them will be wanting to come home,"" Fa'amatuainu said.Dr Scheyvens said tourism-reliant countries would take an economic hit by delaying to reopen, but she expects strong demand when they do start accepting visitors.""What countries like Vanuatu and Samoa know is that the tourists are very loyal,"" she said.""They often get repeat visitors because people enjoy their experiences so much.""Dr Scheyvens said it was important to balance health risks against the economic imperative to reinstate international travel.That's a lesson French Polynesia learned the hard way.A decision to allow quarantine-free international travel to Tahiti in July 2020 saw the country suffer a large COVID-19 outbreak, causing the government to close its borders again in February 2021.French Polynesia has once again reopened its borders, but Dr Scheyvens said the outbreak had taken a big toll, with more than 600 recorded deaths.""It's a very tricky situation that countries have found themselves in because a lot of their economies have been quite devastated,"" she said.""It is really important that countries assess those risks.""And that's what I believe they're doing and why a lot of other countries in the Pacific have taken a bit longer to want to open the borders.""Additional reporting by Dan McGarry in Port Vila","COVID-19, Epidemics and Pandemics, Fiji, French Polynesia, Pacific, Samoa, Tourism and Leisure Industry, Travel Health and Safety, Travel and Tourism (Lifestyle and Leisure), Vanuatu, ",2021-10-15T18:08:00+00:00

We pray a lot.""And the issue of mental health is heightened by this kind of helplessness and loneliness during this time.""Dr Amanda Watson is a research fellow at the Australian National University's (ANU) department of Pacific affairs and said the cable, which goes between Tonga and Fiji, had been damaged before.In 2019, the cable was broken in at least two places by what was believed to be the anchor of a ship operating in an area that was supposed to be off-limits.The repairs in 2019 took around two weeks.Dr Watson said the cable was jointly owned by the Tongan Government, a state-owned enterprise in Tonga, and a private company. ""I imagine that the three of those will be working together quite closely to try to get the cable repaired as soon as possible,"" Dr Watson said.She said Tonga was not the only Pacific island that relied on a single cable to connect with the outside world, and hoped to see additional cables put in place in the future to avoid complete outages such as this one.Dr Anthony Bergin is a senior fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and said more work was needed to ensure the cables were more resilient in future.""I think what it highlights is, not only the vulnerability of the cables but [also] the actual landing stations where the cables meet the land,"" Dr Bergin said.""Australia should work with like-minded partners to undertake tabletop exercises around cable resilience because, if cables do break or are interfered with, it would be good if these countries had procedures in place to repair them.""Mr Fonua said a second cable had been ""on the table"", even before the cable was cut in 2019.""It's a matter of securing funding and also support from our Tongan partners."" he said.""It's not easy to build a second cable around Tonga because it's a small country.""He said that, because of the the location of Tonga in relation to Fiji and Australia, a second cable would likely end up on the same side the current one is.""So it's going be a tough one, but … the discussion is still going on at the moment,"" he said.""Hopefully we'll come up with some solutions soon.""ABC/AFP","Communication Development, Disasters and Accidents, Fiji, Foreign Aid, Internet, Oceans and Reefs, Pacific, Tonga, Vanuatu, Volcanic Eruptions, ",2022-01-17T19:35:39+00:00
77,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-02/pacific-blockchain-experiment-cryptocurrency-bitcoin/100495166,"It was beneath the thatched roof of a traditional meeting house in Pango village, Vanuatu, where many residents first learned about blockchain — the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. A team from Melbourne start-up Sempo, along with members of NGO Oxfam, were training villagers and vendors how to use Unblocked Cash, a pilot project funded in part by the Australian government.The system promised to ""revolutionise humanitarian aid"" by using a cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar — also called a stablecoin — to send money from donors directly to tap-and-pay cards given to participants.Not everyone who attended the training understood how blockchain or cryptocurrency worked, but many were keen to sign up to receive 10,000 Vatu ($122) in digital cash.The money was loaded onto tap-and-pay cards each month, which individuals could use in participating stores. Oxfam isn't alone in testing blockchain projects in the Pacific — a region which has some of the poorest internet connectivity in the world.Over the past five years, international NGOs, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Pacific governments and local programmers have developed world-first blockchain projects in the region.But critics fear the Pacific region is being used as a testing ground for experimental technology.Oxfam's blockchain project would go on to register 35,000 people in the Pacific region and has given more than $US2 million ($2.7 million) to participants.The transactions were tracked using a blockchain platform called Ethereum, allowing Oxfam to know exactly when, where and how the money is spent.""When they started, they selected single mothers, widows and widowers, and people with a disability,"" said a local store owner who attended the session in 2019.""Each person was entitled to one card, which had money inside it, and whatever they wanted inside my store they could then pay for it with their card.""Evelyn James, a participant from Port Vila, said receiving the money after signing up was a great benefit.""Just knowing that you have money, where you can go and buy something, it makes us really happy,"" she said.The team behind the project say it is revolutionary because, thanks to blockchain, cardholders don't need a bank account to receive donations.""There is a lot of lack of access in the Pacific right now, there's a high unbanked population ... So there's a lot of need for products like these,"" said Tristan Cole, the co-founder of Sempo who helped design the program.Jesse Gartner, Oxfam's cash transfer coordinator in Vanuatu, said the program pointed to the vast potential of blockchain technology in the Pacific.""Vanuatu is on the cutting edge of using this technology and it has allowed areas with very limited technological capacity to participate in a digital economy,"" he said.Put simply, blockchain is a digital public record where data is stored as ""blocks"" that are added to ""chains"" of information. The revolutionary aspect of blockchain is that there is no need for a middleman or institution to hold the information — instead, the entire blockchain is stored on thousands of computers around the world.If anyone wants to add a new block of data, all those computers need to verify the block and add it to the chain.The technology is commonly used for cryptocurrencies, where digital transactions are verified, recorded and added to the public record without the need for a central bank.The technology has spawned countless products in the Pacific – Oxfam uses blockchain to track donations on its Unblocked Cash program in real time, while Fiji and Asian Development Bank have developed a smart contract system to monitor the sale of indigenous land.A Fijian company uses blockchain technology to monitor fisheries around the Pacific. Tuvalu is developing a ""national digital ledger"" using blockchain, so that government services can be accessed on a transparent online system.The government also hopes to develop a blockchain digital payment system so its citizens can conveniently shop online.Tenanoia Simona, who heads the digital ledger project from Tuvalu's Ministry of Justice, Communications and Foreign Affairs, said their intention was to ""leapfrog Tuvalu into the digital space"".""The idea of using blockchain technology is to ensure resilience, transparency, integrity of government services,"" she said.Jessica Marinaccio from the  Ministry of Justice, who is also involved in the project, said it was quicker and cheaper to test blockchain technology in smaller Pacific nations than larger countries like Australia.""It kind of allows Tuvalu and places like the Marshall Islands, which have small populations, to really push themselves farther ahead in terms of technology.""Tuvalu hopes to soon offer a tender for a company to help develop the blockchain system for its government. But for critics, the desire to test the technology in Pacific Islands is a cause for concern.Olivier Jutel, from the University of Otago in New Zealand, has been studying the rise of cryptocurrency in the Pacific.He said blockchain projects were often a form of ""backdoor privatisation"", and an opportunity for foreign companies to test their products on Pacific populations.""They become very myopic, and don't think about the complexity of Pacific and developing world societies.""Many Pacific countries have laws against cryptocurrency, which can hinder the aspirations of blockchain innovators. For instance, Vanuatu prohibits trading cryptocurrencies, which has meant Oxfam's Unblocked Cash system relies on traditional cash stored in a private bank account.Though participants pay for their groceries using digital tokens given to them by Oxfam, the shops are reimbursed by Oxfam using a regular bank transfer.As a result, store owners do need a bank account to be part of Unblocked Cash, which has meant some local businesses in Vanuatu's villages can't take part.A shop owner in Pango village, who did not want to be named out of fear of being singled out by the community, said they weren't able to run their small store while waiting for Oxfam's reimbursements.They were also upset that larger businesses in the city were invited to take part and decided to leave the program after a couple of months.""They included all wholesale stores and hardware stores in town as well. So I found that I didn't have many customers,"" the store owner said.""If you're thinking about helping a local shop owner in the village, why would you open this out in town?""Freda Willy, another participant of the project, said she was grateful for the money but wished cheaper, local stores would also accept her card.""There's only one [participating] vendor at the market. You have to go when she's there or you can't buy the food,"" she said.Oxfam has said only 9 per cent of the 352 vendors in the project were large supermarkets, and 54 per cent were community stores or fresh food sellers.Mr Gartner from Oxfam said the feedback from both vendors and cardholders had been overwhelmingly positive, but his team was working to better support local businesses.While some countries face regulatory hurdles, others have tried to implement laws to develop cryptocurrency within the Pacific.Israeli entrepreneur Barak Ben-Ezer has developed a cryptocurrency for the Marshall Islands called the Sovereign, or SOV.In 2018, the country passed a law to make the cryptocurrency its national legal tender.The project has since stalled, but Mr Ben-Ezer remains optimistic.""There's a big opportunity here,"" he said.In Tonga, MP Lord Fusitu'a is drafting a bill to make Bitcoin a legal tender in the Pacific nation, like what was done in El Salvador last month.He believed ""developing and emerging markets"" like those in the Pacific stand to benefit the most from cryptocurrency, since they relied so heavily on international banks and the associated fees.In Tonga for example, 40 per cent of its national GDP comes from people abroad sending money back to family, and Lord Fusitu'a said by using cryptocurrency like Bitcoin instead of traditional banks, those remittances could be cheaper and faster. But despite his support for Bitcoin, Lord Fusitu'a said he was concerned some people in the Pacific might be tempted to support unlisted alt-coins or speculative blockchain projects.""If you put your life savings into something that's not on that [regulated] list, that's gone,"" he said.Concerns around cryptocurrency aside, many believe the underlying blockchain technology holds the key to accelerating development in the region.""I don't see this as being experimental, I see this as being pioneering,"" Mr Gartner from Oxfam said.""Blockchain is here. It's not going away.""","Cryptocurrency, Fiji, Information Technology Industry, Marshall Islands, Pacific, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, ",2021-10-01T19:16:56+00:00

my family [and] village community, I don't actually know what my future would be like, and … what the survival of my future would be.""Shannon, like many children and young people in the Pacific, is paying close attention to the developments and outcomes of the COP26 conference currently taking place in Glasgow. The future for the region — according to modelling from Save the Children's Born into The Climate Crisis report — looks grim, with children in Australia and the Pacific predicted to experience up to 10 times more extreme weather events than their ancestors. Worldwide, that figure jumps to 24 times as many climate-induced extreme weather events, for children born in 2020.The report says a baby born last year in Papua New Guinea will face 10 times the heat waves and double the risk of fires than were experienced by their elders. Meanwhile, children in Vanuatu are predicted to face nearly three times as many droughts.It is not a future that Tanya Watsivi McGarry*, 9, who lives in Vanuatu, is willing to accept.""No, I wouldn't want to grow up in a world like that where there was more climate change, where there were storms, because I would not feel like that was right,"" Tanya says.Even at nine years of age, Tanya is old enough to remember bunkering down when Cyclone Pam tore through her home six years ago. ""We were all squashed up in the bathroom,"" Tanya says, recalling the category five cyclone.""We could hear the glass shattering and the water came up."" She rememberers feeling ""very scared"", worried about the trees that surrounded her home. Just last year, her home island of Pentecost was devastated by Cyclone Harold, tearing infrastructure apart and decimating crops and resources. ""It was terrible,"" Tanya says. ""All the fruits, the vegetables, the island cabbage, all of that was destroyed.""Then it couldn't grow anymore."" Growing up in the shadow of climate change, the young girl recognises the role foreign countries will play in the region's future.""There [are] people out there who are trying to do their best and then there [are] people out there who are not trying to do their best,"" she says.Tanya's sentiments reflect those of Pacific leaders, who have criticised Australia for not having ambitious enough emissions reduction targets.Late last month, Australia committed to a target to reach net zero by 2050.Earlier this week, Pacific Island leaders pressed Prime Minster Scott Morrison to make sharper cuts to Australia's emissions this decade.During his speech to world leaders, Mr Morrison said Australia would increase its climate finance commitment to its Pacific and South-East Asian neighbours by $500 million over the next five years, to reach a total of $2 billion. In Fiji, Aiyanna Nacewa, 8, and her classmates are learning what to do in the event of a cyclone. ""We learn [if] one big storm hits, we should board up, save our electricity and save our water and food and close up the windows and doors,"" Aiyanna says.While the lessons help students understand how to prepare for natural disasters, they do little to ease the fear children like Aiyanna have internalised about natural disasters and climate change. ""When a first cyclone hit with thunder and lightning, I looked outside the window and I was scared because my thoughts were that lightning could hit our house and, and that's when it could make a hole through the roof.""Shannon has witnessed communities searching for food, water and shelter after cyclones that have flattened villages in the Solomon Islands.""This country is very vulnerable to natural disasters, houses, villages and even lives were lost due to natural disasters,"" Shannon says.""So, to what it means to grow up with cyclones and extreme weather, [it] basically means to grow up with fear, fear of dying, fear of losing my own home, and also fear of trying to survive.""I understand that this is not an easy issue that world leaders could address overnight. ""But I would want the world leaders to please sympathise with us Pacific Island countries, and see how my own people are struggling to survive due to climate

Most of the passports, which allow free access to any EU country, are sold to people from mainland China.  It has long been controversial, but the scheme came under increased scrutiny in July after the Guardian investigation was published.Last week, the Vanuatu government revealed that the Vanuatu citizenship of a Syrian businessman referred to in the report, Abdul Rhama Khiti, had been revoked.Vanuatu's Citizenship Commission chair Ronald Warsal told the ABC's Pacific Beat program the US government had imposed sanctions against Mr Khiti's businesses just weeks after he had made his application.""After the article came out in The Guardian and during the course of the investigation by our Financial Intelligence Unit [FIU] it was decided to have it revoked and money he has paid to be forfeited into government coffers,"" Mr Warsal said.He said the government was investigating more of those mentioned in the article and others that were not.""It's an ongoing thing,"" he said.""We want to ensure that people who come to Vanuatu, who obtain Vanuatu citizenship, are not wanted abroad [and] are not fugitives.""Transparency International Vanuatu chief executive Willie Tokon said it was worrying that the Syrian businessman was able to get approval in the first place and that his citizenship was only revoked when the matter was raised in the media.""My worry is how come we have all these allegations but the screening by [the] Citizenship Commission and Financial Intelligence Unit didn't come up with this allegation,"" Mr Tokon said.He said if Vanuatu did not have the capacity to thoroughly vet applicants, it should seek help from Interpol and other agencies.""If there's no other way to do it, do it properly. If we don't have the capacity, we have very strong support from the Australian government in terms of the AFP, they're providing a lot of support. It needs to be done properly,"" he said.But Mr Warsal said the government had systems in place to do character checks.""We do [make] the final decision but … it goes through certain processes,"" he said, saying it was down to teamwork between immigration, the FIU and the police.Economics professor Stephen Howes, from the Australian National University, said mishandling of the citizenship programs could have a couple of negative consequences for Vanuatu.Mr Howes said Vanuatu could become seen as a ""risky"" country for banks to operate in, or even get added to international money laundering grey or blacklists, which would threaten the country's ability to access international finance.""That would further isolate the country and make it harder to form international financial links,"" he said.It could also diminish the value of Vanuatu passports, making it more difficult for Vanuatu citizens to travel.""Vanuatu citizens might suffer as well if other countries decide that they don't trust that someone with a valid Vanuatu passport is actually a bonafide Vanuatu citizen,"" he said.On the flip side, if Vanuatu did decide to scrap the citizenship schemes, then they would lose the revenue the country needs to support the population during the pandemic-related economic crisis.Mr Howes said it was more likely the government would bring in reforms and tighten up the application process.He said actions like cancelling the citizenship of those like Mr Khiti would show they ""won't take just anyone"".""If they can show [they have a serious vetting process], that will instil more confidence into the scheme,"" he said. He said abandoning the ""unorthodox"" source of revenue would be a ""really extreme step"".Not everyone who wanted citizenship of another country and could afford to buy it was necessarily of bad character, he said.""Think about the uncertainties in China, some people just want a safety net,"" he said. ""The world's a very uncertain place. So I don't think it means you're a criminal [if you want to buy citizenship].""I think it could also mean you're worried about the future of your country.""","Economic Sanctions, Immigration Policy, Pacific, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2021-08-17T18:42:53+00:00

Australians will realise it's the same with kava — you have a kava in the afternoon to relax."" Australia banned imports more than 20 years ago due to the drink being abused in some remote Indigenous communities. The federal government announced a small trial of commercial imports last year which has been postponed until the end of 2021.It has also increased the amount people can bring into the country for personal use from 2 to 4 kilograms.Mr Louze said they were not confident the trial would go ahead. ""There has been talk about removing the ban for kava in Australia for so many years,"" he said. ""It feels like it's a never ending story. It's not happening and we don't know if it's going to happen ever."" Mr Dempsey said growing it in Australia could help increase the amount of kava on the world market. ""There is a limitation in space within those particular islands,"" he said. ""The market is growing worldwide and they are looking for places and secure markets to be able to have a benefit for their home nations."" Mr Fare said Vanuatu and other Pacific Island countries were not suffering shortfalls in production  ""If Australia would open the market there would be enough product to be exported here,"" he said. ""In order to be able to export kava to the Australian market under the commercial pilot we have to do a lot of work."" Mr Louze said he's doubtful it could be successfully grown in Australia anyway.  ""The weather, the soil would be totally different, so it would not be easy,"" he said. ""It's not a one-year crop, it's a minimum of 3 to 4 years before you can harvest it,"" Mr Louze said.He said kava would put even more pressure on the agriculture industry's worker shortage ""Australia already has many labour issues, they have to import labour from the Pacific,"" Mr Louze said.""Kava is labour intensive.

Not that anyone really wants to talk about it — at least until the deal's inked.But it's all about China and making sure that Beijing doesn't get its mitts on a key strategic asset.Irish billionaire Denis O'Brien is the owner and founder of Digicel, which through its subsidiary Digicel Pacific controls the region's leading telecommunications businesses.Digicel Pacific has 91 per cent of the phone and broadband market in Papua New Guinea, 65 per cent in Vanuatu, 69 per cent in Samoa, 58 per cent in Tonga, 32 per cent in Fiji and 100 per cent in Nauru.The company makes a handsome profit, too — about $300 million-plus a year.That's not the sort of market dominance or earnings to sneeze at, unless of course the parent company is wallowing in unmanageable debt.Digicel (the parent company) filed for bankruptcy in Bermuda 13 months ago and proposed refinancing its $US7.4 billion debt, which it did to the satisfaction of bond holders.Whether O'Brien then began looking at parts of his business to offload is unclear, but an inquiry came his way from Beijing about his interests in the Pacific.China is always on the hunt for a tactical purchase.And this is where the Australian taxpayer comes in.That's because China Mobile, the biggest telecoms operator in China, has shown interest in buying Digicel Pacific, which would be a superb strategic pick-up for Beijing.In recent days, Chinese telecom giant Huawei struck a $6 billion agreement to build the majority of China Mobile's 5G base stations. And few would need reminding that Huawei was banned by the federal government from taking part in Australia's 5G rollout in 2018, a decision that is widely believed to have triggered retaliatory trade tariffs.Stopping Digicel Pacific ending up in the hands of a Chinese company is seen almost as strategically important as stopping Huawei getting a hold in Australia's 5G network.That's especially since Digicel Pacific uses a 4,700km undersea cable from Sydney largely funded by the Australian government in 2018 to prevent PNG and the Solomon Islands contracting Huawei for the project.Similarly, Australia, the United States and Japan will finance an optic cable for Palau. Nauru wants one, too.Behind the scenes, the government has been asking Telstra to buy Digicel Pacific for national security reasons.And it is determined to make the deal a no-brainer for the Australian telco.The way it would work is this:Telstra would have to cough up between $400 million and $500 million to take an equity stake. Another $1.5 billion or so would be borrowed from the federal government at ""mate's rates"", say 2.5 to 3 per cent, which is above the rate at which the government can borrow it but is still extremely competitive.If the interest rate is 3 per cent, Telstra would pay $45 million a year on its $1.5 billion loan from the Commonwealth, while also receiving $300 million or so a year in profits from Digicel Pacific's business in the region.After interest payments, that's a cool quarter of a billion dollar profit from a strategically sensitive purchase.The taxpayer would benefit, too. It would be paid the difference between the cost of the government's borrowings (about 1 per cent) and the return from its loan to Telstra (at 3 per cent), which works out to be $30 million a year.All while serving the national interest.What's not to love?The government has its collective fingers and toes crossed that Telstra sees it that way.","Australia, Federal Government, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Telecommunications Services Industry, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2021-07-20T07:30:34+00:00

You could lose two or three kilometres of actual shoreline,"" Cr Fisher said.The beetle causes damage by boring into the plant's stem and feeding on the sap, damaging the developing leaves.The plant will then be defoliated and will die during a heavy infestation.The beetle lays eggs in decaying matter and then moves on.""We knew it was a risk, but it wasn't until it got into large horticulture and agriculture areas in Hawaii that suddenly the red flags went up,"" Cr Fisher said.He said Hawaii had similar horticulture and plant culture to Australia. On top of the obvious economic threat to the country's $2 billion sugar industry and $53 million pineapple industry, Cr Fisher said the beetle could pose a threat to other plants.""If it's in pineapples, what about bromeliads? It's an up-and-coming collector choice for gardeners. And if it can get into sugar cane, what is the risk to other canes and bamboos?"" he said.Cr Fisher said it was important to work with universities to find a new biological control to keep the insect at bay.Dr Etebari and his team at UQ are studying why the virus is no longer controlling the beetle and their findings would be critical to managing the pest if it got a foothold in Australia.""The question is how do we stop it? And what's gone wrong with the control that's been effective for the past five decades?"" Dr Etebari said.The researchers discovered that there have been several new waves of beetle invasions, not one as previously thought, as well as different types of beetles.They also found there were variations to the beetle virus which was originally sourced from Malaysia.""It's similar to how other scientists spot different strains of COVID-19. We are detecting variations in the beetle virus in the Pacific,"" Dr Etebari said.""In our case the problem is more complicated because there are different types of beetles and different strains of the beetle virus.""Their next step was finding out how the virus variations behaved in the different beetles and how that could be used to control them.Dr Etebari said it was important for Australia to help its Pacific neighbours to tackle the pest, not just for economic reasons, but also humanitarian. ""It's a serious threat to livelihoods across the Pacific islands as the coconut tree provides essential resources like food, copra, building material, and the coastal protection for more than five million vulnerable people,"" he said.A Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment spokesperson said it was working with biosecurity counterparts in PNG and Solomon Islands to track and monitor the spread of the new beetle strain.The department was also actively monitoring the spread of the beetle strains through PNG, particularly in the Western Province and PNG Treaty Village areas bordering Australia's northern Torres Strait Islands. The spokesperson said the department was also supporting regional initiatives that were dealing with the coconut rhinoceros beetle.ABC Capricornia will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Friday.

""He is the spirit of kastom so we pray through the sacred kava ritual,"" a spokesman for Yaohnanen village, Jimmy Joseph Nakouo, said. Since news of his death filtered through — mostly by international journalists — people in the villages of Yakel and Yaohnanen have come to pay their respects.At Yaohnanen village, the Union Jack flag flew at half-mast and hundreds of people took part in a small ceremony under a large banyan tree in the centre of the village, called a nakamal, or meeting place.Men drank kava — a traditional beverage popular in many Pacific island countries — which is made from the kava plant's ground roots and has a mildly euphoric effect.It is a significant part of Vanuatu's ""kastoms"", the country's traditional cultures and customs. Jean Pascal Wahe, who works at the Vanuatu Cultural Centre, visited both villages this week.""They are sorry [to hear of his death] but they're also glad because they say his body will remain in the UK but his spirit will return to Tanna,"" he said.But there are also questions now as to who might take on the special relationship they had with Prince Philip. In 1974, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip visited the New Hebrides, before it became Vanuatu, where the Prince handed over a white pig to a member of the Tanna community during an event in the capital, Port Vila.Anthropologists said the gift catapulted him into the centre of a long-running prophecy that has its roots in the clash of culture between the early European missionaries and the traditional tribes. People in the villages of Yakel and Yaohnanen have an ancient legend that tells of a group of warriors who left, a long time ago, to fight a war on a faraway island so as to preserve their culture.""The spirit of kastom tried to protect people from Christianity … [the spirit] told the people, 'I need to go to the source of the threatening',"" Mr Nakou said.""That's the time [it] went to England."" According to the prophecy, the leader of the group vowed to one day return with a rich, powerful and white wife.This is how the islanders saw Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth's visit in 1974, believing him to be a physical representation of the ancient warrior leader returning home.It is believed that the Prince's gift of the pig allowed the people of Yaohnanen and Yakel to form a strong link with him.They wanted him to live in their villages and followers, who are estimated to now stand at around 400, patiently waited for his return. Kirk Huffman, an anthropologist who has known members of the Prince Philip movement since the 1970s, said it is common for tribes on Tanna to believe in prophecies or ""visions"".""These sorts of visionary movements have been going on … for centuries,"" Mr Huffman said, who is also an honorary curator of Vanuatu's National Museum.""You get visions and you try and attract followers, that's one of the cultural ball games on Tanna.""He said that such beliefs play an important role in Tannese culture, which ""doesn't follow linear logic and they don't have to because there are lots of other logical systems around"".""In the white man system, we're all brought up on this jolly stupid linear education system which blinds us to this whole much wider view of reality.""But he said the world's interest in the Prince Philip movement has also played a role.""The more film crews that arrive, the more supporters they get. It's a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy, in a way"".There was regular correspondence between Prince Philip and his followers dating back to the late 1970s and in 2007, five members of the community visited him for a meeting at Windsor Castle as part of a UK Channel 4 television series. While Prince Philip's followers believe that his spirit will now return to Tanna, they have also held discussions about his possible successor.Kirk Huffman said that in line with Vanuatu culture — where the customs dictate that the chiefly titles are passed on to male descendants — they might transfer their allegiance to the next in line, Prince Charles.Cultural officer Jean Pascal Wahe said that followers have not yet made any decisions but would leave the matter to the Royal family.""They've said that if [Prince] Charles wants to continue to hold this title … and maintain the connection, then that would be fine,"" he said.""But if not, the spirit of Prince Philip would go into one of his other adult children, or a grandchild, and in the future, they could continue the connection"".But anthropologist Kirk Huffman said it was likely the group would continue to use the name of Prince Philip.He said he was also recently advised that it may even become a political movement, following in the footsteps of another group, the John Frum Movement, which is also on the island of Tanna.""They stand in the local elections, they have a Member of Parliament,"" he said.""What's going on is actually traditional internal power politics. Clan alliances … jealousies, all sorts of stuff.

The doses will be drawn from stockpiles manufactured by CSL in its new Melbourne plant.The process will begin in May, but the government is confident it can ramp up delivery quickly after that. It is aiming to achieve 20 per cent coverage in the Pacific by the end of June, with help from vaccines distributed under the COVAX facility.Mr Morrison is also expected to announce the government will grant a request from Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape, who has asked Australia for an immediate supply of COVID-19 vaccines for frontline health workers in his country.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicPNG's health system has been placed under enormous strain by the pandemic. The numbers of new cases are spiking dramatically, and officials warning hospitals are now close to collapse.One federal government source confirmed that Australia had agreed to help PNG by supplying it with an immediate and “limited” supply of vaccines for medical and other essential workers. They did not say exactly how many doses would be provided. Australian and PNG officials have been in near-constant communication as they hammer out a coordinated response to the rapidly escalating health threat.  The situation in PNG has been deteriorating steadily. In the first week of March, 17 per cent of all people who were tested throughout the country were positive to COVID-19 and Mr Marape said earlier this week that one in three or four people in PNG could soon be infected.Some 114 staff at PNG's largest hospital, the Port Moresby General Hospital, have now tested positive to COVID-19.""We expect more cases to come in the next few weeks or so and we can't afford to lose our staff, the way we are going, so we're looking forward to the vaccinations so we can protect our staff,"" hospital chief excutive Paki Molumi told the ABC.Aid groups have also been pressing the government to take action to help PNG cope with the health crisis.A federal government spokesman said that Mr Morrison spoke to Mr Marape on Tuesday afternoon to finalise a support package.""The Prime Minister spoke to Prime Minister Marape about the ongoing situation and what more Australia can do to support the PNG government, and also protect both countries,” they said.The federal government's announcement on the broader vaccine rollout has been anticipated for weeks. It has previously announced it will spend $200 million on delivering COVID-19 vaccines to Pacific Island countries. But today's announcement will likely provide more details on which countries will be prioritised, as well as the timetable for distribution.The rollout is expected to initially focus on a number of Melanesian countries including Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Timor Leste is also expected to be a high priority, as are some very small Pacific Island states.The Pacific rollout is one of several vaccine commitments from the federal government, which is ramping up efforts to boost the region's health response and cement Australian diplomatic influence.The government has already pledged $80 million to the Gavi COVAX Facility, which is being used to distribute vaccines to low-income countries across the globe, including in the Pacific.Australia has also pledged to distribute vaccines in some South-East Asian countries and on the weekend joined a new vaccine initiative from the Quad, which has vowed to ramp up vaccine production by 1 billion doses by 2022.","Asia, Australia, COVID-19, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Vaccines and Immunity, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2021-03-16T19:14:53+00:00

But on Tuesday (local time), High Commissioner Samson Fare took to social media to complain about the treatment of Ni-Vanuatu workers in the town of Bundaberg.""This week I urgently came to see 51 of our valuable SWP workers in Bundaberg QLD that got sacked by [their] employer,"" he said on Twitter.""They have lots of issues & some very serious, e.g. death threat. This has to be fixed immediately.""The details of the dispute remain murky. The ABC has contacted the High Commissioner to ask for more information, but he would not say who had allegedly made a death threat, saying he was focussed on finding the best solution for the workers. ""I am still busy with our workers and various pastoral issues that should have been addressed by the [Australian] Department of Education, Skills and Employment,"" he said.However, the ABC has been told it's alleged that some of the men had previously abandoned the workplace which legally employed them under the SWP and had started working illegally for a second regional employer which had promised better pay.But it's alleged that the workers quickly grew unhappy about their new situation, complaining that they were overcharged for poor quality accommodation and were earning less than they hoped. Allegedly, tensions later boiled over when their new employer dismissed them, saying there was no longer any work available. A spokesperson for the Department of Education, Skills and Employment said the death threat allegation made by the High Commissioner was ""very concerning."" ""Any allegations of serious threats against SWP workers should be referred to the police immediately,"" they said.""The government has zero tolerance for exploitation of workers and underpayment of wages and entitlements.""It's understood that several government agencies are now trying to find the men new employers under the SWP.Sister Janine Bliss from the Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking of Humans in Bundaberg said the workers were facing a ""terrible situation"". ""Most of them have been labelled as runaways, as absconders. This is a term that's derogatory. There needs to be some work done on addressing the real issues,"" she said. ""They're certainly distressed at losing their jobs."" The episode highlights some of the problems which have plagued the SWP over the last year. When state borders closed in 2020, large numbers of seasonal workers struggled to find work and some left their legal employers because of low work hours, as well as high transport and accommodation costs. Some workers also complained they had been lured by false promises of higher pay from unscrupulous labour-hire firms. Satish Chand from the UNSW School of Business said the controversy could damage the program's reputation, even though it had an overwhelmingly positive impact in both Australia and Pacific Island countries. ""Importantly, and to the best of my knowledge, the majority of the employers are doing the right thing by their employees,"" he told the ABC.""The drought in terms of backpackers and Kiwis on our farms is making the SWP workers all the more essential for an industry that was experiencing labour shortages before the pandemic."" Professor Chand said the federal government should consider reshaping the program to allow seasonal workers to move between employers in Australia. ""[That way] the competitive forces of demand for these workers can lead to improved conditions for the workers,"" he said. ""Bad employers will get weeded out in the process. Tying workers to a single employer, at whose mercy workers are for shifts, is a recipe for exploitation of the sponsored workers.""","Bundaberg, Farm Labour, Pacific, Programs and Initiatives, QLD, Vanuatu, ",2021-02-25T09:33:02+00:00

However, Mr Cattle said the problem could be solved with the stroke of a pen if the Federal Government set up a travel bubble for Pacific Islanders.He suggested the New Zealand travel bubble system be adapted to include 22,000 pre-vetted islander workers.Federal Agriculture Minister David Littleproud this week repeated calls for the states to take action and fix the situation.He said the situation had been coming ""at us like a freight train"" since March.""We continue to press them to say that we're ready to stamp the visas … but we still haven't seen them come up with any large-scale quarantine arrangements,"" Mr Littleproud said.Jaclyn Symes was replaced as Victoria's Agriculture Minister just before Christmas. Prior to her departure, Ms Symes repeatedly told the ABC an announcement on the matter would be made in ""coming days"". However, her replacement, Mary-Anne Thomas, has not yet agreed to an interview. In New South Wales, Agriculture Minister Adam Marshall took aim at Mr Littleproud.""It beggars belief that the Federal Agriculture Minister is passing the buck onto the states when what we actually need is national leadership on this issue,"" he said.""The Federal Government continues to sit on its hands saying this is a matter for industry, but they control our international borders and have the ability to authorise travel bubbles — not the states.""Some states have made progress. About 160 seasonal workers flew into Perth from Vanuatu last week.Another flight has been approved to bring a further 158 Pacific Islanders into Western Australia next week, with a third group expected to arrive in March.One of WA's largest table grape growers, Fruitico, has managed to secure 105 workers for their vineyards in Pinjarra, Hamel and Broome.Chief executive Roger Fahl said it was a good start towards filling labour shortages to pick more than 500,000 cartons of grapes — a crop that is shaping up to be the company's largest on record.""It's only about a third of our workforce, so we're still chasing a whole lot of staff, but the seasonal workers do give us nine months of a stable workforce,"" Mr Fahl said.""That's the reality of it at the moment. I don't think any grower in the state will have enough workforce to get all the crops off.""Companies will pick what they can and if there are shortages it will means price rises [for consumers].""In Tasmania, 160 workers from Tonga will be out of hotel quarantine in Hobart next week. They will pick berries around the state, leaving local cherry growers in the lurch.Meanwhile in central Queensland, fears of a major shortage in labour haven't been realised thanks, in part, to backpackers and local students.Franziska Hinze arrived in Australia from Germany just days before Australia shut its borders due to the pandemic.Ms Hinze, who holds a working holiday visa and is travelling with her boyfriend, is now packing mangoes, and says she's planning on staying in Australia to wait out the pandemic for as long as possible.""We're trying to find jobs on farms because, to be honest, it's quite nice to work on a farm, you're just picking and you kind of relax a little bit, especially your mind,"" she said.Adam Farley is an organic zucchini grower near Swan Hill in north-west Victoria.He has been picking them for about a month and has turned off water to two hectares of crops because he will not have staff to pick them. ""The price is down, even weather conditions have hindered us … but labour shortages have been our main issue,"" Mr Farley said.""To make that decision to turn the paddock off, it's just not natural, it doesn't sit well on any level [and] it's heartbreaking.""At the end of the day you have to do it.""","Agricultural Crops, Broome, Crop Harvesting, Farm Labour, Hobart, Kununurra, Mackay, Mildura, Perth, Pinjarra, Swan Hill, Tonga, Trade, Vanuatu, Vegetables, ",2021-01-01T20:22:35+00:00

Minister MacTiernan said initially the focus would be on recruiting ni-Vanuatu workers that have already quarantined in the Howard Springs facility near Darwin. ""When they are finished doing their tasks in the Northern Territory, mainly picking mangoes, we will welcome them to come into Western Australia,"" Ms MacTiernan said.""Of course, our absolute priority is always keeping the people of Western Australia safe but we're confident this program can now be managed properly.""This will go some way to filling the labour shortage for this season's harvest, but it is not a panacea.""Our growers will still require thousands of local workers to get the harvest off and will need to demonstrate that they cannot fill their labour requirements locally.""Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, WA growers employed around 1,000 Seasonal Worker Program workers, with the majority of remaining harvest jobs filled by working holiday makers.Last month, the State Government launched the Work and Wander Out Yonder campaign and related worker incentives scheme to encourage West Australians to help fill labour gaps across regional WA.Ms MacTiernan admitted the efforts and programs put in place until now had not been sufficient to solve the worker shortage problem facing the state's fruit and vegetable growers.She said that only 58 people had submitted a claim for the travel and accommodation assistance on offer to encourage West Australians to wander out yonder and take a job in regional WA.""Our campaign has drawn real interest from local jobseekers and our priority will remain local workers,"" Ms MacTiernan said.""However, without further Federal Government action to incentivise those on JobSeeker to take up agricultural work, we are implementing further measures to support our growers.""With backpackers unable to come to Australia due to the Federal Government's international border closures, allowing growers to access the Seasonal Worker Program and Pacific Labour Scheme will help to ensure we can fill critical labour shortages in our primary industries.""It was also revealed the State Government was in discussions with the NT and Federal governments to bring an additional 400 seasonal workers from Vanuatu and Timor Leste into the country, and use the Howard Springs facility as a quarantine base for workers travelling across to WA.Ms MacTiernan said she was confident some Vanuatu workers working in the Territory would be available to WA as early as the end of October or early November.She also flagged the possibility of bringing in additional seasonal workers next year should the initiative prove successful.Shadow agriculture spokesman Steve Thomas welcomed the announcement but slammed the State Government for being ""too slow"" to act.He said the WA agricultural industry still needed around 7,000 workers across the upcoming horticultural and grain harvests.""We have had two months of great uncertainty in the agriculture sector because this Government would not accept the inevitable,"" Dr Thomas said.""Farmers have been worried about where they're going to get their workers from. They have been ploughing some of their crops back in, they have not planned as they would have done previously.""All of those reflect a lower economy because this Government was too proud to acknowledge the simple reality that we needed these workers in Western Australia.""Dr Thomas called on the Government to work with the Commonwealth to bring workers into WA as soon as possible.Up in the Kimberley, Ord Valley farmer David Menzel said the new measures to bring in seasonal workers was too late for the majority of horticultural crops in the region like pumpkins and melons, which had mostly been picked.Mr Menzel, who is also the president of the Shire of Wyndham and East Kimberley, said mango growers who had just started picking in the Kimberley could possibly benefit.But he said that would be dependent on the mango harvest across the border finishing up with enough time to get workers across to pick and pack in Kununurra over the next couple of weeks.However, Mr Menzel said the news had come in time for growers making critical decision around next year's planting schedule.""It's probably a little bit late for here … but what's done is done,"" he said.""I think the more important thing is that the WA Government is finally putting a pathway in place where we may be able to get a workforce into WA, and that's been one of the concerns for such a long time.""This gives us a great boost of confidence that we would be able to access those workers that we've had a relationship over many years, particularly in the Ord.""Mr Menzel said in recent years, farmers in the Ord Irrigation Scheme had relied heavily on workers from Timor Leste who were more ""reliable"" and ""motivated"" than the backpacker workforce.WA Strawberry Association President Neil Handasyde said the announcement was really good news for growers in the southern part of the state, but came too late for struggling farmers around Perth.""The majority of the strawberries that are in the market now from the Wanneroo, Bullsbrook, Gingin area, they're short staffed and working incredibly long days to try and keep up,"" he said.""So it's not going to help those guys at all, but it certainly will help the October through to March-April areas [like] Pemberton, Mt Barker, Albany, Manjimup.""Mr Handasyde, who grows strawberries in Albany, said the move would not fix labor shortages but it would offer some relief.""There's more to do, but it's a really good step,"" he said.The Nationals WA leader Mia Davies said the State Government's response to the labor shortage crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic had been inadequate.Ms Davies said she had raised the prospect of workforce shortages as early as March with the Agriculture Minister, encouraging the Government to put plans in place to stem the loss of interstate and international workers.""Pinching a couple of hundred of labourers after the Northern Territory and Federal Government have done the heavy lifting to bring them into the country just doesn't cut it,"" she said.""WA families need to realise their higher grocery costs at Christmas are a direct result of the Labor Government sitting on their hands for the last seven months while our primary industries scream out for support to access more workers.""The Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development will place a five-person team within the WA Police Force to help manage the new measures that will see NT seasonal workers travel to WA farms in the coming weeks.The State Government said it would also allow for greater movement of critical agricultural workers from interstate — subject to usual isolation and quarantine requirements.The Work and Wander Out Yonder campaign will continue to roll out and will ramp up activities in November to encourage university students and school leavers into the industry ahead of the summer holidays.","Agribusiness, Agricultural Policy, Agriculture, Albany, Broome, Bullsbrook, COVID-19, Darwin, Derby, Farm Labour, Federal - State Issues, Fitzroy Crossing, Gingin, Halls Creek, Industrial Relations, Kununurra, Manjimup, Mount Barker, Pacific, Pemberton, State and Territory Government, Vanuatu, Wanneroo, Wyndham, ",2020-10-16T00:52:14+00:00

Between April to June, that figure had more than doubled to 22.5 million.But as Mr Benko's case reveals, this AI technology is also causing images of Indigenous Pacific bodies to be incorrectly targeted and removed, even though that nudity does not violate Facebook's standards.Digital media researcher Fiona Martin, from the University of Sydney, said there could be negative consequences if the machine-learning algorithms used to moderate social media content weren't ""culturally nuanced"".""There is a danger that they are going to over-regulate, that they're going to over-censor material that otherwise may not be offensive in a particular cultural group,"" she said. ""I think it's really important that not only Facebook, but all of the social media platforms, start to take into account the cultural specificity of images and visual communication.""Mr Benko is not the only Pacific user who has been tangled up in Facebook's AI system.In 2018, an image of Melanesian warriors taken by Australian photojournalist Ben Bohane was also blocked on the platform, sparking accusations that Facebook was not respecting Pacific culture.And earlier this year, Facebook blocked users from sharing an International Federation of Journalists article on press freedoms in the Pacific, which included an image of West Papuan protesters dressed in traditional outfits.Professor David Robie, director of the Pacific Media Centre, was blocked from sharing the article on Facebook.He called the experience a ""tyranny of algorithms"", and believes people who wanted to stop information about West Papuan protesters were able to exploit Facebook policies for their own political goals.""The photo is clearly not nudity in the accepted sense,"" Dr Robie said. ""The FB [Facebook] block was an excuse to delete the entire news item to prevent readers reading the items about Papuan news media censorship and blackouts.""Dr Robie was particularly frustrated that appeals to Facebook to overturn the decision were not answered, a situation Mr Benko also encountered when trying to unblock his account.""They said they'd review the content and come back to me, but they never came back to me. They just put my account back,"" Mr Benko said.Online media expert Dr Martin said companies need to better communicate with their users, particularly in matters of cultural sensitivity.""It would be really helpful if there were more direct market specialist contacts in local areas for the platforms,"" Dr Martin said.""If these platforms want to benefit from user-generated content, they need to be accountable to users for their content regulation.""","Censorship, Community and Society, Indigenous (Other Peoples), Information and Communication, Pacific, Social Media, Vanuatu, ",2020-10-24T19:22:23+00:00

He was re-elected as the MP for the Pentecost Constituency — a seat he had held since 2002.In October 2015, Vanuatu's then-deputy prime minister Moana Carcasses was jailed for four years for bribery and corruption, putting him behind bars with 13 other MPs — or half of the nation's government.The Supreme Court found Carcasses had made illegal payments amounting to 35 million Vatu ($452,000) to his fellow MPs when they were in opposition.Justice Mary Sey ruled that the payments were designed to influence MPs in their capacity as public officials.The Parliament's speaker had tried unsuccessfully to pardon himself and the convicted MPs, including another former prime minister Serge Vohor, ahead of the sentencing.In 2018, former prime minister Joe Natuman was given a suspended two-year jail sentence after pleading guilty to conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.","Government and Politics, Law, Crime and Justice, Laws, Pacific, Vanuatu, ",2021-02-03T02:41:49+00:00

Workers like Ms Felix earn up to $25 an hour on Australian farms — about nine times the $2.70 minimum wage in Vanuatu.And like many other Pacific seasonal workers, Ms Felix relies on income from the seasonal worker program to pay for her children's school fees.Other workers have used the money to pay for their own education, family wedding ceremonies or to invest in new businesses in Vanuatu.Ms Felix believes the timing could not be better.Sales from her fruit and vegetable stall in Vanuatu's capital Port Vila were suffering, a downturn she blamed on the COVID-19 crisis.""Vanuatu has laid off many people in their permanent jobs, so there [are] no jobs for everyone to pay for their families,"" Ms Felix said.She said this trial in Australia was a chance for her to ""help things come back"" and complete her vision — to start an agricultural business in her village.But the decision was not easy, and Ms Felix said she really misses her 13-year-old daughter, who is being looked after by her grandmother.""They know why I'm here so I hope they understand and I'm looking forward to going back home and seeing them,"" Ms Felix said.Ms Felix is one of 162 participants in the Federal Government's pilot seasonal worker program.The program aims to get Pacific seasonal workers back on Australian farms during the coronavirus pandemic.After spending 14 days in hotel quarantine, last week Ms Felix and the other Ni-Vanuatu men and women started work on the farms in rural NT.Their job can be gruelling. The workers can spend hours in the hot sun, stripping trees of mangoes.Other workers in the packhouse fill hundreds of trays with the fruit, ready to be shipped to supermarkets around Australia.They are helping to fill a labour shortage on Australian farms and are expected to be in the country for at least nine months.Vanuatu is one of a few countries that have no confirmed cases of coronavirus, and some workers are concerned they may become infected while working in Australia.""We're happy to come, but we're scared also,"" said Royson Watas, a worker from Vanuatu's northern island of Santo.""We don't know what's going to happen out there.""Mr Watas said he did have second thoughts about leaving his family and fishing business during the pandemic.He was particularly concerned about being able to return to Vanuatu after his contract ends.Some seasonal workers have been stuck in Australia with no job and no way to leave the country after border restrictions were put in place by the Vanuatu Government in March. But Mr Watas said the risk of contracting coronavirus was low since the Northern Territory has no active cases of COVID-19, and he feels comfortable about working on the farm.His employer, mango farmer Barry Albrecht, said he is also glad to have the Pacific labourers back. ""It costs us to bring them in, with quarantine fees and all that. But we feel they're worth it,"" Mr Albrecht said.""They're so easy to get along with: polite, well-mannered, clean.""The Northern Territory Farmers Association has said it hopes more Vanuatu workers will be able to follow this first cohort, to help with the harvest season.Other states are also considering creating similar programs, to allow workers from Pacific countries with no confirmed cases of coronavirus to work on Australian farms.The peak body Fruit Growers Tasmania has said it was watching the outcomes of the Northern Territory trial and considering development of a travel bubble with Pacific countries.""That's really, really good news for us in Vanuatu and people who earn a low income,"" Mr Watas said.Lester David from Port Vila was also hoping the pilot seasonal worker program would be expanded.The 36-year-old bus driver has been told he is on a list of workers that will join the others in Northern Territory once a second flight is approved by the Australian and Vanuatu governments.Like many of the other workers now in Australia, Mr David has worked on Northern Territory's mango farms before, and used the money he earned to pay for two weddings in his family and to buy a bus for his business.He hopes by returning to work in Australia, he can earn enough money to finish building his house, pay for his wedding and pay for a course in accounting management.Mr David has wondered why Australians were not doing these farm jobs instead of men and women from Vanuatu.But he believes the answer is simple.""Are Australians willing to work these jobs?"" he said.""I've got big plans in front of me so I'm willing to work hard towards achieving it.""The Vanuatu Prime Minister's Office said Australian and Vanuatu officials have been discussing the possibility of sending more workers to Northern Territory mango farms.","Agricultural Crops, Agriculture, Australia, Fruit, NT, Rural, Vanuatu, ",2020-09-26T20:05:39+00:00
113,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-10-15/coronavirus-pacific-economy-foriegn-aid-china/12754068,"Across the world only a handful of countries remain COVID free. Ten of them are in the Pacific. Through foresight and a bit of luck our Pacific neighbours have pulled off a miracle by walling themselves off from the outside world early, protecting their vulnerable communities and weak health systems.No amount of luck or foresight could help the Pacific avoid the economic devastation trailing in the disease's wake. Pacific economies are dependent on the outside world — be it through tourism, commodities, trade, migration or aid. COVID-19 has disrupted all these economic ties and brought ruin to Pacific economies. The numbers are eye watering. Fiji expects its economy to contract by 21.7 per cent this year. Vanuatu expects to lose two in every five of its formal sector jobs. A region-wide economic contraction of more than 10 per cent this year is on the cards.Most Pacific governments do not have the financial firepower to fight back against this economic collapse on their own. Budgets are already stretched and largely in deficit. Many countries are locked out of foreign debt markets, and those that do have access are charged crippling interest more than 10 times higher than the sub 1 per cent rates Australia enjoys.Fortunately, the Pacific countries are not in this alone, and have benefited from a resurgence of attention in recent years. Last week the Lowy Institute released the third iteration of its Pacific Aid Map, the largest and most comprehensive database of aid information ever assembled for the Pacific, which now tracks aid up to 2018.Our data shows aid in the Pacific surged in 2018 by more than 25 per cent to reach a historic US$2.89 billion, equivalent to roughly 8.5 per cent of the region's GDP. This surge, driven by every major donor in the region, aligns with the heightened geopolitical tensions in the region as Western nations become more anxious about China's growing presence in the region. While the Pacific nations may find the spotlight uncomfortable and condescending, the renewed attention has brought with it a silver lining of greater aid resourcing.One country conspicuously absent in this scale-up has been the very country creating so much anxiety. While Chinese aid to the Pacific did increase by 11 per cent in 2018 to US $242 million — largely in the form of cheap loans — preliminary analysis shows this support falling off a cliff in 2019 to $121 million. It gets worse in 2020, where the Lowy Institute has only identified $4 million in new commitments (on top of those from previous years) made to the region despite its dire economic situation.The reduction of Chinese aid to the Pacific could be for any number of reasons. It could be that China lost interest in the Pacific after Xi Jinping's rockstar appearance at the APEC Leaders' Summit in Port Moresby in late 2018. China may have decided the Pacific delivered diminishing strategic benefit thanks to the reengagement of the West and waning interest from Pacific governments. Or it may be that Chinese aid served its purpose in the Pacific, acting as the conduit by which Chinese State-Owned Enterprises could enter the Pacific markets and put down deep roots. No one in the Pacific in 2020 will tell you that the Chinese presence feels diminished. For whatever reason, China has been missing in action for the Pacific during the pandemic.The handing down of Australia's Federal Budget this week is also telling of how challenging it will be for even the most committed of partners to keep up these historic levels of aid to the region. Headline aid is maintained at $4 billion, with a two-year supplement of $300 million which the Government has acknowledged can also be considered aid. That will be a relief to many in the sector, but it is still a record low as a share of GNI. Within that allocation, to the Pacific increases to $1.44 billion. The ""Pacific Step Up"" is Scott Morrison's flagship foreign policy initiative and the Government is clearly conscious of the severe challenges facing the Pacific. But even with this focus it could only put together a minor increase, with much of the previous increases in focus on the region coming at the expense of other regions also doing it tough. Given the harsh economic realities at home and record-breaking deficits and debt, it is also not surprising.So how can donors adjust to help the Pacific weather this economic crisis?The region has been well placed by a surge in aid to record levels ahead of the crisis. There will be very little appetite for further increases as every donor faces its own economic reckoning. A lot of work will instead have to be done beneath the surface, with donors being creative and adapting to divert existing aid budgets from their long-term development objectives to short-term crisis recovery. Priorities should be around keeping services moving, plugging holes in government finances through direct budget support, and for more solvent nations using our credit rating to help restructure their debts and reduce their debt servicing burdens.Every bit of support from Australia and others, including China, will be necessary to stop a lost decade of development in the Pacific. While that support may help stem the bleeding, the only thing that will be able to stop it will be for borders to reopen between these COVID-free countries and Australia and New Zealand. For that to happen, we rely on the behaviour of every Australian, not just those sitting in the halls of Parliament.Jonathan Pryke is the Director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute and Alexandre Dayant is a research fellow in the same program.

For Dr Len Tarivonda, Vanuatu's Director of Public Health, the situation presents a unique challenge to the country's under-resourced healthcare system. He said a lack of testing kits has meant less than 10 per cent of the 2,193 recent arrivals have been tested for COVID-19.""We are doing testing only on people coming from high-risk areas, categorised by the number of active cases,"" Dr Tarivonda said.""We don't have enough test kits and also the testing capacity here [is not enough], so the decision was made to only test those who are coming from medium- to high-risk areas.""Despite the low testing rates, Dr Tarivonda said the risk of an infection spreading outside of Vanuatu's quarantine facilities remained low.The Government has introduced further restrictions on international travel as a result of the first recorded COVID-19 case. International travellers will now spend 28 days in quarantine, instead of the earlier 14, and will need to provide a negative COVID-19 test result 72 hours before their departing flight.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicMany Pacific economies rely on tourism, and have faced financial crises during the pandemic.That outlook prompted French Polynesia to open its borders to international tourists in July.Within a month, it had recorded 70 new cases of COVID-19, with bars and restaurants visited by tourists identified as hotspots for transmission.The Government soon faced public backlash for its decision; Tahiti resident Vehia Wheeler said in August ""it feels like we are disposable as a population"".But the French Territory continued to encourage people to visit, putting in place certain measures, like mandatory face masks and limits to public gatherings, as a means to limit the infection's spread.Cruise ships even resumed their travel through the archipelago.French Polynesia's Government has underscored the need to keep its economy afloat through the pandemic.""The measures taken to open the territory were necessary to support the economic and social lives of the country,"" French Ambassador for the territory, Dominique Sorain, said.More than 4 per cent of its population has now been infected with COVID-19, and as recently as Wednesday, French Polynesia recorded 345 new COVID-19 cases.French Polynesia's President Édouard Fritch tested positive to the virus last month, two days after visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.In contrast, the neighbouring French Pacific territory of New Caledonia has banned all incoming air travel, except for repatriation flights and freight, until March, 2021.It has no active COVID-19 cases and has recorded no cases of community transmission.Papua New Guinea recorded its first case of COVID-19 back in March, but its numbers have remained relatively low since then.To date, the country has confirmed fewer than 600 cases and seven deaths.Many believe that's because of PNG's low testing rates, and health authorities have urged more people to come forward if they have any COVID-19 symptoms.The World Health Organization has said it was working with PNG's health authorities to introduce a rapid test kit that would increase its testing capacity.""Exactly when that rapid testing will be available and how it will be rolled out still need to be planned more at this point of time,"" said Dr Tauhid Islam, WHO's officer in charge.PNG scientists have been trying to determine whether Papua New Guineans could be less susceptible to the virus.Tamara Koleala, a molecular scientist from PNG's Institute of Medical Research (IMR), said COVID-19 might be behaving differently in PNG than elsewhere in the world.""In PNG, in September, the National Control Centre reported that about 55 per cent of people who were infected were asymptomatic, so we're trying to find out how a person is affected by [COVID-19] and one of those reasons could be genetic,"" Dr Koleala said.Dr Koleala has recently received funding from the Australian Government to carry out a range of COVID-19 related research.Despite border closures and bans on flights, many Pacific countries rely on international shipping for the flow of goods and supplies.But three recent COVID-19 infections aboard a container ship in American Samoa have put a spotlight on the industry, and the risks it brings to the region's ports.Bekiri Sitki Ustaoglu, head of the Asia Pacific Section at the International Maritime Organization, said the Pacific can't shutdown its maritime routes. ""International shipping is the carrier of the world, if we do not take measures to let international shipping continue its services, then things will get from bad to worse,"" Mr Ustaoglu said.""As the Pacific Islands are composed of island states and archipelagos, they are very much dependent on shipping.""Pacific port authorities were further concerned earlier this month when a cargo ship that anchored off Queensland was found to be infected with a mutated COVID-19 strain.That ship, the Sofrana Surville, had passed through several Pacific countries before reaching Australia, including Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia.Paul Griffin, an Associate Professor at Queensland University who specialises in infectious diseases, said the source of the new strain could not be determined without a genomic match.But he said Pacific ports could not be ruled out as a potential source of the mutated strain.""I think certainly there would be areas in the Pacific where testing would be challenging, let alone genomic, so it's possible it originated from there,"" Dr Griffin said.","COVID-19, Disease Outbreak, French Polynesia, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Travel Health and Safety, Vanuatu, ",2020-11-12T18:40:09+00:00

Katherine mango grower, Mitchael Curtis has signed up to take around 30 of the seasonal workers from Vanuatu, but said that will not be enough for his 20,000 tree plantation.Speaking to ABC Rural, he said he has spent months trying to lock in a workforce, and is worried what another COVID-19 border closure would mean to his business.""After all of this time spent looking after the crop, growing it, irrigating it, spraying it, and then have to worry about whether anyone will be around to pick it, it keeps me awake at night,"" he said.""It's been a very hard year, I'm stressed to the max.""We've got a good crop, we've got some fantastic mangoes here … but this year might not be how much I can grow, but how much I can get into a box.""NT Farmers Association said it would continue to work with all stakeholders to deliver subsequent flights from Vanuatu, and was continuing its campaign to attract as many local workers as possible.In 2019 the Northern Territory's mango industry was valued at more than $128 million and was responsible for producing around 52 per cent of Australia's mango crop.","COVID-19, Crop Harvesting, Darwin, Farm Labour, New Zealand, Rural, Trade, Vanuatu, ",2020-09-03T00:37:26+00:00
116,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-12/what-are-the-countries-that-remain-free-of-coronavirus/12874248,"The Pacific nation of Vanuatu only this week recorded its first case of COVID-19 — joining the vast majority of the world's countries that have been affected by the virus.An asymptomatic man returned from the United States, which has recorded upwards of 10 million cases of coronavirus, before testing positive in Vanuatu's capital, Port Vila, on Tuesday.The neighbouring Solomon Islands and Marshall Islands recorded their first COVID-19 infections last month, but have not yet seen cases of community transmission.More than 50 million people worldwide have been infected with coronavirus and more than one million have lost their lives.Here's a look at the lucky countries who are still (or claim to be) COVID-free.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicThe Government of Turkmenistan claims not to have detected any COVID-19 cases at all. This is despite the fact neighbouring Iran has recorded more than 715,000 coronavirus cases to date and around 40,000 deaths.What's more, the Global Health Security Index, released by John Hopkins University in 2019, ranked Turkmenistan's health system 147th out of 156 countries in terms of preparedness to mitigate the spread of an epidemic.Turkmenistan's COVID-free status is therefore more likely a symptom of the country's repressive policies than the truth.The autocratic President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov — who gained international notoriety last year for doing doughnuts next to a flaming crater to prove he was not dead — has made sure discussion of coronavirus is heavily censored.While there have been more reported deaths from respiratory conditions in 2020 than usual, authorities have blamed dust and air pollution.Access to the country is limited, but World Health Organization (WHO) officials were permitted to travel there in July.""WHO is aware of several sources reporting alleged COVID-19 transmission in the country, and is concerned about reports of increasing acute respiratory infections and pneumonia,"" its report said.Deputy Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Rachel Denber, said in September: ""Turkmenistan's Government has prioritised the country's image over people's wellbeing.""An even more closed-off and totalitarian society than Turkmenistan, North Korea has also reported no cases of COVID-19.This is despite having a 1,420 kilometre border with its ally and closest trade partner China, where the virus was first detected and at least 92,000 cases have been recorded.Neighbouring South Korea has seen more than 27,000 infections.Experts have widely disputed that it's possible the North has no cases whatsoever.North Korea was one of the first countries to shut its borders, barring foreign tourists in January and halting all flights in and out. The Government in February indicated borders would not reopen until a cure was found. It has also mandated masks and restricted public gatherings.In July, it looked as though the North's first case had emerged after somebody crossed the border from South Korea and authorities have repeatedly shut down the border city of Kaesong.But a WHO situation report from North Korea from October 29 said there had been zero cases reported from 10,462 tests conducted — a very low number for a country of more than 25 million.However, some 5,368 people were suspected COVID patients, the WHO said.With their relatively weak healthcare systems, a number of Pacific nations have enforced strict limitations on who is allowed to cross their borders since the pandemic began.As a result, Nauru, Tonga, Kiribati, Micronesia, Palau, Samoa and Tuvalu are the remaining countries not to have reported any COVID cases.The WHO has reported 18,337 cases across the entire Pacific since the pandemic began — fewer than in the state of Victoria.While Pacific nations' geography makes them vulnerable to climate change, it is a unique advantage in a deadly pandemic. Their isolation has made shutting off borders to the rest of the world relatively easy.For example, even after Vanuatu was struck by a major cyclone in April, it did not allow foreign aid workers to disembark for response efforts.Nevertheless, it has taken a toll on their largely tourism-dependent economies.A new report by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) this week warned of an impending food crisis in the Pacific caused by the pandemic.""Food systems were already under pressure. COVID-19 has exposed and exacerbated those pressures,"" said ACIAR CEO Professor Andrew Campbell.""The pandemic is threatening to morph from a health crisis to a food crisis. Women and girls are among the most severely affected groups, and the most at risk from worsening food security.""Australia has boosted its economic support to the region, with the Morrison Government allocating more than $300 million in the Budget to provide economic assistance to recover from the pandemic.The Government pledged a further $500 million late last month to ensure a ""fast, safe vaccine rollout in the Pacific and South-East Asia"".","COVID-19, Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of, Nauru, Pacific, Tonga, Turkmenistan, Vanuatu, ",2020-11-12T02:06:26+00:00

Mr Wahe said the event also serves to establish who is the villages' paramount chief, or yeremwanu.""The yeremwanu is the biggest chief, a bit like a king, and we identify him through a Nekowiar ceremony,"" he said.Clans on the island of Tanna have their own chiefly governance systems and each person within the clan has a specific activity to fulfil and outfits that they wear, during the ceremony.""The Nekowiar shows everyone who is chief. He's the one who wears the long feather of the bird that comes out in the early morning,"" Mr Wahe said.As a major cultural reunion event, the Nekowiar also provides an opportunity to arrange marriages between boys and girls from different villages across the island.""If a boy likes a girl and wants to bring her home, he doesn't have to pay [a bride price] for her, like we usually do on Tanna. If he finds her during the Nekowiar, then it's free,"" Pricilla Noel said.She said Nekowiar also allows men and women to spend time together without having to follow the island's other customary protocols.""If they are dancing and a boy or a girl trespasses into the dance and grabs a hold of them, then they can take the dancer for themselves. The customary dance makes everything allowed,"" Ms Noel said.The event had previously been described by some tour operators as permitting ""consenting adults … to indulge in their sexual pursuits"".Mr Wahe said that while adultery does happen during Nekowiar, it isn't the event's objective.""It's not true. If you commit adultery or anything else, the Nekowiar washes that away, because it's a time for forgiveness and reconciliation,"" Mr Wahe said.""But it's not a time where you simply do something bad because it's Nekowiar.""But he said the pig killing ceremony that marks an end of festivities does play an important role.""Once the pigs are killed, you can't do anything bad anymore,"" Mr Wahe said.""The blood of the pig washes us of the wrongs we may have committed.""","Carnivals and Festivals, Community and Multicultural Festivals, Community and Society, Dance, Indigenous (Other Peoples), Pacific, Vanuatu, ",2020-09-19T19:16:30+00:00

I claim myself as a self-taught, although I was given the tools and the knowledge from my family,"" he said.""I was quite fascinated with island styles — Carol N Mark, Tiki Togs from Fiji. I took major inspiration from massive fashion names like Pilioko, from Vanuatu.""Mr Tamasese broke into the fashion scene in 2013, but his Samoan label Petelo Enele was too challenging for clients to pronounce.""It was hard to remember, so if someone asked 'Who are you wearing?' and they can't pronounce it. The word of mouth doesn't exist,"" he said.The brand's English equivalent, Peter Henry, was born and was later invited to showcase at the Global Indigenous Fashion Runway, Pacific International Runway, and New York Fashion week in 2017.Mr Tamasese's mother and aunts all wore kaftans, but he was fascinated most by the various ways they could be accessorised.""I looked at the Aussie ladies — they were absolutely glamorous in a kaftan and that was it, I was hooked. I began using my background in upeti art,"" he said.""It's simple, it's elegant, it's glamorous, and I love what the girls over here can do with it, the way they tie it. You won't even know it's a kaftan.""Mr Tamasese uses the upeti to create the motif outline, before adding layers of colour and embellishments to the dresses, revitalising an historical art form.""I draw inspiration from Camilla, the goddess of kaftans, and I like to utilise a little bit of Pacific light colours and Australia's earth colours,"" he said.Mr Tamasese maintains a loyal clientele in the Asia Pacific, Europe and American Samoa.""Samoans say 'I rocked up and I was the only one wearing this'. It's an amazing feeling because that shows your work is being appreciated,"" he said.But the designer's colour blindness means no two Peter Henry kaftans are the same, because he can't remember the colours he uses on each piece.""I never knew I was colour blind until once I said, 'Oh, that's a nice blue. It was purple,"" he said.""I think it's good in a way because I don't mass produce and whatever I have is what you get.""It makes it more one-off, one of a kind. I like it, it stands out.""Mr Tamasese's design process is a lot less orthodox as he incorporates nature's elements from the front yard of his Gold Coast home.""If I paint it in the garage or house, overnight the colour doesn't appear. But if I paint in the sun it dries and flattens the design,"" he said.""If I want to splash some paint on it, I hold the brush to the air and let the wind blow the colour onto it.""Sometimes I have my magpie friend stop by and say, 'Girl, do you have some bread around the house we can have?', and sometimes I get the odd honeybees because, with my hat, they think it's a beehive.""Mr Tamasese uses a special paintbrush, affectionately known as Fatima, that was given by a good friend who died from cancer in 2013.Fatima has been by his side ever since.""She is my favourite brush, but regardless of how you hold the brush, sometimes she has a mind of her own,"" he said.""I'll paint it and then say, 'Oh, no, I've done it the wrong way', and it's her fault. But my God she works wonders when she's happy.""In the cut-throat world of fashion, emerging designers jostle for opportunities to show off their creations, but Mr Tamasese said there were ""tonnes"" of shows for Indigenous and ethnic designers.""With our art, people ask, 'Where did that come from?', and if you go abroad it identifies the country you are from.

""I have an older brother who also had to go through exactly what I have been through, and all of my cousins as well,"" she said. At school, classmates often questioned her identity.Ms Warcon found the answers through her grandmother, Daphne Florence Warcon nee Malamoo.The 87-year-old, known affectionately as Mama to Rachel and her family, died in February 2020.""She taught us who we are and that we are strong Australian South Sea Islander people — being proud of who you are and not being ashamed of where you come from,"" Ms Warcon said.""She connected us back to our culture, she played a very big role in it, and hopefully I can always do her proud and keep that running through our family.""Her father William Warcon, known as Scott, also helped by sharing his knowledge with his family.""He talked to us about it all. Even going back over to Vanuatu they tell you the stories of how it all happened,"" she said.""I've been on the beach where my great-grandad was kidnapped. It was a pretty special moment.""[Family members] explain to you and they put it in perspective of how lucky we have it now and how much they had to sacrifice for us to be here.""

Seasonal workers from Pacific Island nations have been working on the mainland since the last Tasmanian harvest finished when they found they could not return home due to international travel restrictions.In the midday meeting on Monday, the State Government told Fruit Growers Tasmania chief executive Peter Cornish they would work with them to get workers both from the mainland and overseas.""We're not trying to circumvent any health requirements. We want to work with the Government,"" Mr Cornish said.""We've got a significant number of people who the growers here are the primary sponsors for, and so they've got obligations under the schemes to these people.""They've worked here earlier in the year most of them, and now they are looking to bring them back for this harvest.""Last month the State Government announced a $1.9 million campaign to get unemployed Tasmanians to fill the 8,000 jobs needed by the fruit industry.Primary Industries Minister Guy Barnett said he wanted to make sure the fruit would be harvested.""A local agricultural jobs campaign will kick off in coming weeks encouraging Tasmanians to consider new career options to help meet immediate labour needs in the industry,"" he said.Mr Barnett also said that the Government was working on contingency plans to ensure there would be a harvest-ready workforce to address labour gaps.""This includes public health officials working to determine how the movement of agricultural workers can be facilitated,"" he said.The Pacific Island workers on the mainland are mainly located in 'COVID-safe' states according to Mr Cornish, who indicated some could be in Tasmania by the end of the month.Mr Cornish also said the Tasmanian Government had committed to looking at a travel bubble with Pacific Island countries.Subscribe to Rural RoundUp: Stories from rural and regional Australia, every Friday.""Only last week we had the trial of Vanuatu workers going into the NT with mangoes, so we'll be looking to see how that trial goes,"" he said.""We have to start work now if we can get the overseas workers in before the end of the year.

Those men and women were expecting to board a chartered flight to Darwin next Tuesday.The Federal Government has been spruiking the plan as a solution to labour shortages in the Territory, and mango farmers have warned they will not be able to harvest this season's crop without workers from overseas.But a spokesman for the Prime Minister of Vanuatu Bob Loughman told the ABC that the scheme may not proceed, saying some Vanuatu government ministers wanted to instead focus on repatriating their own citizens who are currently overseas.""The Government of Vanuatu through its Council of Ministers has not, at this stage, made a decision to give a green light for the sending of the seasonal workers to Darwin early next week,"" he said.""[The council] is dominantly against the plan, arguing that all the efforts are now placed with the Repatriation Plan which is rolling out again next week.""A final decision is expected early next week.

It's early, but already groups of workers are bustling around a farm.Standing over a conveyor belt with large orange sweet potatoes gently tumbling past is a woman from Vanuatu.Stephanie Nakuramu has spent three seasons at the McCrystal sweet potato farm and nursery, usually returning home to her village near Port Vila around May or June. This year is very different.It's nearly been a year since Ms Nakuramu has seen her nine and seven-year-old daughters. She misses them dearly and has no idea when she will be able to see them again.""We are stuck here because of the COVID,"" she said.""We are hoping to go back in March, but it is depending on the borders.""I see them on Facetime, but I miss them a lot.""The seasonal farm work completed by Ms Nakuramu helps provide income for education and an improved quality of life for her children as they stay with her parents on the island, but you can see the anguish on her face as she talks about her girls.Knowing she is providing for her family is not the only thing that helps her stay strong in this confusing and frustrating time, it's also the knowledge she is helping Australians from going hungry.""I feel what we are doing here, it's a big role,"" she said.""What we are doing here is we are feeding other people that are locked down and there's no work and we are providing food for them.""That's a big thing.""Focusing on other positive aspects of the situation also helps Ms Nakuramu deal with the confusion and pain of not knowing when she will see her children, like knowing she has an income while many in Vanuatu are struggling.""It's frustrating but we are earning money and that's a pretty good thing and we are happy about that,"" she said.""Lots of our families, they don't get too much work.

All that's been disrupted.""The only positive is they can still find employment and send money home.""Caring for the emotional wellbeing of the seasonal workers has also been a priority for Mr McCrystal as he deals with homesickness and concerns from the workers' families back home.""You can see homesickness setting in and you can see they miss home,"" he said.""They have loved ones who are anxious for them out here, thinking Australia is potentially dangerous because of COVID, so they are constantly trying to reassure them we are safe from COVID, we have systems in place to manage it.""They are settling in and we are just trying to navigate this journey together.""Many of the workers from Vanuatu on the McCrystal farm have spent a few seasons in Bundaberg. They feel comfort from the fact that, in many ways, it feels like a home away from home.Cultural differences and language still remain a barrier and, as much as workers value the role they play in food production for Australia, missing the ones they love is still front of mind.Able George has two children at home in his village near Port Vila in Vanuatu.

Thousands gathered last Thursday, July 23, for a Victory Parade, marching through Port Vila to kick off the anniversary, building toward Independence Day on July 30.For four-and-a-half hours people marched, singing and dancing, from the Tagabe area to Independence Park, marking the beginning of the holiday period.Vanuatu was previously governed under the joint control of Britain and France, and then known as New Hebrides.

We hope it could be a shortfall of 1,000 people we could bring in if required.""Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicThe Opposition's employment spokesman Brendan O'Connor questioned how the pilot would unfold.""Federal Labor supports the seasonal worker program, however the questions that need to be asked include: is there a legitimate local labour supply, and if not, is it safe for people to travel, and will they avoid the exploitation which has previously been reported under this scheme?"" he said.When borders closed to international travellers earlier this year, there were 140,000 backpackers and more than 7000 Pacific Islanders with working visas in the country.The Federal Government extended the visas for those seasonal workers in country, but farmers say it is not enough to see them through the spring and summer harvest.It is not just the horticulture sector concerned about access to workers — the wool industry fears it will not have access to overseas shearers, prompting animal welfare concerns if sheep are left to wait to be shorn.The Shearing Contractors Association of Australia said the local industry typically relied on 480 shearers from New Zealand to sheer about 5 million sheep.Based on the current travel restrictions, the association said that could mean up to 8 per cent of the national flock may not be shorn in a timely manner.West Australian grain farmers have warned the State Government their industry could have a shortfall of 500 header drivers, plus an additional 1,000 unskilled workers.WAFarmers grains president Mic Fels said farmers were ""freaking out a little bit"" about who was going to get the crop off later this year.""Conservatively, we're talking in excess of 500 skilled header drivers as a shortfall for this coming harvest and the consequences if we can't work it out is delayed harvest but also serious OH&S concerns,"" Mr Fels said.Earlier this week, Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said the Government was working on new measures to meet the labour shortage, saying ""there's a real aversion from the Australian workforce to go and pick fruit"".","Agribusiness, Agricultural Crops, Australia, COVID-19, Community and Society, Darwin, Federal Government, Government and Politics, Health, Infectious Diseases (Other), Katherine, Respiratory Diseases, Rural, Vanuatu, ",2020-07-30T19:01:26+00:00

New Zealand first eliminated community transmission of the virus by imposing a strict lockdown in late March when only about 100 people had tested positive for the disease.Some prominent local health experts suggested it was more likely the virus had been quietly spreading in Auckland for weeks, despite efforts to eradicate it with an initial five-week hard lockdown.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the latest outbreak appeared to be a new strain, which may suggest NZ was successful in its first eradication and the virus had now been reintroduced.""The sequence of the virus from the current outbreak is not the same as the sequences from community cases in our first original outbreak in New Zealand.""In other words, not from a dormant community transmission from the beginning of the pandemic.""Since the return of new infections, New Zealand has reimposed tight restrictions and authorities expect case numbers to climb in the coming days.But the country will stick with its initial approach as it tries to drive case numbers back to zero.""Going hard and early is still the best course of action,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.On Friday, she said it was better to look at an outbreak situation with restrictions put in place early.This was in contrast with locations like Hong Kong and Australia.""Better to assess the situation with restrictions in place,"" Ms Ardern said.Mr Bowtell agreed and commended Ms Ardern's plan.Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicHe said coronavirus would never be eradicated but eliminating transmission with strict quarantine and isolation measures was the best way to fight the pandemic.""When a case of coronavirus turns up, probably through problems with quarantine and isolation, you move as swiftly as possible and you clobber those cases,"" he said.""Then you go back to cautious business as usual.""He also cautioned against taking an approach more like those seen in the US or Brazil, where economic concerns have prevailed over public health measures.""That would be a recipe for one of the biggest disasters in human history,"" he said.In Australia, there has been substantial opposition to the elimination strategy from both business and government.The Prime Minister has said that level of restrictions would double the unemployment rate and the strategy itself was risky.New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said eradicating the virus in Australia was unrealistic and powerful business groups have argued trying to completely stamp it out was unachievable and would be too destructive to the economy.Mr Bowtell, however, strongly advocates the kinds of measures seen in New Zealand and thinks Australia should follow their goal of eliminating community transmission.""There seemed to be decisions made by the Federal and Victorian governments that they would not learn from and adopt what was going on next door in New Zealand and even closer to home in Queensland and Western Australia,"" he said.""I don't think the strategies adopted by those two governments have worked out very well.""We would have been much better off to have adopted the New Zealand approach in the first place.""In June, NSW, which had been the worst-affected state in Australia before Victoria's second wave, had three weeks without community transmission, and Mr Bowtell said that was a good target to aim for.That could again be achieved by shifting to stricter lockdowns, like in New Zealand.""It's like extinguishing the embers of a bushfire. It's better than waiting until the flames are 10 metres high,"" Mr Bowtell said.""It is better than dealing with hundreds of new cases a day.""","Australia, COVID-19, Diseases and Disorders, Government and Politics, Health, Nauru, New Zealand, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2020-08-15T19:20:26+00:00

But some critics say the funds could have been better used to develop Pacific broadcasting capabilities, strengthen independent journalism in the region or showcase content more relevant to Pacific audiences. Broadcasters in Papua New Guinea welcomed the move, saying they had been consulted and had chosen content they thought would suit their audiences. But they also hoped Pacific content would be beamed onto Australian TVs.""I'm sure there are a lot of happy people around PNG today,"" Sheena Hughes, acting CEO of EMTV, said after The Voice premiered last night.

But he would also like to see money funnelled into local productions. ""While initially we are happy to welcome this content on our televisions, for us, down the line, we would encourage some arrangement where our technical and production staff can feed off their counterparts in Australia,"" he said. ""So that we cannot only learn from them but also … in the longer term we can have some PNG content on Australian screens as well.""Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Fiji will be the first broadcast shows, including Neighbours, MasterChef, The Voice, 60 Minutes, House Rules, Border Security: Australia's Frontline and children's program Totally Wild on free-to-air channels, under the initiative delivered by Free TV Australia.In the coming months, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Nauru will follow.Ms Hughes added her station was hoping to be able to broadcast the NRL, as it had in the past. Nine Entertainment pays $115 million for NRL broadcast rights. ""We believe strongly any sporting program should be able to be broadcasted to Papua New Guineans nationwide,"" she said. Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister, Marise Payne, said Free TV Australia was finalising arrangements for sports like netball, cricket, soccer, AFL and NRL to be broadcast.Ms Hughes added the initiative ""couldn't have come at a better time,"" as the COVID-19 pandemic impacted on advertising and businesses. Some have viewed the initiative as flexing some 'soft power' muscle to counter China's growing influence in the region.The ABC's Radio Australia switched off shortwave transmissions across the Pacific in January of 2017.About 18 months later, China's state-owned broadcaster China Radio International took over the radio frequencies.ABC Radio Australia continues to broadcast on FM to urban populations in the Pacific, and the ABC still runs an international TV service in the region.Last year, two Pacific countries — Solomon Islands and Kiribati — switched their diplomatic allegiances from Taiwan to China.Graeme Smith, an expert on China and the Pacific at the Australian National University, said Australia and China had two different approaches to soft power.He said China's focus tended to be about controlling the way ""the China story is told"", and that it tended to promote aspects of its culture, like martial arts, traditional medicine and anything related to ""ancient Chinese wisdom"". ""Neighbours doesn't count as ancient Chinese wisdom … or any sort of wisdom really,"" he said.Dr Smith said the initiative was ""trying to promote Australian values"", but that a lack of diversity might fail to represent Pacific viewers.""Australian commercial television tends to be very white, but what people like to see on the screen is themselves … it's unlikely to feature too many strong Pacific island characters in the mix,"" he said.He said a better strategy might be to emulate projects like Love Patrol, a Vanuatu drama supported by Australian aid, which he described as a ""huge soft power win"". ""If they're looking to have more influence, soft-power-wise, in the Pacific, they should be looking to support local content production, rather than expecting people to watch Neighbours and relate to it,"" he said.Minister for International Development and the Pacific Alex Hawke said the ""PacificAus TV initiative is a terrific demonstration of shared cultural ties and links between Australia and the Pacific"", while Senator Payne said ""having the opportunity to watch the same stories on our screens will only deepen the connection with our Pacific family"".

Seemingly in response to this, Fiji is about to start a trial of its own version of the coronavirus tracing app.Mr Sayed-Khaiyum said the country is ""feeling good"" about how it has responded to the coronavirus, through contact-tracing and lockdowns.It has recorded 18 cases of COVID-19, but no new cases in the past four weeks.But its testing rate is still well below Australia and New Zealand, and there are some early concerns about how effective the app will be in the country.The numbers of COVID-19 cases have been equally steady in most Pacific Island countries, but there is a push to increase antibody testing in the region to ensure cases aren't being missed.Australia, New Zealand and the World Health Organisation are currently delivering almost 100 000 GeneXpert testing cartridges to Pacific Island countries.Pacific countries have experienced devastation from introduced diseases in the past, most recently when measles killed more than 80 people in Samoa.In the face of their vulnerabilities, most acted quickly to protect themselves from COVID-19 and they'll be careful not to jeopardise that now.While Fiji has been the most forthcoming about wanting to be included in the ""travel bubble,"" other countries across the region have had different reactions.Vanuatu has confirmed it has had talks with Australia about the idea.While its economy is also heavily reliant on tourism, it has been incredibly cautious about reopening its borders given it has not recorded any cases of COVID-19 so far.The Cook Islands, another tourism dependent economy, has expressed interest in reopening borders.Other Pacific Island countries that haven't recorded any cases, especially those with smaller tourism industries, have also expressed some hesitation.But a Pacific bubble is about more than just providing beaches for Australians and New Zealanders to sun themselves on.It could provide new trade opportunities in the region and reopen travel for Pacific workers who visit Australia and New Zealand under specific labour schemes.Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape said he had held discussions with his Australian counterpart about the travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand.""We're sensitive to those discussions, but Mr Morrison has told me they kept Pacific Islands out of discussions simply because most have almost nil presence of COVID-19,"" he said.PNG's borders will remain closed until at least the start of June, but its national airline has continued flying to Australia throughout the lockdown period, to collect freight.Mr Marpae said he told Mr Morrison PNG is developing a ""protocol on international travel"".The Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forums, Dame Meg Taylor, said several Pacific countries had approached New Zealand and Australia about being included in the bubble.She told an Asia Society Policy Institute event that while everyone wants to see things reopen, it will ""take time"" and the first priority ""is that people stay healthy"".""We just don't have strong health systems, health services and health infrastructure,"" Dame Meg said.""If you're going to open up, you've got to have some kind of security there so that anyone coming into your country, and your citizens as well, feel secure enough that they will be taken care of if there is a case that comes into the country.""Tourism is the country's biggest industry, bringing in about $1.37 billion ($2 billion Fijian) and accounting for 35 per cent of GDP, and Australians and New Zealanders account for about 75 per cent of Fiji's tourists.But no-one has been coming to the country since it closed its borders at the end of March, to protect against the coronavirus.As a result, as many as 100,000 people are thought to have lost work in Fiji and there are growing concerns about the wellbeing of workers who have been laid off.Tony Whitton — managing director of the Rosie Travel Group, which operates two resorts — said he had to stand down 600 workers without pay because the business has no income coming in.""It's been the most heartbreaking aspect of our business — our business has been in operation since 1974, this is the first time that we've had to initiate a furlough,"" he said.In the midst of the coronavirus lockdown, Fiji was also hit by Cyclone Harold, and the economic impact will likely see a recession, or possibly even a depression.Mr Whitton said the sooner tourists can safely start returning, the better.""The greatest aid that Australia and New Zealand can give us at this time is the tourism dollar,"" he said.","Australia, Business, Economics and Finance, COVID-19, Community and Society, Diseases and Disorders, Fiji, Lifestyle and Leisure, Papua New Guinea, Travel and Tourism (Lifestyle and Leisure), Vanuatu, ",2020-05-19T22:03:56+00:00

And that story is still unfolding,"" Mr Wood told the ABC.A game of marbles was also found as well as fire bricks suggesting some sort of a kiln or bakery may have been built into the embankment at some point.The other major site was the US military Luganville Seaplane Base that was known to the museum team as being ""somewhere in that location"", but its exact layout had been unclear.""The cyclone eroded the beach line and exposed certain reference points that actually now make the picture really clear,"" Mr Wood said.""Now we have a reference point to the photographs that we have.""One key find was a runway that ran from the water to the beach and was used to bring seaplanes on to land for refuelling and maintenance.The matting that acted as a ramp or runway had been buried in the sand and covered further by trees that grew over the location.The storm uprooted the trees and exposed the site.Exhaust manifolds and exhaust suppresses for the American sea planes were also found, along with an ""aircraft float marker"".After some investigation, Mr Wood said this had been used ""to locate aircraft and downed pilots during the war"" by the Australian, New Zealand and US air forces.""They dropped these out of the plane and they would let off a smoke signal as well as light signal at night,"" he said, adding that the finds have helped ""put pieces of the military puzzle together"".""It's really interesting the sort of little untold stories that are coming back to life because of … these artefacts.""While teams do carry out excavations, Mr Wood said the cyclone certainly sped things up by digging out the bank, washing the artefacts and spreading them out on the beach.""It certainly does require more investigation,"" Mr Wood said.""I was actually only there for a small period of time, but there's certainly a lot more things to be found.""The discoveries will be on display as part of the South Pacific World War II Museum collection when it reopens after coronavirus restrictions are lifted.","Archaeology, Asia, History, Pacific, Unrest, Conflict and War, Vanuatu, World War 2, ",2020-05-07T03:36:44+00:00

I really wanted to go back home when I [saw] my pay slip,"" he said.Like many of the workers here Mr Tuitakali has left his family behind, all for the chance to send money home. ""My wife's name is Apolonia and my daughter's name is Deborah,"" he said, as he clutched a picture of his young family.Mr Tuitakali won't see them for a year or even longer, depending on how long it takes him to earn enough leave for a visit home.Workers under the Pacific Labour Scheme can stay for up to three years. Those are three years of his daughter's life he'll mostly miss.""It makes me very, very sad,"" he said, glancing down from the picture.The Pacific Labour Scheme is run by the Department of Foreign Affairs and is intended to provide a much-needed economic boost to island nations in the Pacific.About 12,000 workers came to Australia from Pacific nations in 2019 — most on the much larger Seasonal Worker Programme.About 1,000 workers are currently in Australia on the Pacific Labour Scheme, according to Government statistics.Workers sign a contract with a labour hire company appointed by the scheme, and then they are placed with employers in Australia. The workers in Inverell are all under contract with labour hire company Meat Processors, which is part of the Food Industry People Group based in Brisbane.The company said deductions were reduced and suspended during the COVID slowdown.Food Industry People Group CFO Darren Basford told the ABC that continued deductions were likely a payroll error that would have been back-paid after a few days.""There were some errors. That's not acceptable,"" he said.Some workers did later receive $150 after they complained.Benneth Taribiti, who has a wife and three children in Vanuatu, has pay slips that show he took home $47 from his gross pay of $506 for one three-day work week.""I feel really sorry for my family,"" he said. ""I did have second thoughts of going back home.""The company said it lobbied for JobKeeper payments for workers in the scheme but it wasn't successful.The company also said the houses it rented for the workers did not surpass approved occupancy, and the accommodation fee deducted from their pay included furniture and all utilities. Mr Taribiti, who lives with eight other people in a six-bedroom house, has been concerned for his safety during the pandemic.""If we have our own room, we can keep distancing from each other, like 1.5 [metre] distancing,"" he said.""But sharing a room ... we're just mingling around together. And it's not really safe for us.""On its website, the Pacific Labour Scheme states ""all participating workers have the same rights and protections as Australian workers"".It also says it will provide support for workers to access affordable accommodation and appropriate living arrangements.""The Pacific Labour Scheme … has an in-built pastoral care support function that's responsible for helping to ensure worker welfare,"" said Holly Lawton, a research officer working on Pacific labour mobility at the Australian National University.The Pacific Labour Facility — the federal body responsible for the scheme — has case workers that are supposed to help resolve any disagreements.But ultimately, the labour hire companies have the final say.""The employment contract at the end of the day is between the employee and the employer,"" Ms Lawton said.Darren Basford from Food Industry People Group told the ABC that workers who raised concerns would not be punished.""The wellbeing of these [workers] is paramount,"" he said.A member of the Pacific Islander community in Inverell contacted the Pacific Labour Facility about the workers' concerns.In response, a case worker wrote that their reduced hours had already been explained.""In terms of the reduced work hours for Bindaree, the workers have been explained about this from [another Food Industry People Group company] RWM and their site supervisor, as well as what options they have,"" the email said.The case worker also stated workers had options to choose other accommodation with a notice period.Ellen George, from Vanuatu, is one of those who shares a house with Mr Taribiti and seven others, who all pay $150 a week.She said when they complained to Meat Processors that their accommodation charges were too high, they were told they could move — but only if they gave one year's notice.Meat Processors said the hundreds of dollars difference in the rental price paid by the Pacific Islanders and the going rate was going to the landlord, or the agent. Ms George is also confused about other deductions on her pay slip. There's no indication of total amounts or when deductions will end.""The problem is I don't really know how much I owe the company and how long it will take for all these deductions [to come out],"" she said.""With this amount of rent that I'm paying, I don't think it's fair and I do regret coming here.""I just want to go home.""","Community and Society, Fiji, Immigration, Immigration Policy, Inverell, NSW, Samoa, Vanuatu, Work, ",2020-06-10T20:05:13+00:00

Which is kind of ridiculous,"" she said.Ms Karae paid for accommodation in Brisbane for 28 days after her flight was cancelled, self-isolating as per Australia's guidelines for international visitors.She then went to stay with relatives in the regional city of Toowoomba to save money.""They told us we'd have repatriation flights back after the first state of emergency. So it didn't make sense for me to move all the way out of Brisbane,"" she said.""But then Vanuatu implemented another state of emergency … and they didn't tell us for how long, which is hard because we were renewing hotel stays week-by-week or day-by-day, which is really expensive.""Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemicThough she said she was grateful to stay with family while in Australia, she was still desperate to return home.""The thing with Vanuatu is we have low wage rates, so we have to dig deep into our pockets and our family have to dig deep into their pockets,"" Ms Karae said.""Which is difficult for them to support themselves and at the same time support us.""George Malas visited Brisbane with his family for a friend's wedding five weeks ago. They haven't been able to leave since.""We thought [the Vanuatu Government] were going to send out another repatriation flight, but they never [did],"" he said.""We didn't have an opportunity to get on the first because it was full,"" he told the ABC.Mr Malas said up to 200 other ni-Vanuatu citizens like him were waiting for a flight back home from Australia.Vanuatu is just one of several Pacific countries that have closed their borders due to the coronavirus pandemic.Some governments have arranged for repatriation flights to bring back those stuck abroad. New Zealand arranged a repatriation flight for some of its citizens stuck in Samoa last Friday.The ABC understands no such flights have been organised between Pacific governments and Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs.Mr Malas has been staying with his Australian in-laws in Brisbane for the past month.He told the ABC the situation was taking a toll on his family back home who relied on him as the eldest member of his family.Mr Malas' father died last year, leaving him as the main breadwinner for his mother and younger siblings who did not work. He said he was worried his family were running out of food.""It's really hard to leave my family back at home, [there's] no-one to help,"" he said.But Mr Malas said he was faring better than many others who did not have family in Australia to support them.Others in the same situation were facing homelessness as they struggled to pay for mounting food and accommodation costs, he said.""When I spoke to other [Vanuatu] citizens here, they say [they] don't have any money … because [they] just saved enough for when [they] thought they'd be here,"" he said.Vanuatu's National Disaster Office told local media the Government was providing assistance and that it ""will meet costs"" of those stranded abroad.The ABC contacted Vanuatu's High Commission in Australia for clarification, however had not received a response at time of publication.Papua New Guinean Clara Jajar, who is currently living with her daughter-in-law in Perth, told the ABC she feared facing legal punishment if she were to overstay her visa.""I must go back to PNG, because the visa says you must go back.

But phone lines that were cut as the storm made its way through on Monday and Tuesday are still down, making it difficult to ascertain the extent of the destruction.Initial aerial surveillance flights over the worst-affected islands on Tuesday afternoon have shown countless houses and other buildings like churches that have lost roofs, while coconut trees have been downed and food crops flattened.The ABC has been told the situation is ""grim"" with fears the damage in some places has been as bad as Cyclone Pam, which hit Vanuatu in March 2015, killing at least 15 people and leaving the country with a damage bill of nearly $600 million, more than half of the country's annual GDP.Lisa Faerua, the country director for the NGO Oxfam, told the ABC's Pacific Beat she expected the recovery would take more than a year.Ms Faerua said she expected it would be made worse by the economic damage the small Pacific island was set to face because of the coronavirus pandemic.Vanuatu has already closed its international borders, shutting out valuable tourists and cruise ships, with estimates as many as 40 per cent of people would lose their jobs in the tourism sector as a result.""It will take time. Recovery will take probably up to six to 12 months,"" Ms Faerua said.""But what is emerging at the moment for the needs of the people of Vanuatu, it's the economic livelihoods.

There are also reports of flash flooding in low-lying areas — all this while the country tries to contain its outbreak of coronavirus.With 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country, two cities — including the capital Suva — were in lockdown.Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said special COVID-19 measures were in place for evacuees.""We have contingency plans in place to prevent any mixing between evacuees and Fijians who are close contacts of existing COVID-positive patients,"" Mr Bainimarama said.""So you should have no hesitation in evacuating as normal if flooding poses a risk.""All evacuation centres will also be sanitised, and regularly monitored to ensure that they are not filled beyond capacity.""The director of Fiji's National Disaster Management Office Vasiti Soko ordered everyone except emergency services to stay off the roads on Fiji's main island Viti Levu.""This is to avoid casualty,"" she said.Hundreds of people are sheltering in evacuation centres around the island.

The cyclone, with wind gusts of up to 285 kilometres per hour near its centre, passed by the south of Tonga this morning (local time).The Tongan Meteorological Service has issued warnings for the Tongatapu and 'Eua island groups with expectations of hurricane-force winds of up to 117kph.There are also warnings of gale force and strong winds for the Ha'apai, Tele-ki-Tonga and Tele-ki-Tokelau island groups and Vava'u, Niuatoputapu and Niuafo'ou islands.The meteorological service said it expected a damaging ocean swell to batter all of Tonga as the storm moves south-east.Tongan National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) has advised people to stay away from coastal areas and avoid sea travel until the storm passes. It is forecast to move out of Tongan waters and downgrade to a category three storm by 7:00pm (local time).In Vanuatu, the devastation is widespread.  Power and water supplies are still down and the majority of homes have been damaged in some way, leaving many homeless.Christina Boelulvanua and her family were among the thousands of people who fled volcanic eruptions on Vanuatu's Ambae island back in 2018.But the tropical cyclone has smashed her new life to pieces.""It's so depressing for me and the family. I ran away from the volcano with my kids thinking 2020 would be safe but then came Cyclone Harold,"" she said.Ms Boelulvanua lives in Banban, a community set up for volcano evacuees in the island of Santo.Nearly everything in Banban has been flattened by Harold's winds. Every house has been damaged and food gardens are wiped out.""Now it's all gone. All the bananas are down, yams are down. So it will take time before we start all over again,"" she said.Like many in Vanuatu, Ms Boelulvanua depends on her garden to feed her family.She told the ABC her family would eat the scraps the cyclone has left them, but she doesn't know what they'll do once it's finished.""Some people who have paid jobs can still survive from buying food from the shop, but [for] others who depend on food crops, I can't see how they can survive,"" she said.Fiji has begun assesses the damage left by Harold, which moved out of the country's waters overnight.Images and vision have emerged showing widespread flooding on the main island Viti Levu.Residents have also reported that roofs were ripped off buildings and roads blocked by fallen trees.  Fiji Red Cross director general Ilisapeci Rokotunidau told the ABC's Pacific Beat program the initial damage from the cyclone was far more severe than anticipated.  ""We didn't predict the amount of saturation there was on land. The floods came up quite quickly and into areas we didn't anticipate,"" Ms Rokotunidau said. Naziah Ali, who lives in the town of Ba — located in the north-west of Viti Levu — told Pacific Beat her town was engulfed. ""The town is flooded, most of the shops that you see open on a Wednesday have been closed and boarded up,"" she said.""I can already envisage how much damage there's going to be to goods and other materials people have in their shops.""She added that she saw widespread crop damage to nearby farms and sugar cane fields. The damage from Harold has made Fiji's management of coronavirus more complex. The country has 15 confirmed cases.""We are doing all of this amid COVID-19 restrictions, so a lot of the [country's] movement has been restricted,"" Ms Rokotunidau said. ""One of the things we have stressed to our volunteers is their own personal safety as they prepare to [help families]."" She said she hoped the Australian Red Cross would donate personal protective equipment (PPE) to Fiji's Red Cross volunteers as they assist in the recovery effort amid COVID-19.The Australian Government has provided the Solomon Islands with more than $99,000 of emergency assistance funds, while New Zealand has also joined Australia in providing more than $480,000 in financial assistance to Vanuatu.A defence jet will leave Australia later today to deliver cyclone relief supplies to Vanuatu. Australia has also confirmed an offer to Fiji of damage surveillance and humanitarian relief supplies.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne told a press conference this morning that officials were ""assessing"" what immediate impact Cyclone Harold was having on Tonga. ""We stand ready to provide what further help we can to our Pacific family in whatever ways we can,"" she said.Australia is working with the Red Cross and other NGOs to provide supplies like tents and water containers in Vanuatu.It is also helping with damage-assessment flights.The ABC has been told the situation is ""grim"" with fears the damage in some places has been as bad as Cyclone Pam, which hit Vanuatu in March 2015, killing at least 15 people and leaving the country with a damage bill of nearly $600 million, more than half of the country's annual GDP.The Australian High Commissioner to Vanuatu was aboard one of the damage-assessment flights and she was joined by the Vanuatu country director for the NGO World Vision, Kendra Gates Derousseau.""Houses were essentially pulled to pieces rather than just wind damage. It was catastrophic,"" Ms Gates told the ABC's Pacific Beat.Ms Gates Derousseau said that eight of her staff ""had lost everything"", including one pregnant staff member who had to run for cover with her family. ""[She] described [being] in the middle of the cyclone, having to take her two young children by the hands and run about 100 metres to another house because a large tree had fallen on her house,"" she said. With the double-whammy of managing coronavirus mitigation and cyclone recovery, Ms Gates Derousseau said Vanuatu's full recovery would take years, and would need international help. ""Given the COVID-19 crisis, I would anticipate that at least the economy will take many years to start again, particularly because Santo [Island] was a massive tourist destination,"" she said. ""The north of the island is also the big agricultural centre. So there will be significant damages sustained because of the loss of crops and the loss of the ability to both internally and externally export.""[But] the Vanuatu people are proving themselves resilient, [and] they will need international assistance to continue with that journey.""

144,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-12/vanuatu-death-defying-nagol-bungee-jumping-tribal-initiation/11855016,"Every year, as Vanuatu's wild monsoon season comes to an end, Chief Luke Fargo instructs the boys of his village to build a 30-metre tower using branches cut from a nearby forest.When the structure stretches to the sky, the boys prepare for the next stage — to jump from the highest platform, with only a vine wrapped around their ankles to catch their fall.In some videos capturing the stomach-turning leap, you can hear the land diver scrape the ground. The 69-year-old chief, who has performed the ritual himself many times, invites people from around the world to watch these land diving ceremonies, called Nagol, from his home on the southern tip of Pentecost Island.But he was saddened when he found out the event had inspired the creation of bungee jumping, a global sport he believes was stolen from his people.""We were shocked because they told us they made a lot of money out of that,"" Mr Fargo said.""I would like to send a message to all the people who use the bungee jump, [that it] was taken from the Pentecost regional land dive.""Mr Fargo says he and other Indigenous chiefs from Vanuatu have called for compensation from bungee jump operators to be funnelled into their communities — but they're pessimistic about actually receiving royalties.""I think if they pay a small [amount of] money to us on the island, it would be better,"" Mr Fargo said.The issue now has now been inscribed into Vanuatu's laws, with a bill to protect Vanuatu's traditional knowledge passed last month.The bill explicitly mentions the Nagol jump of south Pentecost, and its ""resemblance"" to bungee jumping.""The enactment of such legislation will ensure the proper monitoring and regulation of Vanuatu's traditional knowledge and expressions of culture, for commercial use and to ensure that the traditional owners have given their prior informed consent,"" the bill states.""An example being the bungee jump which gets a resemblance of Nagol jump of South Pentecost.""A person who uses that traditional knowledge without the prior informed consent of the traditional owners commits an offence under this Act.""The people of Pentecost island have practised land diving for centuries as a way to celebrate the season's yam harvest.The elaborate ceremony includes traditional dancing where participants men wear nambas, or penis sheaths, and the women wear grass skirts.According to some reports, the ritual grew out of a legend involving a woman running away from her marriage.She fled into the jungle, but, pursued by her husband, scrambled up a tree, tied a vine to her ankle and jumped, managing to land safely. Her husband, failing to affix the vital vine, fell to his death. But Chief Fargo said the ritual now symbolises an initiation for young men and boys — a rite of passage to prove their strength. For decades now, the three-month-long event has drawn in numerous tourists, who pay a $150 fee to watch the young men hurtle toward the ground.Even Queen Elizabeth II was treated to the spectacle during a visit in 1974, but with fatal consequences: because the land diving was held in the wrong season, the vines lacked elasticity and snapped, leading to a death of one of the divers. In 1979, the Vanuatu spectacle inspired Oxford University's Dangerous Sports Club, who decided to recreate it over the Clifton Suspension Bridge in the United Kingdom.New Zealand entrepreneur AJ Hackett then took the idea to found AJ Hackett Bungy in 1988, the oldest commercial bungee jumping operator in the world.Mr Hackett had pioneered an elastic bungee jumping cord in the mid-1980s and shot to global notoriety after bungee jumping off of the Eiffel Tower in 1987. He was immediately arrested, but released after five minutes, according to the company's website. When asked to respond on Indigenous groups calling for recognition, AJ Hackett Bungy said they didn't have anyone available for comment. But the company acknowledges on their website that bungee jumping's origins hail from Vanuatu.John Huri, from Vanuatu's Intellectual Property Office, helped draft the bill.Though he thinks the legislation will not retrospectively help chiefs like Luke Fargo gain royalties from bungee jumpers, he says it will help prevent any future exploitation of Vanuatu's traditional customs.""The issue of Nagol [is one] where the local people stand aside and see people coming in and getting their knowledge and commercialising it … without properly acknowledging and asking the people whether they give their consent to it,"" Mr Huri said.Mr Huri said the Vanuatu Government is also working with UNESCO and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) to change international policies and sign treaties to better recognise the rights of Indigenous intellectual property.He hopes such policies would mean the appropriation of Indigenous customs — like current the tension between bungee jumping and Nagol ceremonies — will not happen again.""[Bungee jumping] is a creation of here, of Vanuatu,"" Mr Huri said.""So we have to come up with this bill so that we can put in place mechanisms where any future case like this will be handled.""There is a growing push from Indigenous groups worldwide for better regulation of the use of traditional knowledge to ensure Indigenous communities are respected by companies that seek to use their cultural knowledge.In December last year, Christian Dior reached a secret deal with New Caledonia's Indigenous Kanak people, after the French fashion company was criticised for patenting native plant extracts for its commercial cosmetics research.In Australia, there have been calls for legislation to stamp out fake Indigenous art appropriating Aboriginal culture, while controversy continues to swirl about the copyright of the Aboriginal flag, after a non-Indigenous company secured exclusive clothing rights to the flag. A recent trademark bid for the exclusive rights to the words ""Gumby Gumby"", which means ""woman woman medicine"" in the Ghungalu language belonging to an Aboriginal people of central Queensland, also sparked anger and calls for reform about who can claim intellectual property rights to Indigenous knowledge. Terri Janke, the founder of an Indigenous law firm based in Sydney, works with Aboriginal and Pacific communities on issues of intellectual property.She says that the current legal systems in Australia and other countries are ill-equipped to protect traditional and customary knowledge.""A lot of times the problem is that the legal system doesn't give any rights to Indigenous people,"" Dr Janke said.""So it's not like running a normal case saying it's patent infringement or trademark infringement — [those Indigenous] rights sit out of it.""For Chief Fargo in South Pentecost, the move to protect Vanuatu's ancient customs from foreign appropriation is vital.""Nagol must be kept always in our traditional customs,"" he said.","Community and Society, Indigenous (Other Peoples), Indigenous Culture, Indigenous Policy, Pacific, Sport, Vanuatu, ",2020-01-11T19:02:57+00:00

The group had raised 1,000 kina ($430) when their act of goodwill temporarily landed them in hot water.Ms Imbu and her team were arrested by PNG police. Their wheelbarrows and collected proceeds were also seized. ""We were brought in for questioning and they said we were not following the proper procedures,"" Ms Imbu said.""We said sorry, but we wanted our voice to be heard, that's why we did this.""The misunderstanding has since been resolved and authorities have put the youth group in touch with the Australian Consulate in PNG.Lae resident and Australian expat Helen Taylor said she was overwhelmed by the grassroots generosity when she came across the group on her drive through the city, that can be fraught with danger.""I must admit, my first thought was 'what are these guys up to?' but when I got closer I could see they were holding up big signs that were all about donating money for the fires in Australia,"" Mrs Taylor said.""It blew me away, I haven't seen anything like that here before [even for] their own natural disaster last year with the earthquake.""The minimum wage in PNG is 3.5-kina an hour, which is just over $1 Australian — these guys have nothing. To be giving cash donations is massive.""Ms Imbu said the wheelbarrow campaign was all about sending love, support and gratitude to a much-loved neighbour. ""We say Australia is our 'Momma Country', the country that helped us to be where we are right now.""""Most of us benefit from Australian aid which builds health centres and hospitals, that's why we took this initiative so that we could at least do something at the community level, that's why we did this.""In Vanuatu, the Pacific's seventh poorest nation, the sentiment — and method of fundraising — was similar.Emma Mesao, who works for Vanuatu Red Cross Society, also led a wheelbarrow push and has a fundraising target of 500,000 vatus ($6,300).""We're trying to give a hand to them (bushfire victims) so they can build their lives again,"" Ms Mesao said.""If there's a disaster in Vanuatu, Australia helps … we get in together to help each other so we're here to help.""The wheelbarrow push is one of three fundraising appeals organised by Red Cross Vanuatu in the capital Port Vila.A benefit concert will be held on Saturday while Red Cross Vanuatu is also appealing for donations via its website.","Bushfire, Disasters and Accidents, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, ",2020-01-11T04:57:12+00:00
147,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-16/abc-celebrating-80-years-of-international-broadcasting/11783252,"阅读中文版本 | Dalam Bahasa IndonesiaThe history of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is a story of Australia's relationship with Asia and the Pacific.For eight decades now, ABC broadcasts have reached lonely atolls in the Pacific as well as some of the planet's largest population centres in Asia.But the ABC's international operations have come a long way from their origins in 1939.Designed to compete as a propaganda service during World War II, radio programs were broadcast in the languages of both Australia's allies and its enemies: initially in French, Dutch, German and Spanish, and after 1942 in Japanese, Thai, Indonesian and Mandarin.Launched as Australia Calling, it was later changed to Radio Australia. The Commonwealth Department of Information handed Radio Australia to the ABC to operate at arm's length, and it became a permanent fixture in 1950.Radio Australia's purpose in those first decades was to expand its foreign language services and reach as many continents as possible, relaying Australian news and views to expats and foreigners alike.But more recent decades have seen dramatic cuts to the ABC's global presence, and while Australian stories are still being told overseas, questions remain over the future of international broadcasting.""It's so important that Australia has a voice in this region, because there's so much misunderstanding between our cultures, and it is a different culture,"" Prodita Sabarini, executive editor of The Conversation Indonesia and an ABC content user, told the documentary Australia Calling.""Without that voice, I don't think we would be able to really understand our neighbour.""In places like China, the ""soft diplomacy"" of the ABC's short-wave radio service gave listeners a very different view of the world than that allowed under chairman Mao Zedong.China only had the Communist Party-authorised state media. Suddenly Radio Australia gave them a new perspective.The popularity of Radio Australia was enormous, and the service received hundreds of thousands of letters each year from China alone.But former China correspondent Helene Chung, who was also the ABC's first female foreign correspondent, said the differences between the two countries in those decades were clear to see.""It was a very backward place. All the Chinese women were in blue suits, flat shoes, no make-up at all, and short-cropped hair,"" she said.Being posted to Beijing from 1983 to 1986 was a profound experience for Chung, who grew up in Hobart.""When I began working for the ABC, I didn't really think about my identity at all,"" she said.""I always thought of myself as Australian-born Chinese, neither Chinese nor Australian, but going to China convinced me — I was not Chinese, I was definitely Australian.""Over time, she has watched China change rapidly, becoming one of the wealthiest countries in the world.However one thing has not changed: Beijing's censorship of domestic as well as foreign media like the ABC, which was blocked in China last year.""The Chinese media is very repressed … As we speak, the Chinese people are not getting the truth about the demonstrations in Hong Kong and any other events,"" Chung said.""Chinese in China still don't know about the Tiananmen Massacre. So it's very important that news services such as Australia's balanced ABC be heard by the Chinese.In 1993, after more than 40 years of Radio Australia, the ABC expanded its international broadcast role to television — but it was shut down four years later when federal budget cuts gutted the corporation.Radio Australia's operating budget was effectively halved, leading to the axing of its Cantonese, Thai and French services, and the closure of its short-wave transmitter to South-East and North-East Asia. The transmitter's signal was sold to Christian missionaries.This meant the ABC could no longer broadcast independently across China and Indonesia, and instead had to rely on local partner stations which agreed to rebroadcast Radio Australia's programs — hopefully without censorship.""[The Howard government] wanted to close Radio Australia and Australian television altogether,"" former foreign minister Alexander Downer told the ABC.The argument was that the ABC had too much money, and the government should not fund it to do foreign work.""I successfully fought that. And including in cabinet meetings, explaining to the cabinet that this was an element of Australian soft power, they certainly didn't all agree with me,"" Mr Downer said.Newspaper editorials were scathing: The Australian, in August 2000, declared that the ""Howard Government's approach to Radio Australia has been short-sighted, incoherent and irresponsible"".The reduction in services came as multiple crises were unfolding on Australia's doorstep.Unrest across Indonesia in 1998 led to the fall of strongman leader Suharto, and little more than a year later, bloodshed in Timor-Leste saw an Australian-led peacekeeping force deployed to the region.Until the cuts, hundreds of thousands of Indonesians had listened to Radio Australia.""I think it was a bad decision,"" current ABC Chair Ita Buttrose said of the cuts.""It's reduced the impact of what we do. Radio Australia doesn't have the same kind of voice it used to have.""The Howard government later backflipped on television broadcasts, supporting the ABC's return to an international service in 2001.It lasted just over a decade until, suddenly and unexpectedly, the Abbott government pulled the plug one year into a 10-year funding deal.The ABC later cut its remaining short-wave radio broadcasts to the Pacific region in January 2017, arguing the technology was outdated.Radio Australia's former short-wave frequencies were subsequently snapped up by China Radio International, China's state-owned broadcaster.The decision to end short-wave radio caused deep concern for some Pacific leaders; short-wave transmissions are capable of reaching remote islands not serviced by FM radio, providing emergency information and warnings.""Radio Australia short wave saves lives, especially during natural disasters,"" Vanuatu Prime Minister Charlot Salwai said.Mr Salwai said Radio Australia's short-wave service was a vital lifeline when Cyclone Pam struck his country in 2015, and while they are attempting to build their own radio capacity, many ni-Vanuatu still rely on ABC broadcasts.""You save lives by informing people that a cyclone is coming,"" he said.""When we don't have any coverage, we depend on the ABC.""Australia's voice in the region has now moved into a very crowded digital world.Based in the ABC's Asia-Pacific Newsroom, Erwin Renaldi works on digital content in his native language, Bahasa Indonesia, hoping to bridge a deep cultural divide.""[Indonesia and Australia] are very close geographically but we are so different,"" he said.""What we are trying to do is more creating the conversation between young people, particularly young people, to address that misunderstanding.""The ABC is increasingly trying to reach international audiences through the internet; the ABC's iview streaming service is now available to overseas users via an app, and the ABC News website also offers articles in Chinese and Tok Pisin. It is also still broadcasting television overseas through ABC Australia, however this is all done on a relatively tight budget.By way of comparison, China has $3 billion for its China Central Television (CCTV) service, and the BBC has $500 million. The ABC's international operations budget is just $11 million, the same as it was in the 1980s.""It's time to review this, we have a wonderful reputation in the Asia-Pacific region,"" Ms Buttrose said.""We are trusted, people know we deliver reliable news and programs — it's the sort of trust you cannot get any other way.With the Australian Broadcasting Corporation celebrating 80 years of international broadcasts this year, she said it was a good time to re-examine what the ABC's role should be in this field.""I'm an optimist — I hope that by talking about these issues … there will be a re-thinking of as a nation where we want to ABC International to go,"" she said.""I think it should be forward. I think it should be playing that soft-power diplomacy role that it does so well.""Australia Calling will air tonight at 9:20pm on the ABC, and Friday night at 8:30pm on ABC Australia.Read the story in Chinese: 阅读中文版本 or Bahasa Indonesia: Baca dalam Bahasa Indonesia","Asia, Australia, Broadcasting, China, Climate Change - Disasters, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Indonesia, Journalism, Mobile and Internet Access, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Radio, Radio Broadcasting, Television Broadcasting, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2019-12-15T18:47:33+00:00
148,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-06/coronavirus-fears-are-seeing-pacific-islands-turn-back-cruises/12019916,"Cruise ships have been denied port calls in some Pacific Island nations as governments around the region move to batten down the hatches in the face of a potential coronavirus pandemic.Two cruise ships with thousands of passengers each were told to stay clear of islands in Vanuatu and Cook Islands respectively this week — the latter full of holidaymakers from virus hotspot Italy.Meanwhile, Samoa has cut plane arrivals from New Zealand by almost half after that country detected its first coronavirus cases, with several countries across the region putting strict new entry policies in place.Most Pacific nations do not have direct international transport links to the countries most affected by coronavirus — like China, South Korea, Italy and Iran — but they are not taking any chances.""The importation of a case into the Pacific is possible, it is likely,"" Meru Sheel, an epidemiologist and population health expert at the Australian National University, told the ABC.""While the Pacific doesn't have direct connectivity to many of these countries, it's still possible that they will get a case.""Here is what you need to know.Despite a handful of scares and a whole lot of misinformation on social media, no confirmed cases of coronavirus have been detected in Pacific Island nations so far.However, several people were placed in isolation in countries across the region pending test results.That included a 15-month-old girl in Fiji who recently arrived from the US, a 37-year-old Fijian woman who recently travelled to Italy, and a three-year-old Fijian boy and his mother who returned from Bali and Singapore.Their contacts are currently being traced, according to local media reports.But late Thursday, the Fijian Government wrote on Twitter that ""all test results for suspected coronavirus cases have come back negative"" and Fiji was still coronavirus-free.A Tongan woman who recently came back from Sydney is also being tested, and authorities there are also looking for people she has been in contact with.Test results are also pending in Palau for a 73-year-old woman from the US who health officials say is in a stable condition.Health authorities in some Pacific Island nations have made the assessment that the risk posed by large groups of foreigners disembarking on their shores is far too high, given the spread of coronavirus to more than 70 countries worldwide.While this would be frustrating for those on board, it is not a decision Pacific leaders are making lightly — cruise ship passengers are vital to the region's tourism industries.Cook Islands this week decided to prevent the MSC Magnifica from making a stop at the island of Aitutaki, an itinerary change that cost the territory around $200,000 according to tourism officials.The ship was still able to stop at the largest island, Rarotonga, where four passengers were admitted to hospital for medical issues not related to coronavirus.Eleven cruises that were scheduled to stop in the Cook Islands' outer islands over the next two months have now had their visits cancelled, while Tonga and Samoa are also blocking cruise ship arrivals for the time being.A bit closer to Australia, the islands of Lifou, Mare and the Isle of Pines in New Caledonia have all barred cruise ships from visiting, while the Royal Caribbean-operated Voyager of the Seas cruise ship was last week turned away from Vanuatu.There were several cases of the flu on board, and Vanuatu made the decision ""out of an abundance of caution"", a spokesperson for the Vanuatu Tourism Office told the ABC.""Cruise ships are not banned from calling at Vanuatu ports — Golden Princess is currently in Vila Harbour and another one is scheduled for later this week,"" the spokesperson said.Voyager of the Seas, which also had to abandon planned stops in New Caledonia, was ultimately forced to head away from the tropics and toward the colder climes of New Zealand.In a statement, Royal Caribbean said the itineraries for the ship's upcoming March cruises — one of which leaves Sydney tomorrow — were ""currently under review"".Several countries are now requiring visitors to provide a medical clearance report issued within the previous three days prior to boarding any flights.Officials in Samoa have also reduced the number of international flights arriving in the country, most notably from near neighbour New Zealand, which has had services cut from 11 flights per week to six.While the World Health Organisation (WHO)` has not recommended that countries put travel restrictions in place, Sean Casey from the WHO's Pacific Joint Incident Management Team said island nations faced ""a difficult situation"".""Many Pacific countries don't have critical care capability, hospitals are relatively small, there's a limited number of health workers,"" he told the ABC.""The consequences of an imported case may be higher, so countries are making these determinations considering the risks and potential consequences.""Mr Casey said an additional complication was the high rate of non-communicable disease in the Pacific, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and chronic respiratory diseases.""We know that coronavirus is disproportionately affecting older persons and persons with comorbidities,"" he said.""So we're worried — we don't know exactly how it's going to play out, but there are definite vulnerabilities.""Pacific governments are working with the WHO to prepare for coronavirus spreading to their islands, a process that involves training health workers on how to protect themselves and the community.A number of Pacific countries are establishing emergency operations centres, or activating them if they are already in place.""Countries are doing really everything they can to prepare, to identify cases that may come in at points of entry, or to identify, isolate and manage cases that are detected at a community level,"" Mr Casey said.Getting personal protective equipment like gloves, masks, goggles, gowns and face shields out to health facilities across the region has been a focus.This is no simple task, given we're talking about countries composed of hundreds of tiny islands — Fiji for instance has 332 islands, 106 of which are inhabited.""If they don't have preparedness activities done in one particular part of the country or island, by the time they get to that in the case of an outbreak, that would be a delayed response,"" Dr Sheel from the ANU said.""They probably need to be just as prepared as any other country, but … It takes time for things to get there if they're not prepared.""Australia has supported these efforts by sending equipment and medical supplies to Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Timor-Leste, helping several nations plan their strategies in the event of an outbreak, and running diagnostic tests for suspected coronavirus cases.However, recent measles outbreaks across the region mean some countries are already experienced at dealing with these sorts of crises.""The measles experience in the Pacific has probably really taught them and equipped them,"" Dr Sheel said.""The principles will apply even for coronavirus disease, and I think we should be looking at the positives and trying our best to facilitate that in these countries.""","Australia, Diseases and Disorders, Health, Infectious Diseases (Other), New Caledonia, New Zealand, Pacific, Respiratory Diseases, Samoa, Tourism and Leisure

149,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-16/pacific-women-supported-by-millions-of-donated-bras/11412234,"Every night after Maylalani Maafu gets home from work, she washes the one bra she owns, hoping it will dry for the next day.Her job as a customs broker on the Vava'u islands in Tonga pays her 25 Pa'anga ($16) a day, one dollar less than the cost of a mid-range bra. ""Maybe I'll just buy one [bra] for the year … If I buy two I can't feed my kids,"" Ms Maafu said. It's a plight that affects many women across the Pacific. Well-made bras are usually too expensive and women often have to travel from remote villages into cities if they want to buy one.Even when bras are available, they are often imported from China and are sometimes too small or ill-fitting for Pacific women. Those working to bring the highly sought-after undergarments to the Pacific say the gift of a decent bra can make all the difference — without them, women can be discouraged from being active in the sporting arena or even in local community matters. Fifteen years ago Liz Baker, a chiropractor based in Melbourne, started the Uplift Project to help get bras to women in the Pacific.She told the ABC during that time the not-for-profit organisation has collected around 2.5 million bras.Through the help of local rotary clubs and a team of 300 volunteers, Uplift organises drop off points around Australia and New Zealand for people to donate bras. They are then sorted and sent on shipping containers to Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji.Naomi Roberts, the Fijian coordinator for Uplift, moved to Australia from Fiji when she was 17.""When I would go back to Fiji during school holidays the ladies in the village would ask 'do you have any spare bras?'"" she said.""So we would go to the markets and buy second-hand bras to take because we'd definitely be asked for one."" Last week the Uplift's New Zealand branch received more than 1500 bras from women's networks in Government departments, which are now set to be shipped to Fiji. Belinda Waters, from the New Zealand Ministry of Justice, said she was stunned by the mountain of donations.""The thing that really got me was that a lot of these women will never own another bra in their life — this is the only one they will ever get,"" she told Radio New Zealand. Ms Roberts said the bras provide support especially for women with bigger bust sizes who tend to hunch in order to hide their breasts.""In the village they will stand at the back and not say anything because they don't want them to be seen,"" she said. She added the need for affordable, good quality bras is not just about having an extra clothing option, but about dignity.""It's empowering … it's something that is theirs and theirs alone,"" she said. The bras aren't just important for women who have breasts but for those who have lost them.Ms Baker told the ABC Uplift also sends out breast forms and silicone breast prosthetics for women who had lost one or both breasts to cancer. It can restore their confidence, she said, rather than being a painful reminder of what they have been through.""Some women weep, especially if they have been given a breast form,"" she said.Sports bras are also particularly in demand with young girls wanting to get involved in sports.""They don't have to worry about putting their hands across their chest when they run,"" Ms Roberts said.It can even impact women competing at elite levels, with Ms Baker saying the issue impacts women wanting to play for Papua New Guinea's AFL team. ""When they came to visit Australia a while back, we noticed that it was only people who had A and B cups that were playing,"" she said, adding it was hard for those needing larger cup sizes to find the right support.The ABC has reached out to the PNG women's AFL team, but did not receive a response by deadline.However, the initiative is not without criticism. In the past, the Aloa Foundation in East Timor has criticised Uplift for undermining local businesses with its charity. Belinda Roselli is the founder of Mamma's Leaf Vanuatu — a charity that delivers washable sanitary pads and raises awareness around menstrual health with women in the villages. She has helped distribute bras for Uplift and says she has faced some backlash. ""There are some people who have said to me 'well, you shouldn't be bringing white women's expectations on life and what they think is normal into the Pacific',"" she said. But Ms Maafu said the bras have been warmly welcomed in Tonga, especially by those who need them most.She said specialised mastectomy bras were particularly appreciated by women who have suffered from breast cancer, as were maternity bras for new mothers. ""You can't believe how excited they are to receive those bras, because it's more expensive than the normal bra,"" Ms Maafu said.","Australia, Community and Society, Fiji, Foreign Aid, New Zealand, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Social Systems, Tonga, Vanuatu, Women's Health, Womens Status, ",2019-08-15T19:14:46+00:00

Vanuatu is one of only three countries around the world that currently has no women sitting in its Parliament.The other two countries, Papua New Guinea and the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), are also in the Pacific — and the region is over-represented among countries with less than 10 per cent female representation in their parliaments.The reasons for this are complex and vary from country to country: in Tonga, for example, nine of the country's 27 parliamentary seats must go to representatives of the country's noble class, which consists solely of men.But there are some common issues across countries, including a lack of economic equality between men and women and a general attitude that representative politics is a ""man's job"".""Men have this mindset that women are supposed to be at home doing domestic work, creating babies,"" Dr Thomas said.""That's their role, they're not supposed to be leaders. It's the man's job to be leading, governing and managing.""Some countries, like Samoa, have put in place measures that ensure a number of women are always elected to parliament, however these systems have not been widely adopted and have proven controversial.Last year, Oxfam came under fire in Vanuatu for its 'Vot Woman' campaign, which called for a 50 per cent gender quota in the country's Parliament: critics accused the international NGO of trying to interfere in Vanuatu's political system.The Leleon Vanua Democratic Party's decision to pull out of this year's election has not stopped women from contesting altogether.Seventeen of the candidates in the running are women, standing either as independents or with other parties — but that's out of just under 300 candidates in total.Dr Thomas has also decided to continue her campaign and is now standing as a candidate for the Oceania Transformation Movement alongside her cousin, Manina Packete.Ms Packete's daughter Lisa, who lives in Sydney, told the ABC she was ""super proud"" of their persistence despite the challenges.""Vanuatu is such a male-dominated society that it has taken a lot for the women to get to this level, for women to contest alone,"" she said.""I am super proud of them because I know how strong they each are in their own way.""Lisa Packete said she hoped at least one woman would be successful: she remembers as a young girl looking up to Hilda Lini, the woman who became Vanuatu's first female MP when she was elected in 1987.""Even if one gets in, that would be incredible, it would send a message to the younger generation that it is possible,"" she said.But Ms Lini told the ABC she thought it would take time to convince many voters that women can lead the country.""It's a new concept for a lot of people here, men and women, and they were not ready to support it,"" she said.The veteran politician is the Leleon Vanua Democratic Party's president and said the party is now planning to contest the 2024 election.Women have been overlooked in the previous two elections, with not a single female candidate elected in the 2012 and 2016 polls.Dr Thomas said she hopes the situation for female candidates in Vanuatu changes in the future.""It's going to take many years and a lot of educated work to assist men to change and transform their mindsets, that women should also have a place in the decision-making of a nation,"" she said.","Pacific, Politics and Government, Vanuatu, Women, World Politics, ",2020-03-18T19:12:28+00:00

""This ordeal has been incredibly hard on all of us. Now our Christmas dream is coming true,"" he said.Mr McGarry, a Canadian citizen, was the media director for the Vanuatu Daily Post newspaper before his work visa renewal was denied in early November.The Vanuatu Government claimed his application to renew was rejected because it was deemed that his job should be held by a local citizen.However, Mr McGarry has said he believes the decision was politically motivated.Mr McGarry appealed days later and travelled to Brisbane for a conference, but when he attempted to board a return flight to Vanuatu, he was denied. ""Nobody should ever be refused entry to Vanuatu just for speaking the truth.

Meanwhile, Papua New Guinea has offered 1,000 personnel, including soldiers and firefighters, who ""stand ready to be deployed"" at Mr Scott Morrison's invitation. ""Papua New Guinea conveys our sympathies, sorrow and grief in your moment of pain,"" Prime Minister James Marape wrote on Facebook. ""Australia is the closest friend of PNG and is always the first in PNG in our times of adversities and we offer our hearts and our hands to you in this time of fire-induced tragedies.""PNG also set up a Fire Appeal Secretariat to assist Australia, with Mr Marape the patron overseeing the fundraising effort.

Australians are in the prayers of every Fijian.""Mr Morrison in a press conference yesterday noted the worldwide reaction to the bushfires, saying ""thank you very much for your support"".Pacific analyst Tess Newton Cain, from the Griffith Asia Institute, said although many Australians might be used to giving aid to the Pacific, not receiving it, the offers were ""not surprising"". ""It's not surprising to see Pacific Islanders and Pacific Island countries wanting to reach out and offer their support at this time,"" she told ABC's Pacific Beat. ""I think it actually speaks to something a lot more long-standing and deeply felt, which is the value that is placed on the relationship with Australia by Pacific Islanders,"" she said, highlighting that many in the Pacific wanted the relationship to be ""one of equals"" and saw an opportunity to ""give back"". While stars like Pink and Nicole Kidman have pledged $500,000 apiece to the bushfire crisis, and Australian comedian Celeste Barber has raised $33 million, Dr Newton Cain pointed out that to these smaller nations, the donations amounted to large sums. Australia recently disappointed its Pacific neighbours at the Pacific Island Forum, where Mr Morrison was criticised for putting coal before Pacific countries and the existential threat they face due to rising sea levels and climate change.Dr Newton Cain said the Pacific leaders' offers of help did not contain a ""told you so"" mentality but, at the same time, she suspected they would hope that Australia might change its climate stance in the wake of the fires.""I think within the Pacific there will be an expectation that perhaps Australia's position will be a bit more aligned with the one that they've been putting forward for quite some time,"" she said.""They would certainly hope that events such as we've seen over the last few weeks would have created perhaps a new and different conversation within the Australian policy community.""I don't know whether the Pacific's going to be disappointed on that score, but I think it is something that we would expect to see further down the track.""The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been approached for comment.

One that can get you into scores of countries — including Europe, the UK, Hong Kong, Singapore and Russia — without needing a visa?Or perhaps you'd like to park your money in a tax haven where there are no personal or corporate income taxes.Maybe you'd just like to get away from the rat race and live on a picturesque tropical island in the South Pacific.Vanuatu, then, could be the place for you.These are some of the selling points of Vanuatu's citizenship by investment scheme, or cash-for-passports as it's also known locally.Sales have been booming in recent years, providing the Government with an unexpected but lucrative source of revenue.But not everyone is happy about the scheme, with several prominent locals — including former presidents and high-ranking chiefs — saying it undermines the value of Vanuatu citizenship and the country's fight to gain independence from its former colonial masters, the French and British.The recent deportation of a group of Chinese nationals, some of whom had obtained Vanuatu citizenship, focused even more adverse attention on the scheme.Many countries have citizenship by investment schemes but often applicants are required to become permanent residents first and then only after a number of years do they become eligible to become a citizen.Under Vanuatu's scheme, successful applicants can become citizens within a matter of months, and there's no requirement to reside in the country or even set foot on Vanuatu soil at all.It costs around $US150,000 ($220,900) for a single application and more for couples and families.Interested parties submit their applications through agents who've been approved by the Citizenship's Office and Commission, which oversees the entire process.The job of screening an applicant's criminal and financial backgrounds is performed by the Government's Financial Intelligence Unit.If their client's application is successful, the agent pockets around a third of the application fee.Once approved, freshly minted citizens can then apply for the real prize, a Vanuatu passport.Pure and simple: to raise revenue. There have been several iterations of Vanuatu's citizenship by investment scheme since it was first introduced in 2014.The aim of one of them was to raise money to rebuild the country after Cyclone Pam caused widespread devastation in 2015.Despite the rising tide of domestic criticism, the Government has largely remained tight-lipped about how many passports have been sold and how much money has been raised.But in June, a parliamentary committee told local media that more than 4,000 passports had been sold under the scheme. The Vanuatu Daily Post newspaper examined government financial statements and found that sales sky-rocketed last year, with 1,800 passports sold in 2018 alone.Most have been sold to people from mainland China even though it's technically illegal to hold dual citizenship under Chinese law.Six Chinese nationals were arrested in the capital Port Vila in late June and later deported back to China at the request of Beijing law enforcement officials.The group was allegedly running an online financial scam targeting people back in China.Before their deportation it emerged that four of them had successfully applied for Vanuatu citizenship and obtained passports.Critics of the citizenship by investment scheme said the incident validated their concerns that undesirable people were buying passports for nefarious purposes.Vanuatu's founding president Ati George Sokomanu said the sale of Vanuatu citizenship was demeaning to those who had struggled to achieve the country's independence.""The Government needs to state clearly how many passports have been sold, who they've been sold to, and how much revenue the sales have generated,"" Mr Sokomanu said.""We achieved our name and now put it on sale and people are coming in and we don't know [who] we're inviting,"" he said.The Financial Intelligence Unit later said none of the deported Chinese nationals had a criminal record and Chinese officials informed local authorities of their investigation after they had been granted citizenship.","Emigration, Government and Politics, Immigration, Pacific, Vanuatu, ",2019-08-06T19:16:51+00:00

I heard a story from one person who said he'd had a gun pointed to his head and was told to shut up and go home.""But Mr McGarry said he was not deterred and is determined to return to Vanuatu.""My family's there, it's my home,"" he said. ""If I walk away and watch the country slide away from democracy, how am I going to sleep at night?""Mr McGarry is currently staying at the Brisbane home of his friend, Pacific expert Tess Newton Cain.""It has been a trying weekend … he's obviously under a lot of stress,"" she told Pacific Beat.Ms Newton Cain said that Vanuatu's refusal to let Mr McGarry return under the ""pretence"" of administrative issues had been ""completely stripped away"" by the fact he was unable to join his flight home.""This is now a purely political situation,"" she said.The ABC contacted the Government of Vanuatu for comment but had not received a response by deadline.Samisoni Pareti, a senior journalist from Fiji who also attended the Brisbane media freedom, said it was too early to claim politics were involved.""Was it to do with, a merely administrative matter … or is it wider reasons behind this?""The decision has been criticised by media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF), however, as signalling a ""grave"" situation for media freedom in the Pacific.""Make no mistake, this work permit cancellation is just a way of punishing a journalist whose investigative reporting annoyed the Government,"" said Daniel Bastard, head of the Asia-Pacific desk at RSF, in a statement which called upon Mr Salwai to ""immediately reconsider a decision that is both mean and unjust"".""This crude violation of press freedom fuels grave concern about the situation throughout the Pacific region and must not serve as an example,"" Mr Bastard added.","Asia, Australia, China, Government and Politics, Pacific, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2019-11-18T09:06:28+00:00

156,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-28/cruise-ship-rescued-three-sailors-arrive-in-brisbane/11557182,"Three sailors have described their lucky rescue by a P&O cruise ship near New Caledonia after they were forced to abandon their sinking boat.Cousins Chris and Kevin Doran from Newcastle, and Ben Johnson from Vanuatu, arrived in Brisbane on Saturday morning after being picked up by the Pacific Dawn on Thursday. Chris Doran said his motor cruiser boat, Liberty, came to an abrupt stop around 5:30am during their trip from Vanuatu to Queensland's Gold Coast. ""Initially we thought we might have hit a reef, but looking at the navigation map, that wasn't the case,"" Chris Doran said. They then discovered a large ship's rope had wrapped around both propellers and caused the boat to start filling with water.""How do you hit a piece of rope in the middle of the ocean? Bad luck,"" Chris Doran said. After about two hours of pumping water, the decision was made to get into the life raft and abandon the boat. They activated their emergency beacon and made a call for help. The Pacific Dawn received a call from marine authorities in Noumea, when it was about 55 nautical miles away from the men. Pacific Dawn Captain Alan Dockeray contacted the sailors on a satellite phone telling them he was on his way to pick them up. ""It's a no-brainer isn't it? You've got to go help them,"" Captain Dockeray said.""Fortunately they were on the route, so I didn't have to turn back or anything like that. ""They're very nice unexpected guests — they didn't even look the part of shipwrecked sailors when they came onboard."" Sailor Ben Johnson described the moment of seeing the huge ship on the horizon. ""What a sight — that's when it all hit, how are we going to get on and then we started thinking how is this going to go down?"" Mr Johnson said. ""Everyone is telling us to buy lotto tickets."" A tender boat was lowered from the cruise ship and brought them aboard. ""It could've been a lot worse, especially if it happened in the middle of the night and the ship was further away,"" Chris Doran said. One of the men tried to call his wife three times but she had not answered, so Mr Johnson called his wife in Vanuatu who helped coordinate the rescue effort. Kevin Doran said at one stage, when he was manning the hand pump below the deck, he had a moment of fear. He told his fellow crew members, ""Don't leave me here!""The three men said their biggest fear once on the life raft was drifting onto a reef, but they were only floating in the raft for about three hours when the cruise ship found them.""I think we were only six miles from a reef, which would've cut the raft up — plus us — and would've been the end,"" Chris Doran said. Once onboard the Pacific Dawn, the men were taken for a medical and provided with a cabin and food. Kevin Doran went straight to the shop to buy a shirt and pants. He said the rescue came down to being well-prepared and very lucky. ""The safety equipment all worked correctly, we knew where it was, we knew what to do,"" Kevin Doran said. The trio thanked the captain and staff of the Pacific Dawn. Chris Doran said he had his boat Liberty for six years and it was very sad to see it go. ""A lot of memories with the family — it was a beautiful boat,"" Chris Doran said.The men have all had 40 years' boating experience and said the ordeal has not stopped them wanting to get back out on the water.

157,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-21/blackbirding-legacy-haunts-tanna-vanuatu/11764586,"Mention 'blackbirding' anywhere on this island and you'll hear harrowing stories of missing boys and men. This is a place where the past haunts the present.This beach looks like paradise.It's on the tiny island of Tanna, in Vanuatu in the South Pacific.Its white sands, turquoise rock pools and volcanic reefs are a huge part of everyday life, used by islanders for hunting, cooking and ceremony.But this paradise has a harrowing past.The beach is where thousands of boys and young men were kidnapped, tricked or coerced onto boats, and taken roughly 2,000 kilometres to Australia. They were forced to work on sugarcane plantations. Many never returned home.It happened 150 years ago, but many people are still struggling to come to terms with it.""Whenever you want to go down the beach, you have to make sure you go with friends — don't ever go by yourself,"" says local woman Josephine Gideon.What happened on Tanna is known as blackbirding.Tens of thousands of Pacific Islanders throughout Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands also became caught up in the trade.It was started in 1847 by a New South Wales-based grazier, and 16 years later the idea to import Pacific labour was picked up further north in Queensland.Until the trade ended in 1901, around 62,000 people — mostly boys and young men — were taken to work on sugar plantations.Some went willingly.Most did not.As contracts were signed and men were paid — although their wages were significantly less than their European counterparts — the Australian government legislated the trade as indentured labour.But many argue that blackbirding was slavery.""The definition of slavery is basically about one man's control over another,"" says Emelda Davis, chairwoman of Australian South Sea Islanders.""These people never benefitted from their contribution or being brought to this country.""They were severely discriminated against, they lost their families, they lost their money, they lost their lives.""More than 4,000 Tannese were blackbirded to Australia — a huge portion of the small island population of that time.Today, no-one on the island has direct lived experience of blackbirding, but the Tannese seem to have a collective memory of that time.The mention of blackbirding is met with harrowing stories of missing boys and men.High up in the hills of Tanna, in a small village called Iounan, Tom Niman tells the story of the disappearance of 12-year-old Iasu.On the day he disappeared, Iasu's older brother Niman was preparing a turtle to eat. That required salt water, so Niman asked Iasu to walk down to the beach to get some.Carrying two hollowed-out coconuts to collect the water, Iasu made his way down a well-worn track to the beach.He didn't come back.Niman went to the beach to search for his little brother.But he only found a coconut container discarded on the shore, and a shoe print in the sand.""Then he knew that somebody has taken Iasu,"" Tom says.""Because at that time we don't have shoes, we don't have clothes.""Tom says Niman — having heard of similar disappearances — knew then that ""white man"" had kidnapped his brother.Iasu's family never saw him again.Tom's family continues to wonder what happened to him, and whether they have relatives in Australia.There are many others wondering the same thing.This family even has a photo, showing a descendant of a Tannese man who was blackbirded in the 1800s.He's of their bloodline.But other than this photo they know very little about him.Blackbirding stopped in 1901 with the introduction of the White Australia Policy and subsequently the Pacific Labour Act, designed to facilitate the mass deportation of South Sea Islanders working in Queensland's sugar industry.Fifteen per cent of those blackbirded to Australia died from exposure to foreign illnesses, malnutrition, mistreatment. Of those who lived, some were sent home to the wrong island, and some managed to stay in Australia. Others did return home.One Tannese man, Naoam Tom, brought back a warning in the form of a song.To this day, at a clearing under a huge banyan tree in his village of Loutaliko, people gather to sing it.The English translation of the song, in part, goes:""They recall back to the bad times,""Bad treatment, low wages, small food and water, hard labour, foreign language.""So they said 'watch out for Australia'.""Steven Naoam, Tom's great-grandson, says the song ""belongs to Australians"". ""When a song is composed for you, it belongs to you,"" he says.He sees the song as a message from his ancestors to be wary of Australia during the blackbirding period.""The song is mainly about how the white men treated … our black men when they carried them to sugar cane plantations and they treated them very badly,"" he says.In other parts of Tanna, people are actively taking a stance against Australians and Europeans.The main town, Lenakel, is also known as Blackman Town — and locals explain that that's exactly what it is.""Blackman Town means we own all the businesses and we also own this little town — there's no white fella,"" Pastor Steven Iamniko says.That's in stark contrast to many of the businesses across the rest of Vanuatu, which are owned by expats — though Blackman Town does welcome tourists.And beyond the preservation of the local economy, it seems the aim of Blackman Town is also to preserve culture.""We want to own our custom, we don't want to destroy our custom,"" local Ialou Tre says.According to Tannese man Samson Numake, the origins of Blackman Town stem back to his grandfather, who was blackbirded.Samson says his grandfather was deeply affected by his experience, and returned to Tanna with an idea.""The town will be occupied by Tannese people and the people from Vanuatu only, no European to run the business,"" he says.Samson says the idea was implemented well after his grandfather passed away, by himself and his father.""I know that if he's somewhere in Heaven, he will be very glad because I named the town after him,"" Samson says.But despite this resistance, the impact of blackbirding continues to take a toll on Tanna.Josephine was born roughly 100 years after the start of the trade, but remembers as a child being startled by the sound of boats, cars and by the sight of white people.""We were scared because we heard the story that white people were not good people,"" she says.For the island dwellers, blackbirding also brought about a fear of the ocean.""Because of the stories that we hear that people were taken from the beach, from the reef, from the ocean,"" Josephine explains.Perhaps one of the biggest reminders of the trade is language.Today Vanuatu's national language is Bislama, a creole language formed during the blackbirding time.""They really wanted to communicate with their mother languages but the white people won't allow them,"" Josephine explains.So they developed Bislama, or ""mixed language"", to communicate.In the early 1900s, as people from Vanuatu returned to their islands, they brought Bislama with them.Asked how she feels speaking Bislama, Josephine says: ""When I'm angry I use Bislama. When I want to say some just lovely words, I say it in my mother language — it sounds best to me.""Many people of Tanna would like a formal apology from Australia.It might help them heal.""Our great-grandfathers were working like slaves in Australia,"" local Tom Kaltoy says.""Is the Australian government still thinking if it can give us something like compensation? Or nothing?""In 1994 the Keating government recognised the descendants of Australia's blackbirding trade for the pain, suffering and severe discrimination imposed on their community.Yet little has been done by way of acknowledging the experiences of the South Sea Islanders and the impact that blackbirding has had on islands like Tanna.In 2013, marking the 150th anniversary of blackbirding, Vanuatu's then-prime minister Moana Carcasses Kalosil, called on the Australian government to give a formal apology.Nothing was done.The ABC understands the Government is not actively considering a formal apology at this time.As the people of Tanna wait, life goes on.  Gardens continue to be tended; oceans continue to be fished.But for this community, the past is always there.And it continues to haunt the present.","Australia, Foreign Affairs, History, Human Interest, Pacific, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2020-02-20T18:55:56+00:00

Yesterday Australian officials sat quietly in their chairs as Pacific leader after Pacific leader delivered stern warnings about the lethal threat that climate change poses to their nations.Regional heavyweights had gathered at an historic climate change summit convened with the UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres.Mr Guterres is intent on building global momentum for sharper cuts to emissions, arguing that drastic action is necessary to stave off ecological disaster.The Pacific is on the ""front line of climate change"", Mr Guterres told the meeting.""It has a unique moral authority to speak out. It's time for the world to listen.""Senior Australian officials at the meeting could do little else; sent in the place of Prime Minister Scott Morrison only days before the federal election, they were bound to observer status by the caretaker conventions.As a result, Australia did not sign up to the final statement by Pacific leaders, which declared climate change a ""global catastrophe"" and called for ""transformative action"" to stop it.But who was to blame for this ""global catastrophe""?Both Antonio Guterres and Pacific leaders were careful not to point fingers — delicately saying that ""large countries"", ""developed countries"" and the ""whole global community"" had a responsibility to act.But the reality is of all the countries ringed around Mr Guterres at the Fiji meeting, only two — Australia and New Zealand — make a meaningful contribution to climate change.And while Pacific leaders have praised New Zealand's announcement that it wants to go carbon neutral by 2050, many are frustrated that Australia has failed to curb its emissions.One Pacific official told the ABC the meeting's call for radical action on climate change ""really was aimed at the whole globe"" but ""for those in the room [it] was a message for one country"".""Of course no-one said Australia. No-one needed to say Australia,"" the official said. ""What other country in the room could we be referring to?""The outspoken Prime Minister of Samoa, Tuilaepa Sailele, went much further, wading straight into Australia's election campaign during the post-summit press conference.Antonio Guterres had already firmly batted away a question about Australia's debate on climate change, wryly observing that foreigners should never meddle in domestic election debates.It looked like the event would wrap up without controversy. But Mr Sailele reached unbidden for the microphone to volunteer his own answer.""I think we should not worry too much about it,"" he declared.""The question will be answered by the [Australian] voters. Let us keep our fingers crossed!""The message was unmistakable. Uneasy laughter rippled through the room. At least one Australian official was deeply unimpressed.Some Australian politicians are also irritated by the rhetoric from other Pacific leaders on climate change.They point out that it's easy to demand a zero carbon future when you emit nothing, and say the Pacific doesn't understand how ""ruinous"" it would be for Australia to rapidly cut emissions.""They just say the words, we bear the burden,"" was how one Coalition frontbencher described it.They predict that there will long be a gap between what the Pacific would like Australia to do on climate policy, and what Australian Governments — Labor or Coalition — will actually contemplate.But decision makers in Canberra also know that the Pacific is increasingly impatient about Australia's long and painful debate on climate policy.The argument will flare up again in only months when regional leaders gather for the Pacific Islands Forum on tiny Tuvalu, which has long been a vocal champion for drastic climate action.And this time, Australia will not be sitting on the sidelines.","Climate Change, Climate Change - Disasters, Environment, Environmental Impact, Environmental Management, Environmental Policy, Fiji, Government and Politics, New Zealand, Pacific, Samoa, Vanuatu, ",2019-05-15T17:43:31+00:00

That's precisely what Canadian digital artist and filmmaker Michael Dalton-Smith has done, capturing stunning up-close shots and footage. The project was part of a new film titled Volcanoes 3D, which premiered at Melbourne Museum's IMAX cinema this week. When asked just how close he got to the edge, Dalton-Smith said he and his crew were ""sometimes right in them"" despite being ""terrified of volcanoes"". ""Depends if my wife would be listening — usually if she's around, I tend to stay quite far away. But we get quite close in what we do,"" he said. ""We could be a couple of hundred metres from the eruptive crater, and within the fallout zone of the stuff, and it gets a bit hairy.""I'm actually a big chicken on a volcano, and I'm glad for tripods because otherwise the camera would really be shaking throughout this film because of the nerves.""There's always a level of danger. You can never fully predict what a volcano is going to do.""Travelling on the heels of intrepid explorers Carsten Peters and Chris Horsley, Dalton-Smith said it was often difficult — not to mention expensive — to get insurance for such high-level endeavours, and he had lost more than one drone to the mouth of a volcano. His team often slept in 15-minute blocks near the craters they were capturing on camera. ""We go up at night because the incandescent bombs that are thrown out of these things — you can actually see where they're landing,"" he said. ""We're working our way up the side of this volcano and all of a sudden it does this big burst and you see this thing the size of a school bus comes crashing down about 150 metres away from us. ""I kind of stop there and we're all quiet—we don't scream or anything, but I look up at the guys, they just kind of shrug their shoulders and keep going … and I'm like: 'Does anybody want to talk about what just happened here?'""Dalton-Smith said he was one of just a handful of foreign journalists in the thick of the devastating volcanic eruptions on Hawaii's Big Island last year. ""Everything around us was on fire, burning … everything was destroyed,"" he said. Despite the damage the torrents of lava did to homes and property, people who had lost everything were still ""talking about the beauty of it, not the destruction"", he said.The locals he met had tremendous respect for the forces around them. ""This beauty, the Earth in its dynamic nature, is right there in front of you and it's an incredible experience to be a be so close to something so powerful,"" he said. He said the rumbling and bubbling of lava lakes were not a concern, but when volcanoes became dead silent, that's when he knew the pressure was building.While volcanoes are revered like deities in many countries, Dalton-Smith described them as more akin to the engine rooms of the Earth.

""We need to protect the lives of our people and we need to protect our planet.""However, he praised the efforts of Ms Ardern's Government who just last week, introduced an ambitious bill that aims to make New Zealand mostly carbon neutral by 2050 while giving some leeway to farmers.In Fiji, Mr Guterres will meet with PIF leaders and senior government officials from the region.Samoa's Prime Minister Tuilepa Sailele, a leading critic against nations who he believes are ignoring the threats of climate change, told the ABC's Pacific Beat program that he had a message for Mr Guterres.""To impress on him the importance of the smallness of our islands, and the quicker moves that our vulnerable islands would like to see from the bigger countries responsible for all these problems that we are facing today,"" he said.Mr Sailele, who has previously blasted countries for ignoring the warnings, added that rising sea levels is not just an issue for the Pacific, but for those very same ""bigger countries"" as well.""With America for example, or Australia — Sydney could go down,"" he said.His comments follow a controversial withdrawal from the Paris Agreement's commitments by United States President Donald Trump in 2017, a move that was praised by former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott who last year said that Canberra should do the same.The secretary-general's Pacific trip comes ahead of an anticipated Climate Action Summit that he plans to convene in September in New York.ABC/wires","Climate Change, Climate Change - Disasters, Environment, Environmental Policy, Fiji, New Zealand, Pacific, Samoa, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2019-05-13T04:38:08+00:00

""It has the right levels of sunshine, the right levels of overall climatic conditions,"" Mr Tindall said.""For us to produce yields that are similar would require a greenhouse in Australia and North America.""He said cultivating the marijuana used in the trials in Vanuatu would also help to reduce costs.On March 5, Martin Tindall and representatives from Vanuatu's Ministry of Health held a ceremony to open a new Phoenix Life Sciences clinic in the country's capital, Port Vila.The clinic currently provides free diabetes checks and health consultations for the local community in Erakor village.It's the first of a number of clinics the company plans to open across Vanuatu to eventually provide and trial cannabis-based drugs on diabetics.""We actually started working with the Government of Vanuatu [to develop trialling policies and legislation] about four years ago,"" Mr Tindall told Pacific Beat said in March.""One of the reasons that attracted us to Vanuatu was the ability to work through the Dangerous Drugs Act framework.""Vanuatu's Dangerous Drugs Act currently prohibits the importation, cultivation, sale, supply and possession of cannabis.However, the Minister of Health is allowed to issue import permits ""at the request of any duly qualified medical practitioner or pharmacist,"" which has allowed Phoenix Life to begin its operations — importing from a third party — without any changes to Vanuatu's drug laws.In January, Vanuatu's former acting director-general of health Dr Santus Wari was hired as national head of healthcare for Phoenix Life Sciences' operations in Vanuatu.He said amendments to Vanuatu's laws will allow the company to cultivate marijuana in the country.""When the legislation, or the amendments to the Dangerous Drugs Act is passed, it will give us the move to set up a farm,"" Dr Wari said.That legislation is expected to pass Parliament in coming months after Vanuatu's Cabinet — known as the Council of Ministers — issued a directive last year to amend the Act.Phoenix Life Sciences claims that its product, Phoenix Metabolic, uses compounds extracted from the cannabis plant is an effective treatment for diabetes.""We really see ourselves not as a cannabis company, but a healthcare solutions company,"" Mr Tindall said.Ruth Colagiuri, an associate professor at the Menzies Centre for Health Policy in Australia, told Pacific Beat there were concerns about the health claims made by Phoenix Life Sciences.""There is actually no evidence [that] currently [shows] cannabis works in the treatment of diabetes,"" Ms Colagiuri said.""In fact, I think there are very few trials about it so it's mainly used in palliative care.""Usually when you start trialling something or start dispensing it, you have some preliminary evidence that it could be [effective].""In response to this criticism, Phoenix Life Sciences' Mr Tindall said the lack of research was due to the prohibitive regulation of cannabis in many countries.""Part of the reason there hasn't been sufficient clinical studies is because of the restrictions around being able to study cannabis in general,"" he explained.Vanuatu's Ministry of Health has not responded to requests for comment about the work and products of Phoenix.","Health, Laws, Pacific, Science and Technology, United States, Vanuatu, ",2019-04-21T19:02:31+00:00

Supported by private, Chinese-backed investment, it is the biggest residential development in Vanuatu.Australia and the United States have been worried about the growing level of Chinese government interest in Vanuatu and the Pacific more broadly, but private investments from China like Rainbow City are booming.And for locals, it is the most direct source of disquiet and discomfort about the future of their island homes.Behind Rainbow City is one woman, Ruimin Cheng, who has lived in Vanuatu for about 10 years, and is known locally as Amy Feng.She is the head of the Port Vila-based FPF Company, which, as well as developing Rainbow City, runs a weekly newspaper and advises foreigners on Vanuatu's citizenship-by-investment program.Rainbow City, according to Ms Cheng, is part of her efforts to contribute to Vanuatu's economy.""We want to help Vanuatu … open the tourist market, have tourists come here,"" she told the ABC.""People from the whole world will come here … [from] England or Australia, or … China or Hong Kong, Macau.""Although ostensibly aimed at attracting investors from around the world, the marketing and design of the development — which the company has dubbed Little Singapore — is clearly geared towards Asian investment.Preliminary construction has begun, but not a single property has been sold yet, or even put on the market.""A lot of people [are] asking how much to buy,"" Ms Cheng said.""Soon we will make it to market,"" she went on to explain, saying the first property sales were due to take place around the end of the year.In lieu of buyers, the first stages of the development are being funded by Ms Cheng's private companies — some based in Vanuatu, others in China.When pressed, she was vague about how many and which companies were financially backing the project.The concrete wall that rings the Rainbow City site was the first thing to be built and it sits uneasily with ni-Vanuatu, as the people native to the islands of Vanuatu are known.Graham Toara's village neighbours Rainbow City, but proximity has not brought clarity.Although the developers are promising ni-Vanuatu will be able to access the schools and hospital planned as part of the mini city, Mr Toara is suspicious.""When you are talking about a town — town means that there's no wall,"" he said. ""If you build a town, you have to remove the wall.""His frustration and confusion are clear, as he grapples with the prospect of a giant, gated community of foreigners on his doorstep.""We don't understand the Rainbow City, actually. We need the Government to explain it to us,"" he said.""All the Chinese is building this. The community that is living around here, they do not understand."" There is no shortage of resorts and foreign visitors in Vanuatu, with tourism the mainstay of the nation's economy.Vanuatu is made up of more than 80 islands in the South Pacific, east of Townsville and west of Fiji, which makes it a hotspot for travellers seeking quiet, untouched beaches and world-class diving.But this development is of a previously unseen scale and coincides with growing concern about Chinese influence in the region.Mr Toara is emphatic this development is unparalleled in Vanuatu.""Never. Never. Never. I am ni-Vanuatu and I have never seen this before,"" he said.His mother, Gabriel Toara, presses the point, switching from her native Bislama to halting English to get her message across.""Over here, and up there, and the other side,"" she said, pointing out where different Chinese investors had purchased land around her family's village.""They try to buy here, but my son doesn't want. He come to the land and stop them, not allow [them] to buy here because this is my land.""""We worry how the Chinese come and build house and buy everyplace in Vanuatu and we didn't understand why they buy Vanuatu.""Anxiety around Chinese-backed development in the Pacific is not new, but it is heightened, given the renewed focus on the region by the world's great powers.The vast oceanic territory under the control of the island nations through their exclusive economic zones — and their strategically advantageous mid-ocean locations — has thrust the Pacific back onto the radar of China and the United States, as well as their allies.Last year, US and Australian officials were alarmed at the prospect of China establishing a permanent military presence in Vanuatu, despite both countries strenuously denying such talks ever took place.The Chinese-funded redevelopment of Vanuatu's Luganville port did little to assuage their concerns.Vanuatu is already one of the biggest recipients of China's largesse in the Pacific, according to a comprehensive analysis of aid to the Pacific by the Lowy Institute. Their Pacific Aid Map shows China donated almost twice as much to Vanuatu as Australia through $US99.65 million ($145 million) in grants and concessional loans.That money paid for the redevelopment of the Luganville wharf along with smaller projects, such as building new offices for the Prime Minister, President, and the Foreign Affairs and Finance ministries.However, Australia remains the biggest single national contributor of aid to the Pacific, having spent $1.2 billion across the region.New Zealand and Japan still outrank China in aid committed to the region, too. Diplomatic officials from both Australia and the US have told the ABC they are concerned China's strategic lending will lead to ""debt-trap diplomacy"", though some experts have recently cautioned against overstating such concerns.While nations that rim the Pacific jostle for influence across the ocean, on the islands and atolls the concern reaches into everyday life. Developments like Rainbow City hold the promise of jobs and training for ni-Vanuatu, but locals tell a different story.John Bakoa lives on a property just down the road from Rainbow City and worked on the construction site, helping to build the perimeter wall.""They don't pay us well,"" he said. ""They pay us 130 vatu … per hour.""That is about $1.70 in Australian terms, and is well below Vanuatu's minimum wage.Ms Cheng vociferously disputes this, saying full-time workers on the site are paid a ""good and high salary"" that is ""always over"" the minimum wage, although it is not clear if that applies to casual workers too.Locals are also worried Chinese workers will either refuse to buy fruit and vegetables from them, or undercut them at markets.Mr Bakoa acknowledges his former workplace has the potential to bring investment and infrastructure that will benefit ni-Vanuatu as well as foreigners.""The Chinese have a lot of money they bring in,"" he said, but Mr Bakoa does not see it helping those around him.""The work conditions aren't great, they push you really hard and then you only get a bit of money in return,"" he said.The need for assistance and development is high, but so is the desire to retain control and national identity Mr Bakoa is unsettled by the changes on his island home.""I hear that … lots of people could be helped by the development."" ""But I'm not really sure. You know, because it's Chinese, they have their ideas. We don't really understand it.""","China, Government and Politics, Pacific, Tourism and Leisure Industry, Travel and Tourism (Lifestyle and Leisure), Urban Development and Planning, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2019-10-23T19:02:33+00:00

It is proper AFL rules but with just nine on the field at any point in time.""In Geneva the game is played on a smaller rugby field, using rugby goals for one set of goals along with some homemade point posts.""I think the skill level is surprisingly high,"" Ms Dellar said.""What's really nice about it is that there is such a mix of age ranges. In the Geneva team we have people in their 50s and teenagers and everything in between.""You have some players who are slightly more skilled, slightly more fit, but the standard and the spirit in which we play means that people of all skill levels can get involved.""It's quite a small field so there's a lot of sharing the ball around.""While the Geneva team is made up of almost all Australian expats, there is a player from Canada who spent his teenage years playing the game in Ontario and British Columbia.Many of the Winterthur players are former rugby players who have been taught Australian Rules by an Australian/Swiss dual national who developed a love the game while living in Australia as a child.Swiss teacher Ulrike Senti, 24, fell in love with Australian Rules when she studied abroad in Tasmania a few years ago.She wanted to continue playing once she returned to Europe and after a long search, she discovered the Winterthur Lions team.Ms Senti is now the head of women's development for AFL Switzerland.""It's a really challenging game but that's what I love about it,"" she said.""No-one is perfect at the beginning, you just need to practice and it needs different skills which is why I really like it.""You not only have to run fast but you have to get to know the ball's bounce. Handballing is also a big challenge for people from Europe because were not used to a bouncing ball.""Ms Senti said having Australian teammates playing in the Swiss league reminded her of life in Tasmania.""It is awesome to have Aussies in terms of footy and also in terms of my language,"" she said.""I'm still practicing talking to them and getting to know Australian culture even better.""I already fell in love with Australia when I was in Tasmania so that's why I really enjoy my job.""According to the AFL there are 4,487 participants playing in Europe and 1,165 of those are female.More than 180,000 people play outside of Australia and 44 per cent of those players are women.The countries with the biggest female participation are Papua New Guinea, South Africa and the South Pacific Nations.The Australian Football International Cup has been held in Melbourne every three years since 2002 and features a men's and women's competition.An all-female Australian Rules tournament, the Gallia Cup, was held in France on March 9 and saw teams from Germany, England and France and the Netherlands take part.Ms Senti was part of a group of Swiss women who combined forces with some German players to field a side in the Cup.They ended up winning the tournament.""It was the first all-women's competition that we have seen,"" Ms Dellar said.""In the past couple of years the women's element has been growing rapidly.""I certainly think AFL seems to be giving some European women the opportunity to get involved in sport where they might not have otherwise had that opportunity because you don't really see much of it around to be honest."" Both Ms Dellar and Ms Senti hope to see an all-women's competition established in Switzerland.""The mixed comp is great at the moment, but the dream would be to have individual women's teams from different cities that can play against each other,"" Ms Dellar said.""Hopefully this tournament in Paris has generated some momentum and certainly one of the next exciting things on the horizon is the Euro Cup.""The Euro Cup is an annual nine-a-side tournament in which national sides face-off to contest for the title of champions of Europe. The 2019 event will be held in Norrtalje, Sweden.""The Swiss men's team played last year and for the first time we will be sending a women's team,"" Ms Dellar said.""We will see how that goes in terms of generating a bit of publicity for AFL in Switzerland, particularly for the women.""","Australian National University, Australian Rules Football, Canada, Canberra, England, Fiji, France, Germany, Nauru, Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Perth, Samoa, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sport, Sport Event, Sports Organisations, Sweden, Switzerland, Tonga, Vanuatu, Winter Sports, ",2019-03-19T19:13:38+00:00

Estimates of how much the country spends on chocolate for the occasion run anywhere from $US500 million ($701 million) to over $1 billion dollars each year, with chocolatiers releasing exclusive editions and limited edition flavours in the lead-up to February. But cocoa growers on three volcano islands across Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and the Philippines seem set to reap the benefits of Japan's chocolate obsession this year, with Nestle Japan using their crops for a special series of ""volcanic"" Kit Kat bars.Cedric Lacroix from Nestle Japan's confectionary arm said the idea to use cocoa grown on volcanic islands came about as they were looking to different parts of world to find cocoa.""We came about these particular islands where cocoa trees are growing on volcanic soil which gives them fantastic taste, first and foremost and also a nice story to consumers,"" he said.Barbara Goodyear, the owner of one of the volcanic cocoa plantations on PNG's Karkar Island, said the sudden interest in her crop couldn't have come at a better time.The last few years have been tough for farmers on the island because of a tiny menace called the cocoa pod borer — a moth that lays its eggs on the cocoa pod, with the larvae then tunnelling inside, eventually destroying the beans.""It's actually still on the island, it still affects us a lot,"" Ms Goodyear said.She estimated her plantation lost between 50 and 60 per cent of last year's harvest to the borer, but there is hope supplying cocoa for the volcanic chocolates will help to turn things around. ""If we can sell more to them for a really good price then we can actually give the money back to our harvesters, or to the communities around us with schools or health services,"" Ms Goodyear said.Nestle has previously come under fire from environmental groups for its use of palm oil — last year it was suspended from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil for breaching the group's code of conduct. But Mr Lacroix said the company aims to ethically source its cocoa for Kit Kat chocolate bars.""Kit Kat was and is actually still the only global brand, and definitely was the first global brand, going for fully traceable and ethical cocoa under what we call the Nestle cocoa plan, and this Nestle volcanic chocolate goes along these lines,"" he said.

165,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-19/scott-morrison-and-bill-shorten-2019-federal-election/10726664,"The first big political messages for what will be a torrid year were out there for all to see this week.Prime Minister Scott Morrison was in the Pacific, making perhaps the most significant rapprochement with Fiji in decades, and telling Vanuatu that we were reliable friends, no matter how friendly the Chinese might have been there lately.There were agreements on everything from defence to football and, significantly from an economic perspective, Fiji's entry into the Pacific labour scheme.Along the way, Mr Morrison had to listen to the complaints in the Pacific about climate change. But if you lead a party that finds it impossible to endorse a credible climate and energy policy, them's the breaks.But for Australian political junkies, there was of course another implicit message in the PM's trip: no early election, thank you very much.The Prime Minister was busy with the task of running the country and its international relations, and would keep doing so, was the clear point.Certainly, the ""early"" election speculation (i.e. call it on Australia Day or even before) that had built up in political Canberra as it broke for Christmas has now faded, and most people seem resigned to the Government hanging on until the April budget and going after that, in the dim hope that something turns up to improve its electoral prospects.The other big political message came from Opposition Leader Bill Shorten: Queensland.It is true that Queensland, in recent decades, has often played a central role in federal elections.But it is hard to think of a recent campaign where so many seats genuinely felt up for grabs by Labor, not just as interesting because of the One Nation vote.Mr Shorten launched a ""fair dinkum"" bus tour of the Sunshine State on Thursday and will spend the next nine days heading north.The electorates he is visiting are instructive as you start to get your mind around the looming federal election.Mr Shorten is starting in the seat of Forde, which has been held by the LNP's Bert Van Manen since 2010. But the two-party preferred margin was sliced by 3.75 per cent at the last election to a vote of just 50.63 per cent in 2016.The Opposition Leader then travels though Fisher, Wide Bay and Hinkler (held by the LNP on margins of more than 8 per cent).Then it's back into much more marginal territory: Flynn, where Ken O'Dowd clung on to the seat with just 1,814 votes despite a 5.5 per cent two party preferred swing Labor, and Capricornia, where Michelle Landry's margin is just over 1000 votes.It's a mish mash of apparently safe and marginal seats, topped off with a likely visit to George Christensen's seat of Dawson, held with a margin of just 3.34 per cent, and Herbert, held narrowly by Labor's Cathy O'Toole.The Opposition Leader argues he is visiting Queensland seats regardless of Labor's chances.But he also needs to be seen up north, where the Government believes his personal appeal is the weakest.Of course, many in the LNP blame the significant swings against it in 2016 on Malcolm Turnbull, and much of the pressure to remove the former prime minister was driven by nervous Queensland MPs.So the dynamics of this election will be very different: the optics of a government that is clearly fractured and which, despite removing Mr Turnbull, doesn't seem to have landed in voters' minds in any clear philosophical territory that guarantees success in those LNP seats.As if to prove the point, Scott Morrison is also expected to spend next week in Queensland — though he will be starting his travels in the far north, rather than the south.Federal Cabinet is also expected to meet in Queensland in the following week.The Government's woes, however, will continue to be affected by the day to day business of government, or government failures.There's the aged care royal commission and the massive fish kills in the Murray Darling, for starters.We know from the banking royal commission that the way these things operate is that the major parties slug out the news from a royal commission as a straight forward blame game.And the fact the Government has suddenly felt compelled to do something about the excessive use of chemical constraints on aged care residents — after horrendous footage on ABC's 7.30 report this week, and on the eve of the royal commission — when it has had official recommendations on this dating back 18 months shows the pitfalls.It has sounded unpersuasive on the fish kill issue too, even if it is true that extreme weather and drought hasn't helped, and that the Murray Darling is an issue for both state and territory governments.For the fish kill brings us into the territory of both climate change policy and the Nationals' history on the issue of water — specifically that of Barnaby Joyce's time as water minister.And the increasingly unhappy relationship between the Liberals and the Nats — both in the pressure they have brought on the major Coalition partner to shift on both social and environmental issues, and in the increasing Nationals alarm at the declining fortunes of the Liberal Party — is likely to continue to play out, and in some cases be amplified, in the looming election.Retiring, or resigning, Coalition MPs have left open the door to three-cornered contests in a number of seats (there is an agreement between the Coalition parties that they will not run against each other in seats where one has a sitting member).That's brought the seats of Cowper, Indi, and Mallee into play.Former independent Rob Oakeshott is running in Cowper; the Coalition will be trying to win back Indi from the independent vote of Cathy McGowan, who is retiring in favour of a candidate she and her Voices for Indi group have endorsed, Helen Haines.There's a four-way contest for the traditional bellwether seat of Eden-Monaro, and there is still a formal question mark over whether former Abbott chief of staff Peta Credlin will run for the Liberals in Mallee, and whether the Nationals' Bridget McKenzie will run in Indi, making that a three-cornered contest, too.A quiet deal to trade off these contests remains possible.The implications that all, or even some, of these seats would change hands in an election in which current expectations are for a massive national swing against a stumbling government do not seem largeBut at the least they will require attention and some of the Coalition's exceptionally thin resources.They will only highlight the tensions within the Coalition parties in the meantime.And, after all, it was those tensions that were the big political message of 2018.Laura Tingle is 7.30's chief political correspondent.","Agriculture, Australia, Climate Change, Climate Change - Disasters, Federal Election, Federal Elections, Federal Government, Fiji, Government and Politics, Pacific, Rural, Vanuatu, ",2019-01-18T19:00:26+00:00

Clearly, there should be no kava for sale in Australia. There should be no allowable amount in Australia, and we should recognise the vast damage that this is doing to Aboriginal people in Arnhem Land,"" Senator Scullion told The Australian. Northern Territory police say the majority of offenders who are caught trafficking kava into the NT are Pacific Islanders.""The Northern Territory is in a unique situation as the North East Arnhem Land area is the only location in Australia that has the level of abuse of this substance or the criminal activity that supports the distribution, sale and misuse of kava,"" a statement on NT police website reads.Aboriginal leaders throughout Arnhem Land have been outspoken on the damage excessive kava consumption has had on Indigenous Australians, such as a zombie-like persona, and even sudden death.Mr Morrison said he did not want to see the importation of kava create problems for Indigenous communities, and that he believed the issue could be managed.""Well look this is important to Vanuatu,"" he said.""I think we've just got to be practical about this. ""We'll work up the details, we'll be careful about how we proceed.""We want to remove unnecessary obstacles to what is a valuable export market for Vanuatu.""At the moment, people are allowed to bring up to 2 kilograms into Australia from Pacific Island nations for personal use.""It's a very modest amount that comes in [at the moment] which is hardly going to manage one family gathering in Western Sydney,"" Mr Morrison said.But in the Territory, particularly in East Arnhem Land, a more rigorous regulatory process still remains.Acting Health Minister Eva Lawler said ""continuing to police a restriction on kava is an important part of this for some regions"".""Kava has the potential to cause significant health and social issues, as we have seen in remote Territory communities in the past,"" she said.Kava comes from the root of a pepper plant, once crushed into a powder, it's drunk with water for it's relaxing and slightly numbing effect.","Canberra, Darwin, Drug Offences, Drugs, Foreign Affairs, Nhulunbuy, Politics and Government, Vanuatu, ",2019-01-17T19:32:31+00:00

It is obvious that cyclones are destructive storms that are difficult to predict, but why do they move around so bizarrely and why are they difficult to forecast? BOM meteorologist Jackson Browne said some cyclones were well-behaved while others were not.""Research has shown that in the Australian region, cyclones exhibit more erratic paths than cyclones in other cyclone basins,"" he said.Mr Browne said small changes in the initial environment surrounding a cyclone could make large differences in its eventual path, making it harder to predict its movement because it is difficult to work out exactly what the conditions are at sea.""Compared to land areas the oceans don't have a lot of observations,"" he said.""This data is valuable to numerical computer models and makes it harder for them to accurately predict paths.""Accuracy of model predictions decrease the longer the forecast time, so the apparent spread in where a cyclone might travel to is also large.""Mr Browne said a tropical cyclone is like a cork in a stream as it is pushed and pulled along by the winds that surround it.Fledgling cyclones are controlled by lower to mid-levels of the atmosphere, but mature cyclones, by virtue of being deeper and stronger systems, tend to be steered by winds over a greater depth, according to Mr Browne.He said because cyclones are rotating storms on a rotating planet, they have an inherent and very small motion towards the poles and to the west, but they can also be influenced by low and high pressure systems as they move through.""U-turns, wobbles, loops and near-stationary dwelling are all possible,"" Mr Browne said.""Slow-moving tropical cyclones tend to exhibit these erratic behaviours, while faster-moving cyclones are under a stronger steering pattern and move around closer to a straight line.""Very rarely, tropical cyclones can interact with other tropical cyclones and become engaged in a spiral or orbit around one another, known as the Fujiwhara Effect.""Usually the larger circulation will win out and absorb the smaller one.""Cyclone Oma was a classic example of an erratic path which left even the experts unsure of where it would go next. The system first grabbed headlines when it brought torrential rain to north Queensland as part of the monsoon trough in February 2019. It settled over central Queensland for more than a week and caused devastating floods before finally moving east and into the Coral Sea. A few weeks later it intensified into a tropical cyclone near New Caledonia and started moving south-east towards the Queensland coast. Initially the BOM said it would likely move south-east over New Zealand, but a few days later the chances of it crossing low on the Queensland coast near the population centres of Brisbane, the Gold and Sunshine coasts increased. Eventually the southern Queensland coast was issued with a cyclone watch and there was coastal flooding and high winds, but Oma weakened and swung north without crossing the coast. Earlier in the same season, Cyclone Owen barrelled across Cape York peninsula from east to west before doing a U-turn in the Gulf of Carpentaria and crossing the coast from west to east.There was speculation and modelling that suggested the system would travel all the way down the Queensland coast, however this didn't eventuate.","Brisbane, Bundaberg, Cairns, Coffs Harbour, Cyclone, Cyclones, Darwin, Earth Sciences, Floods, Mackay, Maroochydore, Mermaid Beach, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Oceans and Reefs, Perth, Rain, Storm Event, Storms, Sydney, Townsville, Vanuatu, Weather, ",2019-02-18T19:02:24+00:00

Vanuatu's Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu announced the plan as part of broader changes that will ban a range of plastic products. ""Eliminating [nappies] alone will disproportionately reduce plastic waste,"" he said.But the news has sparked mixed reactions, with some locals taking to social media to praise the idea while others questioning how it would be implemented. ""Vanuatu ahead of the times — well done,"" one user wrote on FacebookBut cost and accessibility are clearly issues, with another Facebook user voicing concern about the feasibility of reusable options in the more remote parts of Vanuatu outside of capital city Port Vila.""Cloth nappies, waterproofs, T-clamps and nappy liners are very difficult to buy in developing countries,"" they wrote. ""Port Vila has some but what about the outer islands?""Belinda Rosselli from local NGO Mama's Laef said she was working on a prototype reusable nappy. ""I'm trying to work out what fabrics will work best in Vanuatu because of heat,"" she said. Mama's Laef has successfully produced reusable women's sanitary products, and while reusable nappies are already widely produced, Ms Roselli is concerned current designs could hurt babies. ""We know that there are babies [being brought forward] across Vanuatu with [navel] issues caused by the synthetic materials used in blankets, [and] the same sort of fabrics are widely used as a liner in reusable diapers,"" she said.""So I'm looking at more cotton-based [fabrics] and other components that will be kind to the baby's skin.""Disposable nappies are a global environmental problem, with an estimated 450 billion used annually. In Australia, the environmental group Boomerang Alliance has calculated that 3.75 million nappies get used every day of the week. ""That's a lot of babies, a lot of bottoms, and a lot of nappies,"" Jayne Paramor, the alliance's deputy director, told Pacific Mornings.""Somewhere around 800 million disposable nappies are going into landfills every year because we don't have an alternative.""Ms Paramor said disposable nappies now account for at least one per cent of Australian landfill.""We've been led down a path where we believe disposable is easier, and the environmental consequences are starting to bite,"" she said. To date, nappy bans have been touted in other parts of world: last year the UK's Environment Secretary Michael Gove hinted at one ,but was forced to step back on his statement after a community backlash. Ms Paramor said despite growing concern about plastic pollution, Australia was unlikely to follow Vanuatu's lead.""No, I don't think we are going to see a ban,"" she said.""I think we will first [find] better ways to manage the waste … and keep them out of landfills.""Ms Paramor said it was important to recognise disposable nappies were once a life-changing tool for women, but better designs are now needed to improve the recyclability of disposable options. ""These days there are fewer and fewer stay-at-home mums, so I think that convenience factor was a huge part of enabling women to go back into the workforce easily and resume their careers,"" she said.""As a woman I would never stand in the way of that benefit, so we need to do a better [job of] designing the material — using and reclaiming and re-utilising them.""We [should] have the best of both worlds: women [should] have the convenience without necessarily doing things that are of detriment to the planet.""","Babies, Environment, Pacific, Recycling and Waste Management, Vanuatu, ",2019-03-21T19:05:29+00:00

170,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-19/using-drones-to-deliver-crucial-vaccines-to-remote-vanuatu/10728350,"In war-torn parts of the world, the distant whine of a drone can signal death and destruction.But on the Pacific island of Erromango the sound means help has arrived. We're standing in a tiny village called South River. It's perched on Erromango's west coast, in the nation of Vanuatu. It's impossibly beautiful. Rainforest giants tower over simple, immaculate huts. A crystal clear river loops past lazily. You hear it well before you see it. It's an angry, insistent buzz which blossoms into something like a roar. Then suddenly the drone screams into view. It soars above you with improbable speed before stopping and beginning a slow, careful descent.It comes to rest in a lurid green field littered with cow pats. It's a strange and alien looking thing, a collection of right angles with small, furiously whirring blades. But it's bearing precious cargo: vaccines for children.Vanuatu is a hard country for the workers charged with making sure every child is protected from diseases like measles, hepatitis and tuberculosis. It has more than 80 islands sprawling over a vast stretch of the Pacific. Many are mountainous and sparsely populated. At the moment about one in five children in Vanuatu don't get all the vaccines they need. And it's not hard to see why. Nurses who vaccinate children often have to walk for hours or days to reach remote communities connected by nothing but muddy walking trails. Len Tarivonda, Vanuatu's Director of Public Health, says the challenges are formidable. ""Many of the communities in Vanuatu on larger islands are quite isolated. There are small pockets of communities here and there with no access to roads, perhaps no access to telecommunications or air links,"" he says. If you want to get a sense of the magnitude of this isolation, try travelling to South River. First you take a small plane from Vanuatu's capital Port Vila, landing on a runway carved out of Erromango's jungle. Then you drive down a dirt road — one of just two on the island — to the island's largest village, William's Bay. Finally, you get on a small motor boat for a bone-jarring two-hour ride down a rugged coastline, before turning into the sheltered inlet where South River sits. The trip is tiring — but it's a luxury most locals here can't afford. If they want to get anywhere they have to walk. For days. That means they face long, exhausting treks if they want to take their children to see a nurse to get their child vaccinated. Nurses do hike to South River with vaccines stored in cold boxes on their backs, but delays are inevitable.And Cate Heinrich from UNICEF says nurses sometimes bring the wrong vaccines because communication with parents here is so difficult.""The local nurses sometimes reach villages with the vaccines that they think are needed, but other children have come in,"" she says. ""The records might not be up to date because it's so hard to get into these villages.""That's where the drones come in. The drone which soared into South River took about 20 minutes to cover the distance which our boat covered in two hours.It can travel at more than 100 kilometres an hour, and costs about $4 an hour (in battery power) to run. This marvel was built and developed by an Australian company called Swoop Aero, which is run by twenty-somethings in a rush to make a difference. Swoop Aero co-founder Eric Peck brims with restless energy. He's a drone evangelist — and he believes their time has come. ""It's something that has been around for quite a while now, but we're at this inflection point where for the first time we are seeing the cost of the technology get down to a point where it's economically efficient to use it,"" he says. ""And people are getting used to drones being in the air space and being around them. So there's a social willingness to allow them to be used.""For now, this is only a trial. Swoop Aero has been contracted by Vanuatu's Government, and the program is being funded by UNICEF and the Australian Government.What's being tested is whether this radical new solution is both practical and cost effective — and whether it can be scaled up.The South River drone contains a small esky nestled in its body. Inside that are a host of vaccines, including a measles and rubella vaccine which will soon be injected into a little girl called Noeline. When the local nurse jabs her in the thigh she barely winces, drawing a small smile of relief from her mother, Sarah. Sarah is shy. She's unaccustomed to strangers, and agrees to talk with a touch of reluctance. But she becomes more animated when asked if the drones have made her life easier in the few weeks since this trial began. ""Before the drones came we would have to take babies and walk to the main village to see someone [for vaccines],"" she says through a translator. She's talking about William's Bay, where our boat set off. How long would that walk take?""I would have to get up and walk for one day or two days to get there,"" she replies. That's in one direction. So the round trip? About four days. And it's not just mothers who are spared the trek. The drones could potentially improve health care in villages like South River by allowing nurses to spend more time helping the sick, and less time hiking from hamlet to hamlet to offer vaccines. It's no wonder people in Vanuatu are starting to dream about a future full of magnificent flying machines spiriting every conceivable good from village to village in record time. This trial hasn't finished yet, and Vanuatu's Government is keen to stress they will not get swept up in enthusiasm. They will study Swoop Aero's performance carefully before they commit to expanding the program. But Mr Tarivonda confesses that some of his colleagues in other ministries are already starting to hatch plans. ""For example in a place like this, in South River, when it comes to election time, ballot papers need to be dispatched to all communities, even in isolated areas,"" he says.Why not use drones? Not long ago that might have sounded like a mad fantasy.But after you've stood in a field on a speck of an island and watched a drone lift itself effortlessly into the sky before screaming out of sight in a heartbeat? It just sounds like the near future.","Diseases and Disorders, Foreign Aid, Health, Science and Technology, Vanuatu, ",2019-01-18T22:12:37+00:00

A loan is a loan. It needs to be repaid. Given the Pacific's debt is already about $5.5 billion, including $2 billion to the Asian Development Bank and World Bank, and $1.5 billion to Beijing, why are we even contemplating saddling our neighbours with more debt?""""The reality is that lending another $2 billion to countries whose external debt to GDP ratios range from 25 per cent to 90 per cent means those debts are unlikely to be repaid,"" she wrote.Ms Fierravanti-Wells also took a shot at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) for ""driving"" the Government's policy to this decision.""Or is it a ploy by 'fellow travellers' in DFAT to place Australia in a compromised position, thus making it more difficult to call out Beijing when it engages in conduct that is not consistent with being a good international citizen?"" she said.Mr Morrison is in the middle of a state visit to Vanuatu and Fiji in a bid to reaffirm Australia's commitment and ties with some of its closest neighbours. The visit follows increasing tensions between Australia and several of its South Pacific neighbours over China's increasing presence in the region, including its extensive aid and loan programs.In a joint statement with Vanuatu Prime Minister Charlot Salwai, Mr Morrison said the $2 billion Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility (AIFFP) would support ""high priority"" telecommunications, energy, transport and water infrastructure projects through grants and long-term loans. Mr Morrison first announced the AIFFP in November.Mr Morrison rejected Senator Fierravanti-Wells' criticism. ""I don't agree with the perspective that she's offered,"" he said. ""I would agree with the perspective that has been shared with me, not just by Pacific leaders across the region but our allies and partners well beyond our region. ""The Pacific step-up program has been incredibly well received.""One of the things we can do as a nation that has a partnership with Fiji and other nations in the Pacific is work on projects that are bankable, work on projects that actually can support that type of finance, that we don't allow projects to go ahead in that program which can't support those types of financing arrangements."" Shadow Minister for foreign Affairs Penny Wong has labelled the fund ""disingenuous"", saying it would do little to repair Australia's relationship with the South Pacific after the Government's failure to address climate change in the region.""No issue has done more damage to Australia's standing in the region than the Coalition's refusal to take seriously the issue of climate change,"" she said in a statement.""A quick trip by [Mr] Morrison to the Pacific after years of his government's neglect of these critical relationships isn't going to fix that.""Dr Michael O'Keefe, an international relations academic from La Trobe University, told the ABC that many South Pacific countries preferred taking on debt from China's long-term loan program rather than accept Australian grants because there was less red tape involved.""Australian aid has been conditional and involved regular reporting aspects which are considered to be onerous, so concessional loans allows China to provide money in a more free flowing manner to these Pacific Island countries,"" Dr O'Keefe said.He added Ms Fierravanti-Wells's comments were an ""amazing example of ill discipline"" within the Liberal Party and appeared to be designed to embarrasses Mr Morrison.Ms Fierravanti-Wells quit her ministerial role during the Government's last leadership challenge in August amid concerns she was being prevented from publicly denouncing China's growing influence in the South Pacific.Last year government officials privately accused China of trying to win favour from South Pacific countries by funding projects which funnel money directly to leaders in the region.Aid is an important resource for the Pacific Islands region, but public information is often lacking. The Lowy Institute Pacific Aid Map is designed to enhance aid effectiveness.Ms Fierravanti-Wells claimed China was funding the construction of ""useless buildings"" in the Pacific.Her replacement, South Australian senator Anne Ruston, was only appointed as an assistant minister, sparking further criticism from Ms Fierravanti-Wells that the portfolio being downgraded was sending ""the wrong signal at a time when we are spending record amounts of overseas development assistance in the Pacific"".Ms Fierravanti-Wells told the ABC her comments reflected her long-term concern about the region's debt levels.When asked if the timing of her comments was to ""embarrass"" Mr Morrison during his Pacific visit, she maintained it was an issue she raised consistently. ""I am very pleased to see Scott Morrison going to the Pacific, and especially to countries like Vanuatu and Fiji which have in the past been devastated by cyclones and where I believe our spending should be focused,"" she said. Ms Fierravanti-Wells said funds would firstly be better spent in weather-proofing key infrastructure such as schools, community halls and hospitals through an independent fund ""where Australia could contribute to its capitalisation"", and secondly supporting private sector investment. She added in her opinion piece that although many South Pacific countries urgently need to update and build new infrastructure to support their economies and increase health and education standards, additional debt was simply not the answer.""Our efforts should be directed into mobilising private-sector capital and supporting investments effectively as a guarantor,"" she wrote. ""It is vital they not be saddled with heavy debt burdens.""The ABC has contacted DFAT for comment.","Asia, Australia, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, Pacific, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2019-01-17T01:28:16+00:00
172,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-14/scott-morrison-historic-vanuatu-fiji-state-visit/10712212,"Scott Morrison has returned from summer holidays with a herculean political challenge looming — in only a few months he'll take his Coalition Government to the polls and try to pull off an unlikely election victory.But the Prime Minister won't spend his first week back touring marginal seats or locked in strategic conclaves with his advisers.Instead, he'll kick off 2019 by jetting to the Pacific island nations of Vanuatu and Fiji for a state visit.In a small way, Mr Morrison is making history.Australian prime ministers typically spend much more time flying over the Pacific than visiting it.While they often jet into the region to attend annual Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders meetings, formal bilateral trips like this are almost unheard of.No Australian PM has visited Vanuatu since 1990, when Bob Hawke attended the PIF leaders meeting. John Howard went to Fiji back in 2006 for the same reason.Australian National University academic and former diplomat James Batley — who has represented Australia in several Pacific nations — says there's powerful symbolism at play.""It's extremely unusual for an Australian prime minister to make a bilateral visit of this nature. It's a very important signal,"" he said.And it doesn't come out of nowhere.Last year the Morrison Government made a series of high-profile promises as part of its Pacific ""step up"", including a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure bank, several new diplomatic posts, and a permanent new Defence training force.It's all part of a concerted push to reassert Australia's influence and centrality in the region, which is being increasingly challenged by new players like China.The Prime Minister's visit is designed to reinforce the message that Australia is taking the Pacific seriously.""It is part of a refocus of our international efforts on our own region and making sure we can have the biggest possible difference,"" Mr Morrison told the ABC's News Breakfast program. ""This is about demonstrating following through on the announcements I made last year, about stepping up our security partnerships, stepping up our economic and cultural partnerships.""And Mr Batley says Mr Morrison might have grasped that in order to do so, he must build a strong personal rapport with his Pacific counterparts.""We have a very strong diplomatic network in the region, but the personal relationships between leaders are absolutely critical to the success of Australia's policies,"" Mr Batley said.So expect Mr Morrison to be greeted with ceremony and goodwill when he touches down in both countries.But there are still stumbling blocks and points of tension — including some that have been conjured out of thin air by the Coalition.Three days after Christmas, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton announced the Government had stripped Islamist extremist Neil Prakash of his Australian citizenship.The Government said it could take this step because Prakash — who's currently sitting in a Turkish jail — inherited Fijian citizenship from his father.But Fijian officials rejected that claim within days, insisting that neither Prakash or his father were ever Fijian citizens, and making it very clear the Islamic State extremist would not be welcome in their country.Some people in the Fijian Government were also quietly flabbergasted that Australia would make the announcement only weeks before Mr Morrison's crucial, and meticulously planned, visit.But Mr Morrison told the ABC that Canberra had been in discussions with Suva over the Prakash debacle.""We have been dealing with that issue between the governments over the last few weeks, including from leader to leader,"" he said.The issue has revived the most damaging caricature of Australia in the Pacific — as a high-handed power contemptuously indifferent to the concerns of its smaller neighbours.Mr Batley says the dispute was ""very untidy"" and showed a ""lack of coordination within the Australian Government"".""It shouldn't have happened in that way. Now it's on the table. They will have to deal with it, one way or the other,"" he said.Still, both Fijian and Australian Government staffers have worked to smooth over the dispute, and Mr Batley predicts it won't overshadow Mr Morrison's trip.""It's not in the interests of either government to have a public spat about it during the Prime Minister's visit,"" Mr Batley said.Australia's unease about the increasing strategic competition in the Pacific is fuelled by military anxieties, particularly the prospect of a Chinese base in the region.There was a mad flurry in Canberra last year when Nine reported that China had approached Vanuatu about establishing a naval base in the country.The claim has been forcefully and repeatedly denied by the Government of Vanuatu, which is a committed member of the Non-Aligned Movement.But Australia has still been working overtime to buttress its security ties with Vanuatu, announcing last year it would help it train more than 300 new police recruits and upgrade the facilities used by Vanuatu's military forces.During this visit, Mr Morrison will open a new police college refurbished with Australian aid money, and there's speculation he might announce the two nations have finished their negotiations on a bilateral security treaty.Pacific observers will also be watching Mr Morrison very closely in Fiji to see if there are any announcements to boost military cooperation.Last year Australia successfully beat China to fund the redevelopment of Fiji's Black Rock camp in Nadi, which is being transformed into a training hub for defence forces around the region.Aid is an important resource for the Pacific Islands region, but public information is often lacking. The Lowy Institute Pacific Aid Map is designed to enhance aid effectiveness.It's possible the base could be used as the centre for the Australian Pacific Security College, which will offer training to senior police and bureaucrats across the region.The Australian Government hopes the college will build a powerful alumni network that will instinctively turns toward Canberra — rather than other capitals — when they want to ensure their security.And while any military announcements will attract headlines, Australia's equally intent on using the Prime Minister's trip to push its economic agenda.So far, Fiji, like Papua New Guinea, has resisted calls to join PACER Plus — a Pacific free trade agreement championed by Australia and New Zealand.Just before last year's election Fijian ministers indicated they were close to signing, but there's been radio silence for the past couple of months.If Mr Morrison can fly home with Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama's signature on PACER Plus then his investment of time in the Pacific will have paid strong dividends.","Australia, Defence and National Security, Fiji, Foreign Affairs, Government and Politics, Pacific, Vanuatu, ",2019-01-13T21:16:25+00:00

One of its founders, Marion Healy, said the Cup ""empowered the next generation about who they are"" and where they came from.And the stories of that are, at times, undoubtedly troubling.Starting in the 1860s, tens of thousands of Pacific Islanders from places including Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands came to Australia to work in indentured labour on plantations in Queensland.Leading expert, Emeritus Professor Clive Moore from the University of Queensland, said while there was evidence that most of the 62,000 people sent to Australia came willingly, and signed contracts to work on the plantations, a small portion was lured or taken forcibly onto the boats — a practice known as blackbirding.""We generally think in the first several years, maybe the first 10 years, from any island, there was a fair degree of illegality and total misunderstanding by the Islanders of what they were getting themselves into,"" he said.When they got here, the working conditions were sometimes dreadful. People were discriminated against and treated like second-class citizens. And about one in 10 died from sickness.""It's the closest Australia ever came to working people in conditions that were very similar to slavery,"" Emeritus Professor Moore said.It is a history that broader Australia is only hearing about now. This is also the case for some of those in the locker room at Browne Park. Another rugby player at the Cup, Alana Doak, has only started in recent years to hear the stories of what her ancestors went through. Rugby league has been one vehicle for learning about her family's past.""It's been through Dad and being at the Kanaka Cup,"" Ms Doak said.""Everybody is talking about what our ancestors went through and we're more aware of what happened.""It's sad.

The program is supported by the United Nations children's charity UNICEF, which is the largest vaccine procurer globally.Chief of UNICEF's Vanuatu field office, Andrew Parker, told the ABC that transporting vaccines was like moving an ""ice block or an ice lolly"" from cold storages to clinics and health centres in warmer, more remote areas.""They have a very narrow band in which they remain viable, between 2 and 8 degrees centigrade,"" he said.""If at any stage along that process the vaccine temperature either drops below or rises above, the vaccine itself can become useless.""If the program expands, drones could deliver the medicine in a matter of hours, rather than what can take days to do by foot. Dominic Viratos is a general nurse from the village of Melsisi on Pentecost Island and is in charge of ordering vaccines from the capital Port Vila to the whole island.""When we get heavy rain, trucks aren't able to pass through and cross the rivers,"" he said. ""In those circumstances, we have to notify officials in Port Vila and tell them to hold the vaccines.""When the medicine arrives, it then has to be distributed to the rest of the island, often by foot, where Mr Viratos said he often had to walk on ""bush roads"" carrying the temperature-regulated boxes full of vaccines.He said he was one of just two staff at his Catholic Mission Hospital, and delivering vaccines by foot meant one person was left to deal with all the patients on their own.""So with the drone, it'll be a big help because it can go deliver the vaccines and come back,"" he said.""I can [then stay back and] help at the health facility instead, seeing to sick people or pregnant mothers who come for help.""Vanuatu's Ministry of Health still needs to grant approval for non-medical professionals to handle the medicines, and the Civil Aviation Authority would need to give approval for the flight paths.Mr Parker said there were ""many 'ifs' along the way with new technology"" and the drones still had to prove to be fit for purpose — but UNICEF is hopeful they could operate in the country. ""Should [the trials] prove promising, then certainly the results will be of interest to many of the Pacific Island countries that face similar logistical challenges,"" he said.","Family and Relationships, Health, Pacific, Science and Technology, Vaccines and Immunity, Vanuatu, ",2018-10-29T19:06:44+00:00

We try to send things in proportion so you can play a proper game with it, and we have another 30 sets at home ready to go.""Now Ms Williams has been named as a Community Champion by Cricket Australia, as part of its campaign to highlight efforts to improve the sport at a grassroots level.What began with a few Google searches by Ms Williams has since grown into an international project.""I got hold of Northern Territory Cricket to start with and there was a lovely young fellow there who went out to Indigenous communities and ran clinics,"" Ms Williams said.""He'd take our gear out with him and run clinics for a week and leave our kit behind so the kids had something to go with.""More recently, Ms Williams contacted the former captain of the Bangladesh team, Aminul Islam, who agreed to distribute the donated cricket gear for her.""That's the hardest part for us. We can get it there but then there's nowhere to send it to. It's very difficult to organise transport and all those sorts of things,"" she said.Ms Williams said she understood the financial burden but also the great importance of junior cricket.""It is a slightly exclusive sport from the cost point of view. You do have to have a fair bit of gear to play,"" she said.""I've got four sons so there's a lot of hand-me-downs that can go on.""While Natarsha Williams' efforts have seen second-hand cricket gear find a new use abroad, closer to home research is underway to determine the economic barriers for participating in sport.In September Western Sydney University released a survey of 696 people in New South Wales, finding respondents spent on average $2,000 a year on sport, with some reporting increasing registration costs.The research team, including the university's director for academic program in accounting, Michelle Cull, is now planning to extend the survey to form a broader national picture.Dr Cull said the affordability of each sporting code depended on the region and its socio-economic status, with the average cost of cricket per season reaching $1,142.""We had a lot of comments from respondents who talked about the facilities sometimes not being up to scratch, particularly in more rural areas, and that they had to travel a long way to participate,"" she said.""A lot of the cost can then fall on to the club itself if the council isn't able to maintain the facility at the right level.""Dr Cull said the cost difference in cricket was similar for teenage children and adults, with registration averaging $170 per person.""But uniforms and footwear actually added up to a lot more than registration,"" she said.""For primary-aged children [cricket] costs seem to be a fair bit lower, but it was once they reached high school it seemed to really escalate with most sports.""Dr Cull said greater transparency from sporting clubs and codes around the real cost of signing up would help families plan ahead and that the Government should consider providing more assistance.""Some people would sign up and pay their $100 registration and … then they're told there's another few hundred dollars they have to pay plus they've got to buy their uniforms and equipment,"" she said.""In terms of planning, if you've got a big family, you need to know what the costs are so that you can budget for it.""""Seventy-five per cent [of respondents] said a tax deduction would be great and 68 per cent said a tax rebate [would ease the financial burden].""Dr Cull said Western Sydney University was still seeking participants in its national survey and that results should be released next year.","Ballarat, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Consumer Finance, Cricket, Exercise and Fitness, Family, NT, Sports Organisations, University of Western Sydney, Vanuatu, Wendouree, ",2018-11-19T19:55:57+00:00

According to Chinese state media, the ship has 300 beds, eight operating theatres, and can conduct 60 surgeries in a day.The Peace Ark said it has so far provided free medical treatment to more than 4,000 people in PNG's capital Port Moresby, 4,500 people in Vanuatu, 6,000 in Fiji and more than 5,500 patients in Tonga.In smaller nations with strained health care systems, that is a significant figure.And both the tempo and scale of these humanitarian missions are increasing as strategic competition heats up in the Pacific.China is not the only nation using its navy as a public diplomacy tool.Aid is an important resource for the Pacific Islands region, but public information is often lacking. The Lowy Institute Pacific Aid Map is designed to enhance aid effectiveness.Last week the Indian frigate INS Sahyadri stopped off in Fiji's capital Suva, offering free medical screenings to hundreds of people in a public park.The Sahyadri isn't a hospital ship like the Peace Ark and its medical outreach is much more modest.But the message being conveyed is the same — India, like China, is a capable and generous power, with both the capacity and the goodwill to help smaller nations which sometimes struggle to deliver basic services.The Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese embassy in Fiji, Yang Zhaohui, told local reporters that the Peace Ark was a powerful symbol.""Serving as a peace messenger, the Peace Ark embodies China's new secu­rity concept with peace, development and cooperation,"" he said.How about Australia?Canberra doesn't have the resources to match Beijing, but our doctors and nurses have been working on the US Nursing Ships Mercy and Brunswick, which have offered free healthcare to a host of Pacific Island and South-East Asian nations this year.Australian medical experts on some of our largest naval vessels have also conducted medical workshops in Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga and Samoa, as well as helping with Australia's disaster relief efforts across the region.Hospital ships generate plenty of attention, and both the Peace Ark and the Sahyadri have been greeted by glowing headlines across the Pacific region.But are their visits invaluable public health interventions — or empty media stunts?Dr Tess Cain from TNC Pacific consulting said that whenever the Peace Ark has pulled into port it has been greeted by long queues of people who want medical help.""They are obviously meeting some need because we've seen in all of the ports of call there have been thousands of people wanting to take advantage of the services available,"" she said.However there are limits on what these ships can provide.Doctors on hospital ships can offer useful health checks and fix niggling problems like toothaches and abscesses.The Peace Ark has also conducted more complex surgeries while in the Pacific, such as fixing eye cataracts.But the ships are only ever in port for a short period of time, so medical professionals who are only stopping off simply cannot provide the long-term care and follow-up which is needed to deal with chronic disease, particularly lifestyle diseases like diabetes, cirrhosis and hypertension.""If you talk to people who manage public health budgets, they would say — quite rightly — that these ships are not able to contribute to some of the bigger, long-term issues that these countries are dealing with, like the management of non-communicable diseases,"" Dr Cain said.""These ships are not geared for that.""Still, that might be changing.When the Peace Ark departed Port Moresby it left behind a team of 10 Chinese medical specialists.They'll spend the next three years working in the capital's General Hospital.Dr Cain said that could set a new precedent for hospital ships in the region.""This is quite a significant investment, and it will be interesting to see if other countries in the region look at that and decide they will also make a request to the Chinese Government as well,"" she said.And if China leads — then other nations might soon follow.","China, Foreign Aid, Health, India, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, United States, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2018-08-21T19:23:45+00:00

She was one of 13 children and five pregnant women in the community — which does not have a health clinic or electricity — who was vaccinated by a local nurse.With more than 80 islands spread over some 1,600 kilometres, providing medical services to people across Vanuatu is no easy task. Just one third of inhabited islands in the archipelago have established roads and air strips.Almost 20 per cent of children in the country do not receive essential childhood vaccines as a result, according to figures provided by Unicef, which is supporting the project.It hopes to expand the trials, which allows vaccines to reach their destination in a matter of hours, not days — which is crucial as the medicines must be kept cold to remain viable.""It's extremely hard to carry ice boxes to keep the vaccines cool while walking across rivers, mountains, through the rain, across rocky ledges,"" Miriam Nampil, the nurse who injected the vaccine, said. ""I've relied on boats, which often get cancelled due to bad weather. As the journey is often long and difficult, I can only go there once a month to vaccinate children.""Although drones have been used to transport medicines before, Unicef says that Tuesday's flight is the first time a government has contracted a commercial drone company to help roll out vaccination services.Unicef executive director Henrietta Fore called the short flight a ""big leap for global health"", with hopes the program being trialled in Vanuatu could be expanded to other countries.""With the world still struggling to immunise the hardest-to-reach children, drone technologies can be a game changer for bridging that last mile to reach every child,"" she said.""Today's first-of-a-kind vaccine delivery has enormous potential not only for Vanuatu, but also for the thousands of children who are missing out on vaccines across the world.""","Health, Medical Sciences, Pacific, Science and Technology, Vanuatu, ",2018-12-19T11:06:51+00:00

What we need to do now, funding permitting, and this is always a challenge with these things, but we could have the prototype units ready for a pilot by the middle of 2019,"" he said.Dr Gardner-Stephen explained that regular tsunami warning systems use towers that are expensive to buy, maintain, and require expert installation so only a small percentage of vulnerable communities have access to them.He said the new technology used very small and low-cost receivers and did not employ a dish that would require careful calibration.""What we've done in comparison is make something which is small, its gets a signal by satellite so it doesn't matter what happens to the local cellular network … so we can provide for a village for about $200 instead of $10,000 with an effective tsunami and all-hazard warning system,"" he said.""It will also provide the village with a local radio station so that they can get news, weather, information to help to adapt to climate change, food security, water security, all manner of things that are of value to this community.""He said the tsunami alert that had been tested in Vanuatu used a siren, which could be something as cheap as an airhorn.""It only needs to be audible within a local village area,"" he said.""The old way is quite suitable for large industrialised cities where you want it to be heard for kilometres.""Whereas in a rural village context in an Indo-Pacific region … we don't need to have a really expensive piece of infrastructure.""Dr Gardner-Stephen said when a 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Palu on the central island of Sulawesi in Indonesia last month, the resulting tsunami struck eight minutes later, and killed at least 1,300 people and displaced hundreds of thousands.He said the earthquake knocked out the phone network so a warning couldn't be sent out to villages.""And of course in these remote villages … they may not have power to charge their phones so they may be kept off to conserve power except when they need to use them,"" he said.""So all these little remote communities that were away from the main population had absolutely no way of getting the alert.""Dr Gardner-Stephen said a pilot of the new technology would cost around $500,000 and a rollout in a country like Vanuatu would probably cost around $2 million.He said while costs would be significantly lower in the long run, funding was still the ""only barrier"" holding back a rollout of the technology.""Our recent work in Vanuatu costs about 1 per cent of the investment required for conventional tsunami warning towers,"" he said.""We could potentially be rolling out within that region progressively from around the end of 2019.""We're not talking a great length of time, we're not even talking a great financial cost to do that, but of course we have to find the partners.""","Adelaide, Disaster Prevention, Disasters and Accidents, SA, Science, Science and Technology, Storms, Vanuatu, ",2018-11-06T03:02:40+00:00

At the grass root level, I do believe the people that are benefiting from the treatment are happy,"" Mr Sanchez said.""At the government level, it's just strengthening relations between China and its partners around the world.""But while the Peace Ark may be making inroads for China's hearts and minds campaign it is still lagging a long way behind its biggest rivals.""For every positive initiative that we hear about there is a negative one, like illegal fishing,"" Mr Sanchez said.""The US has Hollywood, it has pop culture.

While the move seems more permanent this time, some Ambaeans are already signalling their intention to return — and they're not alone in their desire to move back home after a volcanic eruption. Many communities around the world contend with the dangers of nearby volcanoes and some even refuse to move when there's every indication an eruption may be imminent. So why would you live in the shadow of an active volcano?Dr Ilan Kelman at the Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction at University College London has specifically looked at that very question. ""Ultimately people live near volcanoes because it's home,"" he said. ""When you are near a volcano, as long as it's not causing immediate direct lethal threats, often the people know how to deal with that and they're quite happy dealing with it because there are so many advantages to it.""Those advantages can include highly fertile land that can yield very successful crops, as well as access to good water supplies.Another drawcard is the money that can be made from volcano tourism.""There can also be wonderful hikes, gorgeous scenery, and absolutely spectacular coastlines and mountains in volcanic areas, which draw people to it and lead to income,"" Dr Kelman told the ABC. In Japan, which sits on the ""Pacific Ring of Fire"" where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur, entire resort towns have been built around traditional baths known as ""onsen"" which are heated by the geothermal springs commonly found in areas of high volcanic activity. Visitors to some onsen in Kagoshima can even bathe while watching the constantly-smoking crater of the country's most active volcano, Mount Sakurajima.The geothermal activity can also be a reliable source of energy. ""A good proportion of Iceland is reliant on geothermal heat, as well as parts of New Zealand,"" Dr Kelman said.But sometimes, people who live near volcanoes simply don't have anywhere else to go. ""Land on volcanoes tends to be the cheapest land around, so sometimes people can't afford to move,"" Dr Amy Donovan, a lecturer in Geography and Environmental Hazards at King's College London, told the ABC.""You can kind of reframe it and say 'well there's a risk from the volcano, but there's also the risk of not being able to make a living, and the risk of losing the place where you belong, and losing a part of your identity in a way'.""And some people view that risk as really, really threatening.""When the Soufriere Hills volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat erupted in the 1990s, many families moved to nearby Antigua or to the United Kingdom. But Dr Kelman said some decided to move back — despite the ongoing volcanic activity — because the families in Antigua were worried about the high levels of crime and those who moved to England were worried about what they considered the relatively poor access to education.""So consequently, many families in Antigua and England decided that it would be safer on a volcanic island,"" she said.""They would have a better life on a volcanic island than they did, compared to the levels of education or levels of crime that they were experiencing elsewhere.""In Vanuatu, much of the population have moved to the nearby islands of Maewo and Santo — but they, too, are reporting problems. Susan Ngwele is living on Santo and said many were finding it hard to earn an income or access food, instead relying on friends and relatives. ""Sometimes we are embarrassed because we cause them so much burden just to help us out,"" she said. Like communities all over the world, it seems some people from Ambae still feel they'd be happier at home — even if that home is an active volcano.","Disasters and Accidents, Indonesia, Vanuatu, Volcanic Eruptions, ",2018-10-05T22:09:18+00:00

But thousands remain on the island, where ashfall is predicted to worsen.The National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) said even previously designated safe zones on East Ambae were no longer safe.The Vanuatu Red Cross, which has been assisting with evacuations, said many roads were no longer accessible and visibility was deteriorating.Manson Tari, the NDMO's Penama Province disaster officer, said the whole island should be permanently evacuated.""The situation is becoming more critical compared to other months or even last year,"" he said.Mr Tari said the eruptions could get even worse.""Many hazards that were not, never seen, we are now seeing them,"" he said.Melinda Aru, an analyst with the country's Geohazards Department, said they raised the alert level to three last Saturday.""The ash will continue to affect the communities around Ambae and any neighbouring island following the wind direction,"" she said.","Disasters and Accidents, Pacific, Vanuatu, Volcanic Eruptions, ",2018-07-27T03:07:40+00:00

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop argues Pacific nations shouldn't be left in a position where they only have China to turn to for capital.With one breath, there's fierce debate in Federal Parliament about curbing foreign influence in Australia. But the next moment, Canberra is seeking to ensure its own influence, reputation and clout in the Pacific isn't diminished. Vanuatu's Prime Minister Charlot Salwai will get the full pomp and ceremony welcome to Parliament House this morning, a week-and-a-half after his Solomon Islands counterpart Rick Houenipwela received the same treatment.While in town, Mr Houenipwela signed a deal with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull for a 4,000-kilometre, high-speed, undersea internet cable between Honiara and Sydney — a project Australian taxpayers will foot most of the bill for. The cash from the foreign aid budget was thrown at the cable once Australia's intelligence agencies caught wind that Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei was not only sniffing around the project, but already had an in-principle deal with the Solomons. Concerns about the security risk Huawei presents are well documented around the world. Mr Salwai is likely to ask Mr Turnbull to chip in for a similar project to his country, which is marginally closer to Australia. It will provide another opportunity for Canberra to try to ward off seemingly attractive offers from Beijing.""China follows a development path that is completely different from that of traditional major powers,"" China's ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye told a business forum in Parliament House last week, defending his nation from reports it was leaving small Pacific countries laden with debt.""China never interferes in the internal affairs of other countries.""That's not the way Canberra views it. Despite arguing our relationship with Beijing is strong and robust, there has been strain in recent months.There is tension even if the relationship isn't broken, as China's appetite for influence across the globe becomes insatiable.It's a conundrum for Australia's Government — the might of the world's second-largest economy and its aggressive state-driven expansionist policies make competing for diplomatic territory difficult, but Australia doesn't want to cede to China as the dominant power in its own backyard. China has already snaffled up broadcast frequencies in the Pacific abandoned by the ABC's Radio Australia amid crippling budget cuts.But it is relatively small infrastructure projects like internet cables to the Solomons that are being viewed as Australia's way back to prominence.","Australia, China, Community and Society, Defence and National Security, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Aid, Government and Politics, Security Intelligence, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2018-06-24T19:15:11+00:00

Many are the descendants of blackbirded islanders sent back to Vanuatu at the turn of the 20th Century, in line with the White Australia Policy.Between 1863 and 1904, more than 62,000 Pacific Islanders were taken to Australia — often against their will, or on false pretences — to work on Queensland's cotton and sugar plantations.But Emelda Davis, chairwoman of the Australian South Sea Islanders Port Jackson chapter, said it wasn't just Pacific Islanders who were kicked out of Australia.She said there were stories of islander workers taking in orphaned Indigenous Australian children, as well as stories of workers marrying and establishing families with Indigenous Australians. ""Then when the White Australia Policy came in, the mass deportation did take a lot of those Indigenous families back to the islands,"" she said.""It's always something that was known, but it's quite interesting that it's being promoted or brought to the attention of the Australian Government now.""David Abel, a former Vanuatu MP and a descendent of a Pacific Islander blackbirded to Australia, has long been an advocate for better recognition of that dark chapter in Australia's history.He and his brother, Chief Richard David Fandanumata, a member of Vanuatu's influential National Council of Chiefs, were in Adelaide this week for a forum on the topic hosted by the University of South Australia.Both brothers have Aboriginal ancestry through their mother, and have been tracking others down around Vanuatu.""We started receiving stories from all around the islands, I came here with some figures that put them up to over 4,000,"" Mr Abel said.Chief Richard said they are not necessarily seeking Australian citizenship, but they do want to be recognised.""Plenty of us, when we look at our history, our bloodlines, our family tree, they call us Australians,"" he said.""They connect us. And we want to become part of the family. Those of us in Vanuatu want to be connected with our family in Australia.""The brothers are trying to track down their Australian family, the majority of whom are believed to be from the Tweed Heads region of New South Wales.But there is some disunity within the group who have travelled to Australia.One of the descendants claims many people with Aboriginal ancestry experience discrimination back in Vanuatu, and don't have equal access to customary land or education.Pakoa Rudy Rolland, a police officer on Tongariki Island, told The Australian newspaper last week that hundreds of people with Indigenous Australian heritage in his community were living as second-class citizens.But Mr Abel said while he agreed there was ""a history"" of issues with land rights, many descendants of Indigenous Australians in Vanuatu have had successful careers.He said he did not want the comments to overshadow their trip.""There's a Lord Mayor, even the person who's giving this information is a police officer, some of them were teachers.

Businesses need to identify any modern slavery in their supply chain If passed, the laws will mean around 3,000 businesses in Australia with an annual turnover of $100 million or more will need to identity any modern slavery in their supply chain, and report it to authorities.   ""Businesses will then have to detail what steps they have taken, and will take, to address these risks,"" said Assistant Minister for Home Affairs Alex Hawke.""This bill will enable large businesses, consumers, civil society and government to work together to eliminate modern slavery in supply chains.""A Modern Slavery Business Engagement Unit, costing $3.6 million, will be set up the reporting requirements and support the 3,000 affected Australian businesses.Modern slavery includes where people are forced into prostitution, or forced to work for low wages in construction, sweatshops or food supply chains. It can include also underpayment of wages, denied visa extensions by employers or being forced to live in squalid accommodation.Opposition justice spokesperson Clare O'Neil said the bill was weak because it did not set a penalty for businesses that refused to report on slavery in their supply chain.  ""It shouldn't be optional to decide whether you follow the law or not,"" she said. ""The penalties Labor is calling for are not for businesses that find slavery in their supply chain, because businesses who find slavery and do something about it should be applauded,"" she said. ""We are talking about businesses that can't even be bothered complying with the modern slavery act, because if they can't be bothered making a report, then I think they should be penalised.""A department spokesperson told the ABC penalties  were not needed to ensure business followed the law, but the law would be reviewed  in three years to see if it was working. ""Business feedback indicates the primary driver for compliance will be investor pressure and reputational costs and benefits,"" the spokesperson said. ""This will drive compliance more effectively than legislated penalties and encourage a business-led 'race to the top'"".Labor also criticised the bill for not establishing an independent modern slavery commissioner, similar to the United Kingdom model, and will lobby for such a role to be created.  ""We want this bill to go ahead with bipartisan support, so we are pushing for a bill that does what it says it is trying to do, which is to tackle modern slavery,"" Ms O'Neil.Keren Adams from the Human Rights Law Centre agreed the bill needed to be strengthened to force businesses to comply. ""Without financial penalties — and with no independent Commissioner to help enforce them — the new laws will lack the necessary teeth to make sure the worst offenders lift their game.""""The Government must urgently address the weaknesses in this bill and send a strong message to brands that profiting from abuse will not be tolerated.""The United Nations estimates 25 million people are exploited in global supply chains, including in the agriculture, manufacturing and construction industries, and about 4,000 of those are thought to be in Australia.Modern slavery abroad takes various forms. It can refer to people forced into prostitution, or forced to work for low wages in construction, sweatshops or food supply chains. They can be forced to work through threat of violence, bullying, or in more extreme cases they can be literally sold and bought, or have their movements restricted.In Australia, it manifests more commonly in the horticulture sector, particularly with backpackers who are underpaid, denied visa extension by their employers or forced to live in squalid accommodation.Mark Lamb, from the global peak body for procurement,  the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS),  said the laws showed Australia wass serious about addressing modern slavery locally and overseas. ""I think this is an excellent first step for Australia because we have already seen it implemented in other countries, and for Australia to implement this it is a great step forward,"" he said.""Understanding what goes on in the international supply chain is absolutely paramount and this really brings the issue under focus.""Do businesses actually know what's happening in their supply chain,"" he saidIn May CIPS released the results of its slavery survey, which found most procurement managers were ill-prepared for the new government requirements.In the survey, 45 per cent of procurement managers agreed the legislation was needed, but a quarter of all respondents were concerned it would ultimately have little impact.At the time of the survey, 20 per cent of organisations had not taken any measures to ensure a slavery-free supply chain, but 80 per cent said they were motivated to address the issue due to the reputation risk of ignoring it. Mr Lamb said these news laws would change that. ""When we have done research at CIPS, only 11 per cent of organisations have total transparency across their entire supply chains, whether its food or otherwise,"" he said. ""They often know who their tier one supplier is, but beyond that it is not well understood.""This act forces them to dig deeper and understand what is happening in their supply chain.""The Government said the legislation was not a response to recommendations by a 2017 parliamentary inquiry into modern slavery, whose recommendations were still being considered.

Others have strong cultural associations.""Mr Scott said the Manaro volcano on Ambae island had a large eruption about 400 years ago and has had several smaller eruptions over the past 100 years.There have been three phases in the current eruption, with the most recent phase, which started in March, producing the most ash.He said the volcano has actually quietened down over the past two weeks, although there is no way of predicting if and when the next explosive phase would begin.Asked if there was a chance that the residents might be able to one day move back to the island, Mr Bule, the government spokesman, said that was not a question for him.""We don't know,"" he said. ""You'll have to ask the volcano.""AP","Foreign Aid, Vanuatu, Volcanic Eruptions, ",2018-05-03T10:04:11+00:00

Now retired, the Admiral worries that climate change could cause huge security issues for the nation and no longer bound by office he is free to speak his mind.Admiral Barrie has posed the scenario of what would happen if a Cape Town-style water crisis hit right across Asia, driven by receding glaciers in the Himalayan mountains.""I'm talking China, around the Mekong river into Burma, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan.

Over the past several years the Sydney-based milliner has been working with disadvantaged women in rural areas of Vanuatu to build their business skills and improve the products they can sell.""They're brilliant weavers and make the most wonderful bags and mats which are part of their tradition,"" Ms Boylan said.She is now encouraging them to adapt their existing skills to create handwoven pandanus hats and expand their opportunities for distribution.""I think it's about them building their confidence to step into the marketplace and be seen, for their work to be valued, and for them to be economically independent,"" she said.""For me in this stage of my career it's about sharing my skills and I really enjoy the cross-cultural approach.""Ms Boylan is currently working under the Vanuatu Skills Partnership, a joint-initiative supported by the Australian and Vanuatu governments.To improve and speed up the hat-making process, Ms Boylan introduced the women to a replica colonial-era tool she came across during her research into traditional weaving.It consists of a wooden handle with a set of short, sharp metal blades at the end.When dragged, it greatly speeds up the process of shredding leaves into strips of consistent widths.The original device on which it was modelled was discovered underneath floorboards during archaeological diggings at Sydney's Hyde Park Barracks in the early 1980s.""It's a one-of-a-kind tool,"" the curator of Hyde Park Barracks Museum, Dr Fiona Starr, said.She believed the shredder was once used by convict settlers who were known to have made wide-brimmed hats out of cabbage tree palm leaves. ""On first glance you'd have to think about what it's used for, but once you know a little bit about the process of preparing the leaves for hat making, then it makes sense.""Historical records from 1844 show the convicts sold their hats to other detainees and free settlers, an act that was prohibited by authorities.""The government-issued hats were quite useless for protecting their heads and faces from the sun, so they improvised their own,"" Dr Starr said.With long-held traditional production methods already in use, Ms Boylan said the women were initially hesitant to use the leaf shredder but they're now seeing its benefits.""They are just finally picking up on it and enjoying using and finding that it's speeding up their work,"" she said. Most importantly, Ms Boylan is helping the women create a consistent range of products and achieve a fair pricing structure.When completed, the hats are sold domestically in the marketplaces of Luganville and Port Vila. ""I think the Ni-Vans (Vanuatu nationals) and the tourist population like them too because it's a 'Made in Vanuatu' product,"" she said.One group of weavers received a large order to provide hats for the Pacific Games hosted in Vanuatu during 2017.Locally made goods have even attracted the eye of British royalty.""Prince Charles was in Port Vila the other day and he bought one of the hats that was woven in Vanuatu for Camilla. So that's exciting,"" Ms Boylan said.Returning to Sydney, Ms Boylan also distributes the hats to a shopfront retailer in the city centre.She has since launched the brand Pacific Brim, a name which relates to her work with women from Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand.The collaboration is a way of getting the regionally sourced, sustainable products to a wider market and increasing the profits that flow back to the women and their communities.""It's opening a pathway of trade for these women so they can get an understanding of the protocols of export and biosecurity and an order that's more than just selling one hat,"" she said.""It's taking them up to the next level to being participants in the formal economy."" Ms Boylan said she hoped the women would one day independently take on the manufacturing, selling and distribution to reach an international market.""I fully believe they have the capacity to be setting up their businesses, managing that and selling direct from Vanuatu.""","Fashion, Foreign Aid, History, Human Interest, Pacific, Sydney, Vanuatu, Women, Womens Status, ",2018-05-02T21:45:14+00:00
194,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-23/understanding-foreign-influence-in-the-pacific/9895622,"China's growing influence throughout the Pacific should point to one thing for Canberra: Australia needs to become more sophisticated in its engagement in the region.Tomorrow, Vanuatu's Prime Minister Charlot Salwai will land in Australia for his first official visit after reports earlier this year that China was constructing a military base on the Pacific nation, and how well the visit goes depends largely on whether the Australian Government can effectively listen to and respond to the concerns of Pacific leaders.Diplomatic approaches to Pacific Island nations must always consider and remember our shared regional concerns, rather than being premised on the idea of ""us"" Australia and ""them"" Pacific Island nations.Having strong and stable governments throughout the South Pacific is central to maintaining the security of the region, and the days of Canberra asserting itself as a ""deputy sheriff"" to the United States across the region have ended.Many Pacific Island nations have a sophisticated approach to diplomacy that involves building ties with numerous foreign nations, and China is often the preferred provider of large-scale infrastructure, partly because it is prepared to fund projects that other donors will not.""Australia needs to understand that our projects with China do not involve debt trap diplomacy,"" Vanuatu's Minister for Foreign Affairs Ralph Regenvanu, for whom I used to provide legal advice, told me ahead of the trip this weekend. ""We will continue to create donor relationships that are in the interests of the people of Vanuatu.""Pacific leaders are not simply going to give up their diplomatic relationships with Beijing and other governments around the world just because Australia wants them to.In the book New Pacific Diplomacy, Greg Fry and Sandra Tarte explore how Pacific leaders are increasingly engaging in new strategies to control the diplomatic agenda in trade negotiations, to promote sustainable development and better governance of the oceans and to inform global compacts to address climate change.In all of these areas, the Pacific as a region is increasingly defining its own agenda, to the exclusion of Australia and New Zealand.Canberra must learn how to better respond to the agendas of Pacific leaders individually and on a case by case basis, as Pacific leaders, like politicians everywhere, are not equally worthy of Australian Government support.The story of Vanuatu and its relationship with Beijing and Canberra is illustrative of the complicated politics at play in Melanesian countries.Government instability has long-been the norm in contemporary politics with political parties constantly splitting and reforming, based on a fragile web of personal and political alliances.Just this week, another motion of no confidence against Mr Salwai was tabled in Parliament.Vanuatu's turbulent political context has meant that investors who have ready access to cash often have extensive leverage over the formation of government.These issues played out publicly in Vanuatu back in 2014 in what was dubbed ""the bribery case"" where 14 members of Parliament — including acting prime minister Moana Carcasses — were found guilty in 2016 of either paying or accepting bribes to support a motion of no confidence against the Natuman government.Current Mr Salwai was then elected in a snap election just weeks later.However, looking back, it is important to note that funds for the bribes in the high profile corruption scandal came through a complex web of financial sector companies via Hong Kong and then managed through a transaction of land held by Marie Louise Carcasses, wife of former prime minister Moana Carcasses.And while the current Vanuatu Government is adamant that it will not support the development of a foreign military base, the bribery case clearly demonstrates one of the many ways that Pacific governments can easily become beholden to foreign interests.Back in 2013, the government of former prime minister Carcasses, for instance, initially pursued an agenda in 2013 to lease all of Vanuatu's major airports to a Singapore based investment company.The deal, which included a $350 million cash windfall payment to be provided to the company by Vanuatu, was narrowly avoided.The escaped deal was followed by accusations and counter-accusations in 2015 that Vanuatu was involved in schemes to sell honorary citizenship to Chinese investors through various Hong Kong based companies.Given these various relationships to foreign investors and funding, Australia must look to support Pacific leaders who are tackling the drivers of undue foreign influence in their government.This means supporting leaders who are committed to promoting transparent government that operates in the interests of their constituents.Mr Regenvanu recently described the steps taken in the Pacific nation to limit the political influence over government:""We have introduced reforms to stop government interference in state owned enterprises,"" he said.""And to limit political interference in the appointment of Director Generals of government agencies as well as diplomatic appointments.""We are committed to a more transparent government.""These efforts by the current government is building off of previous land reforms from 2014 that I was personally involved in drafting that ended the large-scale corrupt leasing of urban and customary land across Vanuatu.This was an important step in limiting the influence of foreign and long-term expatriate residents over political and legal processes in Vanuatu.And while Australia supported these initiatives, it was only to a very limited degree, and Canberra never appeared to really understand the wider political implications of the land reform package.Vanuatu is a test case for Australia's capacity to build a new style of relationship with Pacific nations.Limiting the influence of China will involve creating better partnerships with more open dialogue, it will also involve supporting leaders who are trying to build better government.Mr Salwai will no doubt bring to Canberra a series of requests.""We want a 'special visa' category for seasonal agricultural workers,"" Mr Regenvanu said.""It's good for Vanuatu and it's good for Australian farmers. I'm hoping we can find a way forward"". Australia needs to be prepared to listen and respond to Pacific leaders requests, particularly when those leaders are the ones who themselves are attempting to strengthen their own governments and remove it from the undue influence of foreign investors.Siobhan McDonnell is a research fellow at the ANU.

195,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-22/china-military-south-pacific-vanuatu-us-bases-australia/9770408,"A recent article claiming the Chinese Government approached officials in Vanuatu about building a permanent military presence on the island, and the response to it by Australian officials, highlights the threat such a base would pose to Australian security.Vanuatu's Foreign Minister, Ralph Regenvanu, denied the ""paranoid"" claims, and said Vanuatu was against any sort of militarisation of its territory.China's Department of Foreign Affairs also refuted the story, labelling it ""fake news"", and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop affirmed her belief Australia remained Vanuatu's strategic partner of choice.It appears the matter can be laid to rest for now, but we in Australia should take it as an opportunity for reflection.The matter of Chinese bases in the Pacific will almost certainly arise again, and the major reason will be the US-led strategic encirclement of China, in which Australia plays an important role.The prospect of a foreign base in Vanuatu strikes a particular chord in the Australian psyche.Australia has been obsessed with the fear of foreign powers setting up in the archipelago that surrounds our continent for most of our history. So much so that throughout the latter half of the 19th century, Australian politicians, media outlets, and religious organisations persistently petitioned the British Colonial Office to annex any and all ""unclaimed"" islands of the South Pacific, lest any part should fall into the hands of a rival power.The campaign to annex the New Hebrides, as Vanuatu was then known, and keep it out of French hands was particularly intense. From the 1860s onwards, the Australian colonies produced a constant stream of public and legislative assembly resolutions, media articles, and political speeches called for the British annexation of the islands.Probably the single most important driving factor behind the federation of Australia itself was the perception the British could not be relied upon to promote Australian regional security interests, and the desire to establish an Australian ""Monroe Doctrine in the Pacific"" held strong currency among Australia's first federal political leaders.The French threat in the New Hebrides was resolved through a joint governance agreement between Britain and France in 1906. Ironically, as Japan emerged as the main foreign threat to Australia in the Pacific, the idea was soon circulated among Australian leaders to cede the British stake in the islands entirely to the French, so as to establish a third power in the region to help balance against Japan.History and geopolitics show that as long as we have strategic rivals, the South Pacific islands will be a potential point of vulnerability for Australia.This begs the question of how to avoid the intensification of strategic rivalry with our neighbours.A fairly obvious answer would be to follow our own advice, and advocate for the demilitarisation of the region.The reason China would have an interest in establishing a military base on a remote Pacific island, is that they themselves are surrounded by a dense and heavily armed archipelago of American military bases, 250 or so according to US Department of Defence statistics.Australia is itself home to several valuable US bases that would certainly be used in any conflict with China. The most important of them, Pine Gap, sits in the centre of the country and acts as a geospatial operations and intelligence hub.On top of its role in America's global drone surveillance and targeting programs, Pine Gap is also a vital piece of the United States' nuclear warfighting apparatus, the capabilities and destructive capacity of which has been radically increased in recent years.Australia is also host to a fully equipped US Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) stationed in Darwin, south of the Straits of Malacca, which is an important chokepoint for China's seaborne energy and trade.Vanuatu's location is particularly strategic as it lies within the sea lines of communication between the United States and Australia, so American forces transiting to Australia would pass nearby.The MAGTF base in Darwin has only been in operation for a few years, and came into being as a result of the American ""pivot to Asia"", announced by then-president Barack Obama in Australian Parliament in 2011. The pivot aims to reassert American dominance of the Asia-Pacific region, and is easily the single biggest example of militarisation of the region that has been seen in decades.Our own actions show we are only opposed to the militarisation of the region when it is done by the other side.The sense of danger that grips us when we are confronted with the possibility of one Chinese base on an island 2,000 kilometres away should give us pause to consider how China's sense of security is affected by a chain of hundreds of American bases stretching longitudinally along the Western Pacific.Australian leaders are right to oppose the construction of a Chinese military base in the South Pacific.But as long as we enthusiastically support, encourage, and participate in the much larger American military build-up in the region, rather than seeking to moderate and reduce regional tensions through our alliance, we should expect nothing else.Stuart Rollo is a research associate at the Sydney Democracy Network at the University of Sydney.","China, Donald Trump, Globalisation - Society, Jinping, Xi, Obama, Barack, Pacific, Politics and Government, Security Intelligence, United States, Unrest, Conflict and War, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2018-05-21T19:00:00+00:00

200,https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2017-11-22/volcanoes-heres-what-happens-when-they-erupt/8997014,"Planet Earth is covered in hundreds of volcanoes, many of which will be erupting at any one time.Many of us only notice volcanoes when they are about to explode or disrupt our travel plans, but these spectacular forces of nature can have a significant impact on people living in the local area.While volcanoes can be destructive, they are also responsible for creating rich agricultural soil, minerals like gold and silver, diamonds, hot springs and geothermal energy.So how do these iconic wonders form, and what risks do they really pose?A volcano is like a chimney that allows hot liquid rock, called magma, to flow from a layer within the Earth and erupt onto the surface. The magma can come from as far down as 200 kilometres in the mantle and once it erupts — at a piping hot 700 to 1,200 degrees Celsius — it is called lava.As magma rises through many kilometres to the Earth's surface, dissolved gases contained within it form expanding bubbles.These bubbles increase the pressure of the magma and, if this pressure is great enough, the volcano will erupt.The amount, temperature and composition of magma, including the amount of trapped gas contained in it, determines the type of volcano formed.The three most common large types of volcanoes are strato, shield and caldera.Strato volcanoes are cone-shaped mountains that have been built up from layers of ash and lava. They are generally the tallest type of volcano and are known for their violent explosions.Bubbles of gas build up in the magma — which has a high silica content — and explode creating volcanic ash, consisting of tiny gritty sharp fragments of glassy snap-frozen magma and rock from the sides of the volcano vent.Examples of strato volcanoes include Agung in Bali, Yasur in Vanuatu, Etna in Italy and Fuji in Japan.This flatter type of volcano is named after the Roman Centurion shield shape of the volcano made by repeated gentle flows of lava down its slopes.Shield volcanoes have magma with a relatively low silica content.The magma is very hot and runny, so they are less likely to build up and create explosions — although they still can.There are many shield volcanoes in Hawaii and Iceland, including Kilaeua and Eyjafjallajökull. Manaro volcano on Ambae Island on Vanuatu is also a shield volcano.This type of volcano has the coolest and stickiest magma. It tends to erupt so violently its top collapses and leaves a large basin shape in its place.The collapse leads to widespread fallout of ash and other hazards.Some caldera volcanoes are up to 90 kilometres across and are called supervolcanoes.Examples of supervolcanoes are Yellowstone in the US and Lake Toba in Indonesia.Volcanoes are found all over the world but the most common location for active volcanoes is at the boundaries of tectonic plates where plates are converging.One plate pushes under another (a process known as subduction) and as it sinks it melts and generates an explosive type of magma that is vented through volcanoes on the upper plate.These kinds of volcanoes are common along the so-called Ring of Fire — a horseshoe-shaped area around the Pacific Ocean.Volcanoes also occur in the middle of oceans where tectonic plates are pulling apart or diverging.This mainly occurs underwater, where it can also lead to hydrothermal vents on the deep sea floor that harbour extreme forms of life.Volcanic activity in Iceland also comes from diverging tectonic plates. Some volcanoes occur in the middle of tectonic plates, and are created as the plate moves over a hot part of the Earth's interior.As the plate continues to move across the ""hot spot"", a chain of volcanoes, like those seen in the islands of Hawaii, are created.The Big Island is the biggest active aboveground volcano on Earth — around 180 kilometres wide by nine kilometres high.Some small volcanoes only erupt once in their lives, while other volcanoes erupt multiple times.Kilaeua volcano in Hawaii, which has been erupting continuously since 1983, is the world's most active volcano.While some volcanoes erupt at regular intervals, there are always exceptions to the rule.And even volcanoes that haven't erupted for more than 10,000 years — traditionally thought to have been extinct — can start up again, says volcanologist Ray Cas, an emeritus professor at Monash University.For example, Professor Cas says recent evidence suggests the Yellowstone supervolcano appears to have a major eruption every 700,000 years, with the last being just that — 700,000 years ago. It is now showing signs of stirring.""It's in the category of perhaps being due for another one,"" Professor Cas says.Predicting when eruptions are going to occur and whether there will be an explosion or just a lava flow can be very tricky.""There's a high degree of unpredictability … because nature and magma don't follow black and white rules,"" Professor Cas says.While quakes tell us magma is moving, that does not mean it will get to the surface. It's possible it will cool and solidify before it erupts.The major hurdle for scientists in predicting eruptions is they don't have any way of remotely sensing the characteristics of magma that determines how it will behave.Every country in the world with active volcanoes monitors their activity and shares the information globally.Such monitoring and alert warnings for volcanic eruptions are based on assessing clues such as:Flowing hot lava can incinerate, bury and bulldoze things in its path but at least is usually moving slowly enough for humans to get out of its way.But when a volcano explodes things get a lot more spectacular — and risky.For a start there's hot gas and rock (called pyroclastic flows or surges) that tumble down the slopes — this is what buried the city of Pompeii when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. Then there are ""volcanic bombs"" made of rock that can fly out of the vent and an eruption cloud made of ash and gas that shoots up into the air. Exploding volcanoes also lead to mud slides (called lahars) and tsunami.Earthquakes, landslides and flooding from volcanoes melting surrounding glaciers are some events associated with eruption.A 10th of the world's population lives within the potential footprint of volcanoes, with more than 800 million people living within 100 km of active volcanoes.According to recent research analysing fatalities from volcanic activity between 1500 and 2017, about 540 people a year are killed by volcanic activity. Most of these people were killed within a 10 km radius but deaths still occur up to 170 km away.Ballistics or volcanic bombs are the biggest immediate danger.  Pyroclastic flows and fast moving avalanches of hot rock, ash, and gas are the most dominant threat between 5 and 15 kilometres from the volcano.Fine falling ash can cause respiratory problems, as can the gases released during explosions, in particular carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, Professor Cas says.""Carbon dioxide is potentially the most dangerous volcanic gas because it's dense so it settles and stays near the ground and secondly you can't smell it,"" he says.Sulfur dioxide also contributes to acid rain and volcanic emissions also affect the weather and climate.While carbon dioxide has a warming effect, the main effect of the volcanic emissions — is a cooling effect, Dr Cas says.This is because of ash, and sulphur dioxide (reacting with water vapour in the air), leading to the albedo effect — or reflection of the Sun's heat.Professor Cas says this is especially the case with supervolcanoes — whose major eruptions release in the order of 40 to 1000 cubic kilometres of molten rock.""The very fine ash and gas gets lifted into the upper atmosphere, circumnavigates the globe and begins to effect the climate,"" he says. Flying into volcanic ash clouds can also be a major hazard for air travel.Aircraft engines are so hot they melt the ash back into fragments of magma that clog up the exit vents.Aircraft carry radar that detect volcanic ash clouds and advisory centres around the world use satellites to track the ash clouds and provide warnings to planes.Engines on the ground can also be affected by volcanic ash.","Bali, Earth Sciences, Hawaii, Iceland, Indonesia, Science and Technology, Vanuatu, Volcanic Eruptions, ",2017-11-22T01:22:37+00:00

Victorian Premier Cricket is often regarded as the toughest and best club cricket in the world, so for Pat to step into that level and hold his own is brilliant.""Former Australian One Day International player of the year, Clint McKay, is mentoring Matautaava at Essendon.He knew little about the player when he first met him, but he came with a great reputation and McKay says he has lived up that.""Coming to Premier Cricket, he's found out just how good he is, and he's playing to the best possible standard he can at the moment,"" McKay said.""He's been pivotal in some of our wins across all formats this season. It's a great foundation for him — he can keep on improving his skills and who knows where he could end up.""In the past, two of Papua New Guinea's leading players, batsman Assad Vala and all-rounder CJ Amini, have secured rookie contracts with Big Bash franchises.But while those deals allowed them to get a flavour of the professional game, they weren't allowed to play, other than as an injury replacement for a teammate, and that opportunity never came along.One of the stars of the Adelaide Strikers' successful Big Bash campaign was the Afghan spinner Rashid Khan, who at 19 has just become the youngest player ever to top the ICC Twenty20 rankings.Until last year, when they were unexpectedly granted Test Match status, Afghanistan, like Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, were an associate cricketing nation, so with Khan blazing a trail, the door may have opened for other players from the lower ranks to follow.Matautaava has done his case no harm by being chosen in the associates team of the year — the only player from tier five to make the list, alongside one from tier three and nine from tier two.""When my coach, Shane Deitz, told me, I couldn't believe it. Then I started getting messages from my family back in Vanuatu saying how proud they were,"" Matautaava said.""It's a fantastic achievement for Patrick,"" Deitz said.""It just shows the standard of his play. In the World Cricket League competition last year he pretty much got us promoted single-handedly.""He was an easy choice as player of the tournament. He was the best player there by far.""It's a remarkable turnaround for a young player from the Pacific who was actually thinking of giving up cricket and taking on seasonal work in Australia to raise money for his family.But the turning point came when he smashed 139 not out against the strongly fancied German team to turn his fortunes and those of his team around.""A miracle happened to me that day,"" Matautaava said.""It was my first century for my country, and when I reached 100, I looked up to the sky and thanked my late father. Every time I played cricket he was there to watch me.""At that moment I was just overcome by emotion and it was then that I changed my mind about fruit picking because I had to stick with cricket.""And no-one is arguing with that decision in Vanuatu, with another World Cricket League tournament on the horizon, or at Essendon where Matautaava continues to impress.It's now just a question of a Twenty20 franchise taking a chance and giving one of the best players in the Pacific a shot at the big time.""The next step for me is the Big Bash,"" Matautaava said.""I want to keep performing and put myself out there, and maybe one day I'll get that contract.""","Australia, Cricket, Essendon, Pacific, Sport, VIC, Vanuatu, ",2018-02-23T23:01:55+00:00

Despite the global attention, the Yakel community's way of life remains unchanged.Lack of experience did not prevent the actors from putting in star performances.The film was nominated for an Oscar this year in the Best Foreign Language category.The cast even made the journey to attend the award ceremony in LA, walking the red carpet in traditional dress.The dialogue of the Australian production is in the Yakel community's indigenous languages, Navhal and Nafe.The film explores the clash between community traditions and encroaching Western values, such as individual freedom.Yakel member Jimmy Joseph Nako, who was the cultural director for the film said ""we want to show us"".""We want to show how we live and the humour of happiness in our culture to the rest of the world,"" Mr Nako said.The true story follows two villagers, whose romance sparks a war between communities.The lovers are both from the same village, but their love affair destroys plans for an arranged marriage, meant to settle a long-standing feud between two island communities.It is said that many years ago a former chief of the Yakel tribe told his people to reject everything introduced from the Western world.The village people eat what the forest provides and wear handmade clothes sourced from local materials.There are no schools, no shops, no TV and no phones or internet.The lifestyle is referred to as kastom.Tribal chief Mungau is deeply respected by the community.Actor Albi Nangia said he believed listening to the chief leads to harmony within the community.""Here the chief has to make a decision for everything,"" he said.""You can say and express anything, but you have to respect the kastom.""You have to be respectful of the chief's decision.

Mr Samoei said the apps meant he could send money to his parents on his phone in real time, rather than waiting for days and paying extra for the money to clear via a more traditional international bank transfer.""[During] the festive season the family comes together and celebrates and the money I send them home buys them presents,"" he said.George Kotsakis from the Australian-Filipino Community organisation, Migrante Australia, said many families could not survive without the money sent home by family members abroad. ""It is the lifeline of the struggling Filipino families back home and it is the support that is much needed, due to unemployment and the cost of living,"" he said.""The Filipinos need to go overseas and work to support their families,"" he said.The apps work because the companies behind them hold money in countries around the world, negating the need for consumers to send their own hard-earned cash overseas.Consumers choose to have the money delivered to their family either through cash pick-up, bank deposit, mobile money or a group chat account on social media.Michael Liu, the regional director for Asia-Pacific for the financial technology company WorldRemit, said traditional infrastructure could be lacking in in developing countries.""Technology has enabled the industry to move online, which means that people can now send from a tablet, a desktop or a mobile phone and the money can be received instantly,"" he said.Mr Liu said technology had been important to many families disconnected by migration.""There's a real power to be able to talk to your family instantly using an instant messaging system and then send money instantly,"" he said.Chairwoman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Digital Finance Advisory Committee, Professor Deborah Ralston, has recently been appointed to the Reserve Bank of Australia's Payments System Board.She said the money sent home — known as remittances — was a mainstream part of those countries' economies.""The question of remittances is incredibly important — some countries receive more money every year than in their total foreign investments,"" she said.""So they are incredibly important in social terms, as well as in economic terms to those countries with a fairly low per capita income.""According to World Bank figures, the top three remittance-receiving countries are India ($US72 billion from around the world), China ($US64 billion US from around the world) and the Philippines ($US30 billion from around the world).The World Bank said the costliest transfers or remittances worldwide were those from Australia to Vanuatu, which cost about 20 per cent of the total money sent.Professor Ralston said a growing number of applications from various financial technology companies would eventually see prices come down.""We will just a see a natural competition coming into that area which has not been there before,"" she said.""It might see downward pressure on fees in the traditional banks or they might exit the retail remittance side of things and stick to the wholesale foreign exchange.""","Australia, Christmas, Computer Science, Immigration, Kenya, Philippines, Science and Technology, Vanuatu, ",2016-12-24T22:05:16+00:00

But for Polynesia we have an absolute date by which it must have occurred which is 1,000 years ago.""At that time, the population started moving out from Tonga and Samoa to the eastern Pacific Islands of Hawaii and Tahiti, then 700 years ago travelled south to become the Maori population in New Zealand.""When they leave 1,000 years ago that mixture has already happened.""But more work with ancient DNA from skeletons of different ages would be needed to clarify exactly when the mixes happened in various locations, Professor Spriggs said.Commenting on the study, director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA Professor Alan Cooper said the paper provided a lot more information about the Pacific and Polynesian origins ""that was just conjecture before"".""It clarifies this whole issue of how you get two groups of people together to form another one that does the most amazing voyages,"" Professor Cooper said.He said the study also raised questions about when the Papuan mix happened in Tonga and subsequently in Polynesia, whose people today have 26 per cent Papuan DNA.""The Tongan individual carried little or no Papuan ancestry providing confirmation the ancestral population of Polynesians was not yet fully formed or widespread by the end of the Lapita,"" he said.""So how long before [the Papuans] catch up? That's a long way out in the Pacific.""You figure that the genetic mix that generated the Polynesians happened before they went out voyaging to the islands.""He said it also raised questions about the identity of the ancient Papuan people, who had a mix of Australian Aboriginal and Papuan DNA.""I'm intrigued by who that Australian-Papuan group was — where do they come from?""I'm going to guess off the top of my head Torres Strait Islands or some coastal group, possibly trading with the Lapita group.""","Archaeology, Genetics, Science and Technology, Tonga, Vanuatu, ",2016-10-03T20:04:44+00:00

Tanna screened at the Venice International Film Festival in 2015, where it picked up the Audience Award Pietro Barzisa.It also won an Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA) award for Best Original Music Score last month.While the Yakel tribe live a wholly traditional life, they are not wholly isolated from the outside world.The nearest township on the tiny island of Tanna, which was devastated by Cyclone Pam in March 2015, is only half-an-hour away.However, up until the directors arrived on the island to discuss their idea for the project, most of the cast had never even seen a feature film before.""People are still wearing nambas [traditional penis sheath] ... and women wear grass skirts, hunt with bows and arrows,"" Dean said.But the people of Yakel are not worried about what their new-found fame could mean for their tiny community, an issue the directors had discussed with the village chiefs.""Essentially the chiefs said 'listen, this is something we welcome, we want people to come and learn, and if it simply gets too much we just shut down the roads,'"" Dean said.""They're proud of the fact that it's their film, made in their language, and it's been acknowledged in this way — they can't wait to share it with more people.""","Academy Awards (Oscars), Australia, Event, Film (Arts and Entertainment), Human Interest, Pacific, Vanuatu, ",2017-01-25T00:06:50+00:00

239,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2016-10-12/how-migrant-workers-are-critical-to-agriculture/7922368,"More than 900,000 immigrants on permanent and temporary visas enter Australia each year. Most live and work in Australian capital cities, and immigrants are more urbanised than the average Australian today.However, in the past decade or so, new visa pathways have opened up to attract new immigrant workers and their families to the Australian bush. Increased chances of selection attracts permanent skilled immigrants to accept employment in regional and rural towns.At the same time, increasing numbers of temporary migrants on working holiday, student and skilled 457 visas are attracted to the bush. A new program for Pacific Seasonal Workers has also been introduced.With that, immigrant workers add substantially to productivity in the agricultural industry, a new report reveals.For policymakers, the attraction of getting migrants to rural areas is that it helps reduce labour shortages — particularly during seasonal harvesting peaks — and counteracts the trend of population movement away from the bush to the metropolis.Immigrants, including refugees, play a critical role in the Australian agricultural industry. Some of these immigrants become entrepreneurs, opening up a business. Skilled immigrants in the agricultural sector were also much more likely to have set up their own business (15 per cent) than those in other industries (9.6 per cent).When set against the Australian average rate of entrepreneurship (those in the workforce who are self-employed or employers) of 10 per cent, this propensity for immigrant entrepreneurship in the Australian agricultural sector is very encouraging, since entrepreneurs drive employment and productivity growth in the industry.457 visa skilled workers find employers in the bush eager to sponsor their immigration application, particularly in professional and technical occupations. Working holiday makers fill critical jobs during harvesting and picking seasons.Seasonal workers from the Pacific are eager to supplement the income of their families back home via remittances. They also get to learn new skills.Immigrant farmers fill the growing intergenerational gap in farm succession and bring with them new technologies and innovations to Australian farming.For example, Zimbabwean immigrant Nicky Mann and her husband introduced hydroponic rose-growing at their NSW Central Coast operation. Vietnamese and Chinese market gardeners have introduced many new vegetables to expand Australians' food horizons.Australia takes in about half of all working holiday makers who enter OECD countries. They can work and travel around Australia from job to job. The carrot is a 12-month extension to their visa if they work more than 88 days in the bush. The agriculture, forestry and fishing industries receive the greatest benefit from this arrangement.Working holiday makers come from more than 20 countries. The UK, South Korea, Ireland, Germany, Taiwan and France provide the largest numbers. Fieldwork with Korean working holiday makers found the majority arrived with the intention of working in the agricultural industry.Most reported that the best thing about their experience was that they had good relations with the non-Koreans they worked with in Australia, learned new skills, had to opportunity to improve their English, and received good wages.The Pacific seasonal workers program allows workers from East Timor, Nauru, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu to work in low-skilled jobs for up to seven months in a 12-month period. Most work in the horticultural industry.The annual intake has grown from around 400 in 2010-11. It is now an uncapped, demand-driven immigration stream that has expanded to jobs in the broader agriculture industry — including the accommodation sector.Many permanent and temporary immigrants in the bush, particularly those who work in the agricultural industry, report receiving a warm welcome. This undermines existing stereotypes.Many skilled permanent immigrants report strong local connections through sporting, community, school and religious social activities in their regional, rural and remote towns.Those who work in the agricultural industry report a higher level of social engagement — with the exception of sporting activities — than do other immigrants.However, working holidaymakers had more than three times the rate of finalised Fair Work Ombudsman complaints compared to all other workers in 2013-14. This suggests a high incidence of exploitative work arrangements.The research also noted numerous examples over time of exploitation of temporary migrants on temporary student, skilled work, working holiday or Pacific Seasonal worker visas. Examples of co-ethnic exploitation are also common.The research does not clarify the extent to which temporary migrants working in agriculture experience exploitation. However, experiences of migrant worker exploitation do jeopardise future migrant flows into agricultural jobs.International migration decisions are often based on the experiences of friends and family around the world. This means that unscrupulous employers can undermine the benefits of migrant employment programs for the majority of Australian employers who provide appropriate pay and work conditions.Jock Collins is the Professor of Social Economics at UTS Business School.Originally published in The Conversation.","Agricultural Policy, Australia, China, Community and Society, Farm Labour, Federal Government, Immigration, Kiribati, Nauru, Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Vegetables, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, ",2016-10-11T20:12:34+00:00

At least 15 people were killed in the storm. One year on, the nation still faces many challenges.The leftover water in those creeks is what people are using now. They are basically drinking mud. There's no more running water.Cyclone Pam struck across most of the islands of Vanuatu with winds gusting at up to 320 kilometres per hour. Homes and structures were blown apart. But there was a surprisingly low loss of life.The people of Vanuatu suffer cyclones so regularly that their local knowledge on how to bunker down and survive is seemingly innate. Their subsistence crops, however, were decimated, with estimations that 90 per cent were lost. A lot of people in the remote areas have caves where they can go.Someone said it was like a giant whipper snipper had gone across and smashed thousands and thousands of strong, hardwood trees — just bent, smashed like matchsticks.Buildings, roads, infrastructure are flattened, but the people of Vanuatu are getting on with the job of cleaning up and the long road to recovery.A lot of the guys likened it to an artillery impact ... most of the trees were cut off at about waist height.A report from August 2015 put the financial toll of Cyclone Pam at $590 million, more than half of Vanuatu's yearly GDP. The figures are similar to the costs being touted now in devastated Fiji nearly a year to the day.Before the costs were counted though, in the initial days, weeks and months after March 13, assistance from its Pacific military partners and NGOs on the ground sought to re-establish the nation's basic needs.We have a lot of patients we see here, especially kids and children. We have a lot of malnutrition cases.As if a near-complete decimation of subsistence crops by the cyclone was not enough, Melanesia came to be caught in the grip of an El Nino-driven drought across Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.It continues to compound the destruction left behind by Cyclone Pam as water sources dry up, crops fail, and residents continue to survive on food handouts.Crops were devastated and are yet to fully recover. Here your food garden is your lifeline, so people in Vanuatu are now dealing with an overwhelming double crisis.On the one year anniversary of Cyclone Pam, aid organisations on the ground in Vanuatu continue to roll out drought assistance along with its post-cyclone response, even as other catastrophes strike the region.As the situation in Fiji and Cyclone Winston becomes clearer, many disaster management organisations are finding its issues are largely tracking along similar lines with those that Vanuatu faced, just one year ago.","Cyclone, Cyclones, Disaster Relief, Disasters and Accidents, Pacific, Vanuatu, ",2016-03-12T20:30:10+00:00

Whereas today if you come to Vanuatu, the people are obviously generally of Melanesian appearance. Darker skinned, and not as tall as Polynesians would be. These [the people buried in cemetery] were very tall Polynesians.""The skulls found at Teouma were similar in appearance and measurements to present day Polynesian and Asian populations.Professor Spriggs said this provided evidence that Polynesia was populated by people who came from Asia via Vanuatu.The next step is to examine DNA from the Teouma skeletons.""We're really working very hard on this at the moment ... we think we can. We're working on it with a team from Europe,"" Professor Spriggs said.He said DNA analysis could help confirm or discount the team's conclusions about the Teouma skeletons.""Or it could even narrow it down to where in South-East Asia these ancestors of the Polynesians, and these ancestors of the people in Vanuatu came from,"" he said.","ACT, Anthropology and Sociology, Archaeology, Australia, Canberra, Forensic Science, France, History, Science and Technology, Vanuatu, ",2015-12-29T05:03:08+00:00

People are struggling to grow crops, water sources are drying up and people are surviving on meagre food handouts. Hospital wards in Tanna are full of malnourished babies and their distraught mothers. Deborah, one of the mothers, said her main worry was the lack of food. She feeds her baby nutrient-rich milk supplied by the hospital.""The soil is very dry and we can't plant anything, the only water left is for drinking, there's no food,"" she said.Dr Robert Vocor, the hospital's medical superintendent, said the drought meant locally grown fruit and vegetables were scarce.As a result, many people were living on government handouts of rice, noodles and tinned fish. ""We have a lot of patients around here especially kids and children who have the problem with nutrition and we have a lot of malnutrition cases,"" he said.Dr Vocor said the emergency supplies do not have the nutrients growing babies need. The hospital treated 19 malnourished babies in recent weeks.""By six months we should be introducing solid foods to babies or children which them helps with the growth because they can't live by breast milk alone,"" he said.""But the problem with the El Nino thing, it's becoming a problem where we don't have the root crops.""

Before you had a big pool here and you have a big flow rate so everybody can have their water ... now as you see there is now water in this creek,"" he said.

They are building traditional cyclone shelters, low-set structures made of rough-hewn wood and thatched grass that they believe are stronger than bricks and mortar.

The only MP to be found not guilty was Robert Bohn, who was acquitted.Carcasses had said the payments were development loans, but justice Mary Sey did not accept that.She said the payments were corruptly made and corruptly received and designed to influence the MPs in their capacity as public officials. The convicted MPs, who make up more than half of the government, had their bail continued and were released.After the decision, Carcasses said outside court the conviction would be appealed. He also urged for calm.Several hundred people gathered outside the court compound to await the result, and security was tightened in the capital, Port Vila, on Friday. Some schools were closed.A paramilitary police rapid response unit was also placed on standby for signs of possible unrest.Local reports say prime minister Sato Kilman asked local chiefs to be on the alert and ""take precautionary measures"" to ensure the safety of people in Port Vila.Two other MPs were earlier given immunity to appear as witnesses of the public prosecutor in the case.On Thursday in a separate court, Vanuatu's chief justice Daniel Fatiaki ruled that the ombudsman's preliminary report into the bribery charges in relation to a second charge (under the leadership code) be ruled null and void, and thus not admissible in evidence.It is understood that the ombudsman failed to give the MPs a right of reply on the preliminary report before recommending the prosecutor lay charges.In September, Vanuatu finance minister Willie Jimmy was convicted on both bribery charges, for breaching the leadership and penal codes, after entering a guilty plea.All but Jimmy entered pleas of not guilty.Vanuatu politics is often paralysed by no-confidence motions and a high turnover of its leadership, with the money alleged to have been used to procure support before an attempt to remove the then-prime minister Joe Natuman.A no-confidence motion succeeded in removing Mr Natuman, who oversaw the relief work following Cyclone Pam, in June.Proceedings will resume next week for sentencing.","Bribery, Government and Politics, Law, Crime and Justice, Pacific, Prisons and Punishment, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2015-10-09T06:07:01+00:00

The drought is adding to the devastation caused by Cyclone Pam six months ago, with people in some parts forced to forage for food in the bush. Dr Jacob Kool from the World Health Organisation's office in Vanuatu said the girl from Tanna Island died from severe diarrhoea, which may have been caused by contaminated water or inedible food.""There is a severe food shortage on the island,"" he said.""People have been eating unusual food crops which they don't normally eat.""Some people say diarrhoea is caused by that.""There's also drought at the moment and as a result people are drinking unsafe water as well so it could just as well have been the drinking of unsafe water that caused an intestinal infection."" Dr Kool said he was aware of three more children suffering severe diarrhoea.""We also have a surveillance system that reports all kinds of cases of diseases and there has been an increase in the cases of diarrhoea for the last two weeks,"" he said. Tanna Island was one of the areas hardest hit by Cyclone Pam earlier this year. Houses were destroyed, food gardens were ripped up and high tides inundated sources of fresh water.An El Nino-driven drought is compounding the devastation caused by the category five storm. Charlie Damon from CARE International said her organisation has been distributing seeds and tools to communities on Tanna Island to get crops growing again. But Ms Damon said the dry weather since Cyclone Pam has hampered recovery efforts and some people have been forced to look for food in the bush. ""People are foraging in the forest for what's traditionally called bush rope which is just a root in the ground,"" she said.""Children are chewing on it and they are taking it as basically their lunch to go to school."" Vanuatu's government announced it will conduct another distribution of rice and tinned fish to affected communities, the fourth since the cyclone.  But Dr Kool said the move was ""only an emergency band aid"" and more was needed to avert another such disaster. ""I think all the aid agencies have to go back in there and double the effort. What's been done so far is not enough,"" he said.

Three years ago, after cultivating a few seeds from a single yam, Graham Daniels embarked on a new farming endeavour in the Tanolui community of Vanuatu's Shefa province. It proved so successful he is now harvesting three times a year, selling out of stock at the local market and sharing his expertise with others. Pauliane Bafil, a project coordinator with the UN Development Program (UNDP), is working with Mr Daniels and other farmers on a new knowledge-exchange scheme being rolled out in Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Fiji.Ms Bafil said the creation of knowledge hubs allowed individual farmers who had advanced knowledge, farming methods and resilient plant varieties that others might not have access to, to collaborate with each other.The networks brought these farmers together to share their successes and failures, encouraging them to share information, planting materials and to work together to trial sustainable or climate-resilient farming systems.Moortaza Jiwanji, the Pacific risk resilience program manager with the UNDP's Pacific Centre, said sharing knowledge strengthened the resilience of farming communities because they were experimenting with more techniques like mixing crops. ""If they're only growing one crop variety, they're very vulnerable. Whereas if you have a variety of crops, you enhance resilience for those communities,"" he said.""Another area is where people are actually sharing the [seedlings], so it's not just an exchange of information and techniques.""Mr Jiwanji said farmers saw the knowledge hubs as an opportunity and source of confidence.""Beforehand I think they were really struggling, but this is now an opportunity, a sign of hope for communities to actually come out of that by pooling together.""

The stories about how communities, particularly remote communities, really didn't have anything to eat in the aftermath of the disaster — particularly green leaf produce,"" he said.""That's a pattern we're seeing with extreme weather events. Now with climate change and more slow-onset events, like extended periods of drought and dry periods, it's reducing farming communities' ability to grow crops."" With growing support from local government and national agriculture ministries, there is speculation the hubs will develop new commercial and export ventures for the region.

And he said 'oh, in that case I'll plead guilty' to the shock of the entire court.""Of course, he could well turn up at the next hearing on Monday, with a lawyer present, and say 'look, I was confused, I didn't have legal counsel at the time and I'd like the plea changed'.""And I think the court would look fairly favourably at that.""The 18 MPs of the 52-seat parliament are alleged to have taken bribes from the now-deputy prime minister a year ago while in opposition.Carcasses has always stated the money was transferred to the parliamentarians as a loan, into their private accounts, for use in their constituencies.Vanuatu politics is often paralysed by no-confidence motions and a high turnover of its leadership, and the money is alleged to have been used to procure support before an attempt to remove the then-prime minister Joe Natuman.A no-confidence motion succeeded in removing Mr Natuman, who oversaw the relief work following Cyclone Pam, on June 11.Four of the MPs were previously understood to have been given immunity to appear as witnesses of the public prosecutor, including the current internal affairs minister.But Mr Wilson said even that status was now unclear.""Two of those are publically stating they don't know why their charges have been withdrawn and they've made no deal with the prosecution,"" he said.The trial is expected to begin on Monday next week.","Corruption, Courts and Trials, Government and Politics, Law, Crime and Justice, Pacific, Parliament, Vanuatu, ",2015-09-02T11:40:31+00:00

Even George Clooney is rumoured. But among the mix of some of Hollywood's most famous, you will find an unlikely group of stars this year.Life on Tanna has been lived almost exactly as it has been for thousands of years.But the Yakel people, one of the South Pacific's last traditional tribes, are the cast and most of the crew for feature film Tanna which will premiere at the Critics' Week in Venice.The Yakel society is cashless and supports itself. Up until two years ago, the people had never seen a movie.Now, they're the stars of one.Lingai, Selin, Wawa and Dain had never left their jungle village until the film's co-director's, Bentley Dean and Martin Butler, flew them to Sydney ahead of their Venice debut.Their arrival in Australia, along with JJ, who played a key role in translating and facilitating the making of the film, has been long anticipated.Their first day in Australia is filled with other firsts.They get in their first elevator, use their first seat belt, experience their first tunnel and are impressed by the first tall buildings they've ever seen.Selin, 8, and her father Lingai are amazed at how the traffic lights direct cars through the city and out to Butler's home at Bondi Beach.There, unsurprisingly, the Tanna locals seem most at home outside, though the sight of some fake plastic birds in the garden sends them all into a fit of laughter.While making the film, Tanna's directors lived with the families in the Yakel tribe in their huts.One film and a year later, some of the Yakel are sitting a world away in a Bondi home, learning how to play pool and catching Butler up on the local Vanuatu news.""I never thought I would be in your house,"" Lingai says to him, despite many conversations over the past year about visiting.""My eyes have been opened wide.""They each brought only a single backpack, one full of the costumes they're hoping to show off in Venice, so shopping for some supplies and warmer clothes is a priority.Walking through the shops, JJ translates their reactions, which largely focus on the range and amount of food, from ""how do you decide what to eat?"" to ""we will be eating a big dinner tonight"".This is a stark contrast to their food situation at home, which JJ says has become scarce since Tanna experienced the full force of Cyclone Pam earlier this year.Tanna's 30,000 residents have run out of relief food and are surviving on rice, while planting almost anything in the hope that something will grow.Tanna is based on a true story about a young girl who runs away from an arranged marriage to join her lover, triggering a tribal war.The scenery is gorgeous and epic, with an active volcano the central setting.The script was co-written by the people of Yakel and the cast speak their tribal language, Nauvhal.""The film is our film. We made it ourselves,"" JJ tells Lateline.Wawa and Dain play the couple at the centre of the love story, which ultimately ends in tragedy.""Lovers started to commit suicide because of the difficulty in accepting arranged marriage,"" JJ says.""We realised that we must do something to keep the custom alive and to keep the future generations living happily.""We made this film to teach the world how to accept good decisions, that will help people in their lives, or to accept changes, that will also help to improve the lives of the people.""Butler says they remain true to the culture and belief systems on Tanna.""The film is utterly unique,"" he says.""It gives you an insight into a world that has never been seen on cinema features before.""","Anthropology and Sociology, Arts, Culture and Entertainment, Australia, Carnivals and Festivals, Film (Arts and Entertainment), Italy, Romance Films, Vanuatu, ",2015-09-08T08:30:46+00:00

288,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-16/new-format-the-key-to-a-brighter-future-for-pacific-hockey/6625836,"There is a new sport in town at the Pacific Games in Papua New Guinea — after rugby sevens, Twenty20 cricket and rugby league nines, now comes hockey fives. And those charged with running the sport in the Pacific say it could be the saviour of game.Hockey has only featured in the Pacific Games on three previous occasions, and until Port Moresby there has never been a tournament for both men and women.The reasons for that are straightforward: hockey has never been a heavy hitter on the sporting scene in the region.It is expensive to take an 18 player squad to compete in an international tournament and most Pacific countries cannot afford to do it.In recent times, Fiji's men's and women's teams qualified to play in the next stage of the World League, but neither side went because there was no money to send them. But with five-a-side hockey the picture is very different. Half the number of players are required, so naturally costs are significantly reduced as well. Hence five teams have made it to PNG and the hope is more will follow at future Pacific Games. Fiji's team manager Senimili Rose said hockey fives make perfect sense.""We're just happy to be involved instead of being left out of the Games as has so often been the case in the past,"" she said.""This new format makes it more affordable in terms of preparations, getting athletes to the competition, getting proper uniforms. ""It just makes things easier on people's pockets because we all struggle financially.""For the team from Vanuatu to suggest that getting to Port Moresby was a struggle would be an understatement. In the wake of Cyclone Pam, their hockey facilities were devastated and women's team captain Mary Siro said the team had been doing it tough.""The cyclone destroyed our field so our training was badly disrupted. We had to be bussed as a team to a temporary base, and it hit our finances hard,"" Ms Siro said.""We had only two months to prepare for the Pacific Games because the repairs to our field will be expensive and will take a long time.""But all the teams at the hockey fives tournament are learning to adapt to the new format, so Vanuatu have not entirely been left behind. The Fiji squad may have an edge, having played five-a-side hockey in the past, but only indoors, not outdoors on the brand new all-weather surface in PNG. With just a goalkeeper and four outfield players on each team, hockey fives is fast, near enough non-stop and you can shoot from anywhere.Matches are played over three 12-minute periods (with just a couple of two-minute breaks), and boards all around the field mean the ball is constantly in play. Good crowds have turned up to get a first glimpse of hockey fives and they seem to like what they see.PNG women's coach Ossie Kekesan says his players have really taken to this new form of the game.""It's a new concept to us and we only started playing last year, before our new centre was ready. But the girls have picked it up very quickly, and they love it, once they start playing, they don't want to stop,"" he said.When the Pacific Games are over Kekesan wants hockey officials to keep the momentum going.""This concept I think can be great driver for hockey in the Pacific and we should have an annual tournament and involve as many Pacific islands as possible,"" he said. ""It's ideal for schools and getting kids involved. We'd like everybody to get behind us, especially our federations. That would be great.""But more immediately there are Pacific Games gold medals to be won, and the hockey medals will be among the last to be decided on the final day of the Games on Saturday. So expect big crowds because every medal counts and for the host nation in particular, as PNG strives to take the Pacific Games crown away from New Caledonia.

""Who knows what is going to happen next.""Where the discrepancy appears to have been picked up from what I understand is that he is not eligible to play for New Zealand until he has spent five years in that country after the age of 18.""But he is 20 years old so he hasn't fulfilled that criteria.""The 20-year-old Wynne has played for the senior All Whites side, as well as playing in the under-20 World Cup recently held in New Zealand.ABC/wires","Fiji, New Zealand, Pacific, Soccer, Sport, Summer Olympic Games, Vanuatu, ",2015-07-12T04:58:38+00:00

The campaign by Australian cotton growers was launched in March, soon after the cyclone devastated the Pacific island nation. More than 1600 tarpaulins were collected, most of them by growers in southern Queensland. Now the Australian aid organisation which distributed the tarpaulins has sent back photos to Cotton Australia to show how the tarpaulins - which would previously have been used to cover square module cotton bales - are being given a new life in Vanuatu. ""Just the other day we got some photos back from Vanuatu and here they are being used for fixing up the roofs of houses and churches and providing temporary shelters for people and it was just heart warming to see all that effort going to such a good cause,"" said Cotton Australia CEO Adam Kay. ""The growers are pretty chuffed, just to have this all come together so quickly and then to see the benefits for the people that have been affected was just tremendous,"" he said. Mr Kay paid tribute to the other organisations who assisted Cotton Australia's efforts. ""Other parts of the industry - transport companies and other people - assisted in getting those tarps into containers and getting them down to the port so it was a whole community effort to make this happen,"" he said. ""To see those big beaming smiles on people's faces, standing out the front of their huts that have got a cotton module tarp over them was just fantastic.""While growers donated the tarpaulins, Australian charity Act for Peace was responsible for collecting the tarps and working with local Christian churches to distribute them to those in need.Aid worker Tracey Robinson was on the ground to help distribute the tarpaulins and remains in Vanuatu working for the relief effort.  ""The churches have a very large outreach and as a result of that we did the distribution through the church leaders within each of the communities to ensure that those tarpaulins were used at a community level and not just at an individual household level,"" she said. Ms Robinson said the tarpaulins have made an enormous difference to the local people as they struggle to recover from the cyclone. ""For a start, they were a really good quality, they were really thick which was very different from a lot of the other tarpaulins that were coming over through other donations,"" she said. ""What that means is that they're strong and they can withstand wind and rain. They were also long...which meant that they could cover big spaces, so they were used to cover churches, they were used to cover schools and also the community built frames and put [the tarps] over so they had a big community space to sit under while they were waiting for repairs to their own homes.""Ms Robinson said two months on from Cyclone Pam the recovery was going well. ""Things are starting to change,"" she said.

""I think in some ways the intergenerational nature of violence is intuitive: we as children mimic the behaviour of the adults,"" she told Radio Australia's Pacific Beat program.You would think that during a time of pregnancy, there would be some protection of women from violence, but what we find is that's not the case.""So the child that grows up in a household where violence is a normal way of dealing with stress and conflict, and will grow up to mimic that behaviour as they get older.""

Dr Kool told ABC's Pacific Beat removing sites was ""going to be very challenging"" following the devastation caused by Cyclone Pam, which killed at least 11 people last month.""Breeding sites could be any cracked coconut, for example, and there's a lot of debris like that — things that collect water where mosquitoes can breed,"" he said.Zika was first discovered in 1947 in Rhesus Monkeys in Uganda's Zika forest.""Zika is a very strange story ... it had caused only about 20 known human cases until 2007, when there was suddenly 6,000 cases on the island of Yap in the North Pacific,"" Dr Kool said.The symptoms usually last four to seven days.The mild symptoms and similarity to other illnesses may have been the reason for the low number of confirmed cases.""In hindsight, we think zika has always been confused for dengue in many countries,"" Dr Kool said.""So zika virus may have been around and always misdiagnosed for dengue.""In the aftermath of Cyclone Pam, medical teams reported several cases of pink eye to the WHO.

So I'm quite worried personally about their futures.""So a lot of people there would be able to survive with the food rations that are being distributed,"" he said.""I managed to speak to a lot of people there, they seem to have ... for example the yams are still intact.""But for the outer islands for example, the Shefa, those islands are quite small and so they would probably need a lot more attention in terms of food rations.""The UN said a further $20 million is needed to help Vanuatu recover.Housing is another concern with the UN estimating 6,000 people are still living in temporary shelters.Many of the leaves and timber used for traditional thatches and house building were destroyed a month ago, and Mr Manassah appealed to the international community to send more permanent emergency shelters.""Send some tarpaulins, they were useful, but not so useful in the longer term,"" he said.""And so we are, I think the prime minister has asked for more support in that regard in terms of more tents coming in to help people so they could probably establish themselves.""The hardships are particularly tough for Vanuatu's children, said the Vanuatu country director for Save the Children, Tom Skirrow.""The children are always the most vulnerable in these sorts of circumstances, parents are trying to rebuild their homes and children are left alone,"" he said.""There's a lot of areas where [school] buildings have been destroyed.""I mean obviously with the food and water needs, children are more susceptible to disease, such as diarrhoea when water isn't clean.""So I'm quite worried personally about their futures.""Mr Skirrow said international help was making a difference, but said Vanuatu must not drop off the radar.""I think what's worrying me slightly is that international assistance will close down and somewhat stop,"" he said.""Obviously everything is being coordinated with the Vanuatu government but the needs of the people and the children and trying to get back to a life that [they] knew four, five weeks ago, in terms of their supply of food, supply of water, their housing, their public institutions like hospitals - so much of this has been just completely wiped out.""Mr Manassah said less than half of the money pledged at the time of the cyclone had actually been received by the country's finance ministry.""The government is hoping that those countries that pledged to give assistance will honour those pledges,"" he said.Meanwhile, in the neighbouring island nation of Tuvalu aid agencies are still assisting with Cyclone Pam recovery efforts.The Red Cross and other aid agencies have sent a ship filled with volunteers and emergency supplies to Tuvalu's northern islands.Massive tides caused by the cyclone caused severe damage to the low-lying islands.A volunteer aboard the ship, Rosemarie North, said huge waves also hit a coastal graveyard.""It sent human remains, bones, up and down the coast and through people's homes, actually, onto the roads,"" she said.""What it's done is left them really nervous about going fishing or eating any poultry or pigs or anything they think might have come close to those human bones.""","Cyclones, Disaster Relief, Pacific, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, ",2015-04-13T08:08:59+00:00

""So, the short term recovery efforts are well in hand, but the longer term recovery efforts - including restoring their economy which has been so badly battered by the impact of this cyclone - will be the centre of discussions.""International help has poured into Vanuatu in the 11 days since Cyclone Pam devastated the archipelago.The United Nations said it had raised around $10 million, as well as bilateral support form neighbouring countries.On Tuesday it launched an urgent appeal for nearly $30 million more to provide life-saving assistance, including food, water, health care and shelter to people in all of the affected areas, covering 22 of Vanuatu's 80 islands.Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Birch is leading the Australian Defence Force recovery team in Vanuatu. He told ABC's The World the ADF team is facing challenges getting to some of the more remote islands, but military assets in the archipelago were getting help to many who had been isolated.""The Defence Force is gladly committing resources to help one of our closest neighbours,"" Lieutenant Colonel Birch said.""We're moving food stores, humanitarian assistance products such as hygiene kits and medical stores.""But also we've got some elements of army engineers here and they're really good at assisting to clean up roads and to open roads for access to some of these areas.""They're doing some assessments on buildings to make sure they're safe, particularly things like schools so that we can return life to a bit of normalcy.""In a happy tale of survival, or sheer luck, seven men caught up in bad weather caused by Cyclone Pam have washed up in Solomon Islands after 13 days adrift.The men from Papua New Guinea said they had been transporting cargo for the Ministry of Agriculture between the islands of Misima and Woodlark in PNG's eastern Milne Bay Province when their small boat ran out of petrol.They did not have a GPS or even any life jackets on board, surviving on raw sweet potato and rain water.The fibreglass outboard motorboat drifted more than 500 kilometres before washing up on Rendova Island, in the Western Province of Solomon Islands.The acting head of PNG's High Commission in Honiara, Tommy Angau, told Radio Australia's Pacific Beat a representative of Papua New Guinea's defence force had spoken with them.""They are all in good condition after they were rescued,"" he said.""We are preparing for them to be flown to Honiara.""Then on Saturday, they will be flown to Port Moresby and then to Misima.""Vanuatu's two communications companies, Telecom Vanuatu and Digicel, said they had now restored 80 per cent of the country's network.Simon Fraser, the chief executive of Digicel Vanuatu, said its national network was restored in just five days.He told Pacific Beat it was not an easy task but the company expected to bring up several more towers in the next couple of days.""It's critical that people are able to communicate with their friends and families after something like the cyclone, so right now we're very pleased with what we've been able to do to date,"" he said.Mr Fraser said not much could be done in the face of a category five cyclone to prevent damage.""We've built considerable resilience into our network prior to the cyclone,"" he said.""But when the cyclone hit, it can take out full cell sites.""We've had, for instance, one of our powers in Erromango completely destroyed, actually knocked to the ground, and that was a 50-metre steel tower built very, very strongly.""So we're starting to work on what additional resilience we can build into our network.""Meanwhile, the UN's children's fund said schools have officially reopened, but 80 per cent of school buildings were damaged in the storm.However, it warned children, especially those in the hardest-to reach islands, were in serious danger.UNICEF's Pacific Representative Karen Allen said in a statement there was a ""significant risk of disease"" due to the acute water shortages, limited medical care and poor sanitation.","Cyclones, Defence and National Security, Disaster Relief, Disasters and Accidents, Pacific, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, ",2015-03-25T00:59:12+00:00

Packing winds of up to 250 kilometres per hour, the category-five system caused widespread devastation in Vanuatu's southern provinces of Shefa and Tafea.Around 75,000 people were left in need of emergency shelter, and 96 per cent of food crops were destroyed. But remarkably, there were just 11 confirmed fatalities. Why so few? Many development experts agree it was due to a combination of traditional knowledge, improved communications technology and disaster preparedness.Since people first settled in Vanuatu thousands of years ago, they have been dealing with cyclones. They know how to cope. Most houses are constructed with traditional materials such as bamboo, local timber and pandanus for the roof. What contributes to the low death toll is the fact that the materials are not so heavy.These materials can usually be sourced from a family's garden and can be relatively easily reconstructed.""What contributes to the low death toll is the fact that the materials are not so heavy,"" Margaret Rodman, Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at New York University in Toronto said.""So you're not dealing with masonry falling on people.""Professor Rodman, author of Home in the Islands: Housing and Social Change in the Pacific, said the traditional communal houses, nakamals, which are common throughout the island nation, are designed to withstand the pressure of a cyclone.""The roofs come down to the ground, which means the hurricane winds cannot get under the roof and lift it off.""Dan McGarry, chief technologist at the Port Vila-based think-tank Pacific Institute of Public Policy, agreed.""They're lashed together rather than nailed together and that gives the building the ability to flex,"" he said.""The walls and roofing materials are somewhat porous so they don't create these huge pressure differences that you see in modern structures.""For the first time, Vanuatu used an SMS warning system to alert people of the approaching cyclone. Text messages, containing condensed versions of warnings from the national meteorology service, were sent every three hours as the cyclone intensified. The messages were then sent hourly as the cyclone came closer to making landfall. For many in the outer islands, it was their only way of knowing where the cyclone was. Technical problems at the national broadcaster meant emergency radio bulletins were only reaching some of Vanuatu's 65 inhabited islands. Kiery Manassah, a spokesman for the prime minister's office, said he had no doubt the messages had saved lives. ""I had the opportunity to go to some of the islands that were affected. I asked them about how they got the information and most of them, especially in Shefa and outer islands, said they got the information from the SMS alerts,"" he said.Mr Manassah said the technology would likely be used for future disasters.""Penetration of mobile phones in Vanuatu is quite high, I would estimate almost 100 per cent, probably between 80 and 90 per cent of people, have access to mobile phones so it's a very useful means of communicating critical information to people.""The Red Cross in Vanuatu spends a lot of time training people in the community to prepare for cyclones. They teach people techniques to secure houses, prepare food gardens and store emergency food. They also explain how to develop evacuation plans and identify those in the community most at risk during a time of disaster. A team of community volunteers are also taught how to interpret warnings from the national weather bureau. ""Most of the communities said they followed preventative measures,"" Augustine Garae, disaster management coordinator for the Vanuatu Red Cross, said.""With some of traditional knowledge, that basically saved their lives.""","Cyclones, Indigenous Culture, Pacific, Storms, Vanuatu, ",2015-04-01T01:17:17+00:00

Category five Cyclone Pam hit the Pacific archipelago on March 13 and 14, flattening large swathes of the country.The United Nations estimated half of Vanuatu's population had been affected by the cyclone and the livelihoods of 80 per cent of those living in rural areas had been severely compromised.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said 166,000 people were estimated to need food aid for the next three months.It said most evacuation centres on the most populous island, Efate, could be closed if emergency shelter and food aid was distributed in communities of origin.The UN identified Mataso, part of the Shepherd Islands, as having the most urgent needs as it was hit particularly hard. Cyclone Pam destroyed all shelter and trees on the island and more tarpaulins were desperately needed.OCHA said infants were falling sick because of overexposure to the sun.A United Nations Pacific representative, Osnat Lubrani, said food and water supplies were reaching those who needed it most.""Yesterday, a boat carrying five tonnes of food arrived in the Shepherd Islands and began producing 10,000 litres of safe drinking water and it's going to supply clean drinking water and medical care to six islands,"" she said.Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop pledged long-term support for Vanuatu during a visit yesterday to the capital Port Vila, where she toured the command centre for cyclone relief efforts. She said the impact of Cyclone Pam had been devastating and widespread and Australia had responded quickly to requests from the government of Vanuatu, sending more than 11 military planes with equipment, lifesaving supplies and humanitarian support personnel.""Buildings, roads, infrastructure are flattened, but the people of Vanuatu are getting on with the job of cleaning up and the long road to recovery,"" she said.""I was delighted to see so many Australians on the ground, working with the local people in rebuilding houses, putting schools back together.""We had a medical team at Port Vila who, since last Sunday, have treated about 600 people.""Ms Bishop urged Australians to travel to Vanuatu once the initial crisis was over and use their tourist dollars to help rebuild the country.She said Australia would consider helping by expanding work opportunities for Vanuatu citizens as well as the $10 million of aid already pledged. Ms Bishop's offer of ongoing support came in a meeting with Vanuatu's prime minister Joe Natuman. A handful of schools in Vanuatu will open their doors to hundreds of students today, 10 days after Cyclone Pam tore across the country.About 500 schools were damaged or destroyed during the storm.Two schools will open in the capital Port Vila, while up to 10 others will also open on the island of Efate.The Marshall Islands president Christopher Loeak said stronger cyclones in the Pacific meant the world was in for a ""constant climate catastrophe"".Mr Loeak said Cyclone Pam was a stark reminder of the vulnerability of small island states to climate change.He told Radio Australia the Marshall Islands and nearby Pacific nations were faced with serious climate change threats.""More and more places, especially the most vulnerable, especially the Marshall Islands, will be hit by these strong disasters,"" he said.""Climate change is the the number one threat to our economy now and our security and livelihood.""Mr Loeak said the conviction that climate change was caused by pollution was widespread and held in powerful circles.He said the Pacific was taking heart from moves within the biggest polluting countries to address carbon pollution.He said an emergency meeting of the Alliance of Small Island States to be held this week will consider offering ongoing assistance to Vanuatu, in acknowledgement of the damage caused by the most powerful cyclone ever to hit the country.""Despite our size and our economies, I think we are all doing our part not only to coordinate efforts but also to highlight the problem that we're facing with our small countries.""

Ms Prendergast said most of the farming in Vanuatu was done on a subsistence basis and therefore the scale of the damage caused by the cyclone could cause serious food security issues.""I'm estimating about 80 per cent of the islands of Vanuatu have been wiped out of food crops, everybody grows their own food with the odd bit of rice purchased, particularly in the outer islands,"" she said.""Two crops have been entirely destroyed, all the root vegetable crops and almost all the fruit trees have been blown over, so they're not even going to be able to be harvested in a few years, we're talking another five years before they're up and running.""We think there's about a weeks worth of food lying on the ground that people will be able to salvage and eat and there's an allocation of five kilograms of rice, tinned fish, a tin of beef and a couple of packets of noodles per person for the next 15 days as a first emergency ration and that's what people are going to have to survive on.""The world food program and food aid is starting to arrive in the country so Ms Prendergast said making sure it gets out to some of the isolated islands where there had been little to no communication would need to be a priority.In other aid, Cotton Australia has already collected 900 tarps from people in the cotton areas of southern Queensland and Moree in northern NSW to be sent to Vanuatu to be used as temporary shelter.","Agribusiness, Agricultural Crops, Disasters and Accidents, Toowoomba, Vanuatu, ",2015-03-23T06:04:14+00:00

In the days after the storm, with communications down, manager Michael Benjamin and his staff simply drove around looking for people who needed help.He said the community response to the storm had been inspiring.""The people are just simply amazing. I can't believe the amount of work that these local people are putting in and how quickly they've got the roads clear and electricity on and water on. It's just pretty impressive.""Having been stretched by the demands after the storm, Promedical has set up a fundraising page so it can continue to provide an effective service.Meanwhile, a week on from Cyclone Pam, communities in Vanuatu are on the brink of running out of food and water as aid agencies and local authorities grapple with meeting the immense need.The Vanuatu government estimates that more than 100,000 people have been made homeless by the storm, and not all communities have yet been reached.Foreign minister Julie Bishop is expected to visit Vanuatu this weekend to see what further help Australia can offer.The storm, which struck a week ago today, has left the people shocked, homeless and unsure of what to do next.Cooper Henry, a school teacher from Northern Effate, said the people were catching and eating flying foxes and birds.""Things are getting expensive, rice, the main food in town, is getting expensive. We are trying to find something else like flying bats, flying foxes...We also ate birds. It's so sad, they too want to live but somehow since they are under our management so we just have to kill.""Food in Vanuatu comes mostly from small gardens but they have been completely wiped out and will take months or years to re-establish.It is also emerging that some communities near the coast are dealing with more than wind damage.Takara village in Effate's North and the neighbouring island of Emao both experienced a storm surge that wiped out most of the houses.Chief Robbie Peter, who heads Takara, a village of around 350 people, is grappling with their need for food, water and shelter, having lost everything himself.He said the wave went over the top of his house.The government is determined to co-ordinate the distribution of aid to avoid a fragmented approach due to the number of agencies on the ground.It is hoped that negotiations between agencies and authorities will allow the movement of aid to be accelerated in coming days.","Australia, Babies, Charities, Cyclones, Disasters and Accidents, Vanuatu, ",2015-03-20T07:23:42+00:00

""I have conferred with senior staff of the ombudsman's office and especially the principle legal officer, and looking at the Ombudsman's Act myself there's nothing at all in the Ombudsman's Act referring to the power of a president to suspend an ombudsman,"" he said.""I am still the ombudsman of Vanuatu, and I am in the throes of writing a letter to the head of state to seek his advice on the allegations of the acting president, previously.""Under Vanuatu law, the speaker acts as president when the latter is travelling overseas and has the powers of pardoning, commutation and reduction of sentences.President Baldwin Lonsdale returned to Port Vila late Sunday afternoon, ending Mr Pipite's acting role.Professor Cheryl Saunders, from Melbourne University's law school, said that while the pardon appears to be constitutional, it remains to be seen whether the decision can be overturned by a court.""There is a provision in the constitution that allows the president to pardon people who have been convicted, and the section appears to be unrestricted in the sense that it doesn't prevent a president pardoning himself or herself,"" Ms Saunders said.""So if the speaker is standing in the shoes of the president, the speaker has power to perform all the president's functions, so on the face of the constitution it seems to be allowed, extraordinary it may be.""On the other hand, you can ask yourself 'are there any subtle legal arguments that might enable for this decision to be attacked, is there an argument based on separation of powers ... or is there some sort of argument based on bias' — the principle that says a person may not be judge in his own court.""Vanuatu finance minister Willie Jimmy, who pleaded guilty, did not have his conviction overturned in the announcement.In 2004, then-Vanuatu president Alfred Maseng Nalo refused to use his special powers to pardon himself of his criminal conviction.An anti-corruption group in Vanuatu has blasted a minister's decision as ""a national disgrace"".Jenny Ligo, the chair of Women Against Crime and Corruption, said it is ""a national disgrace"" and her group is planning a march to express their feelings.""This is not on.

""We've been doing a huge amount of work, both in water and sanitation,"" she said.""One of the immediate needs after the typhoon was ensuring that people really were practising good hygiene practices.""We began by doing shelter repair for providing corrugated iron, and cash grants to people whose houses were partially damaged."" But 16 months later, replacing the houses which were completely destroyed has taken time. ""We are training up volunteers locally ... to ensure that the next time an emergency comes, there are teams ready to respond and help communities to evacuate and be prepared before the typhoon strikes,"" Ms Gearing said.The Victorian Black Saturday fires of February 2009 were the worst in Australia's history.Hundreds of houses burnt down, thousands of hectares of farmland were destroyed and 173 people died.For Stan and Robyn Banbury, the majority of their 170 hectare property near Marysville was destroyed by fire. In a class action which was run by law firm Maurice Blackburn, it was alleged the fire was sparked by a break in an electrical conductor on a power pole.The Banburys and others in the Marysville-Murrindindi community have been waiting six years for compensation and clarity on what happened that day. A $300 million settlement was finally reached in February with the electricity company AusNet.""The fact is that all of the property lost and the environment burnt and the amount of people killed by this fire, we're punishing them to a degree and that makes me feel that they are actually accountable .... and they're been nailed for it,"" Mr Banbury said.But the Banburys believe it will be almost two years before they see any of the money. ""We'll never get back to where we were. But a little bit of money will allow us to get some professional help in and some much needed materials,"" he said. When disaster strikes, some people are more resilient than others, but experts say that disasters can have serious impacts on a person's mental health.""We know from the research ... that about one in five people who have lived through a disaster will experience some sort of psychological distress,"" said Beyond Blue chief executive Georgie Harman.Survivor guilt and dealing with anniversaries every year can compound that.""You shouldn't feel guilty, this is usually a freak act of nature or a situation that you find yourself in for no fault of your own,"" Ms Harman said.It is something emergency workers, like firefighters have increasingly acknowledged in recent years.Research shows firefighters are more likely to suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of what they see and decisions made during fires and incidents like car crashes.Paul Edbrooke, a Victoria state politician who was a firefighter for almost 14 years, was on the frontline during Victoria's Black Saturday fires.""I've been lucky enough not to experience PTSD - so far so good,"" he said.""But I have witnessed many colleagues who haven't come out the other side quite right. We've had some really tragic circumstances happen. ""We've also had quite a few people who've never entered the fire service again; they've quit their job.""But Mr Edbrooke said times were changing.""I think the time when I started it was a bit of a macho pride issue for a lot of people,"" he said.""And the really good thing about how far we've grown as a fire service is that ... people now seek help, it's quite normal to talk about these things"".When a tsunami struck Japan's coastline just over four years ago, hundreds of children became orphans.Parents were killed as they searched for children, many of whom were still at school when the magnitude nine earthquake struck.Educational programs are now teaching children important life-saving lessons. Save the Children have used manga cartoons to teach children survival techniques.""We don't know when a tsunami or earthquake [may] happen,"" said Save the Children's Disaster Risk Reduction Education Manager, Masako Ota.""Sometimes children might be alone at that time but they have to make their own decisions.""

349,https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2015-03-17/vanuatu-damage-and-recovery-of-forestry-fisheries/6324724,"Vanuatu's fruit and vegetable crops, livestock and fisheries have suffered extensive damage from Cyclone Pam.While trees are expected to bounce back within a couple of years, the island nation's coral reefs and fish stocks might take a decade to recover.The Vanuatu Department of Food and Security said the banana crop throughout the country had been destroyed and most coconuts had been felled.All fruit trees, including citrus and avocados, were stripped, and root and leaf vegetable crops were flooded or uprooted.The department also said many small livestock, including chickens and pigs, had been killed, and pens and shelters destroyed.Some of the worst damage was to fisheries infrastructure, with canoes, small boats and fishing gear destroyed, and reefs wrecked by rough seas.Nearly 200,000 people - 80 per cent of Vanuatu's population - are subsistence farmers, leaving them extremely vulnerable.The Vanuatu Government said farmers desperately needed help with replanting their gardens and orchards, and replacing their lost seed stocks.Australia runs agricultural aid programs to build the local economy with sandalwood, native Canarium tree nuts, whitewood timber and cocoa trees. All suffered extensive damage.Tony Bartlett, from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), said trees would recover quite quickly, but coral reefs would take longer to repair.""The aquaculture facilities they've established which are located very close to the sea front will have taken quite a hammering because of the storm surges,"" he said.""Cyclonic winds tend to destroy the coral reefs.""They eventually come back, but it takes ten to fifteen years to be highly productive again.""Not only do people lose their shelters and homes, but also their gardens and livelihoods.""The whitewood is a fast growing native timber that ACIAR is helping Forestry Vanuatu develop. It loses all its leaves in a strong wind, which makes it cyclone resistant.""That stops the bulk of the tree crown being pushed so hard in the wind that the top snaps off, so it generally comes back relatively quickly after a cyclone,"" Mr Bartlett said.""We've been working to breed better quality whitewood trees and encouraging farmers to grow them.""The Canarium nut grows throughout the Pacific Islands and tends to be knocked around a bit more.""It means in the short term there won't be so many nuts to sell,"" Mr Bartlett said.""Sandalwood are smaller trees and they won't have been as severely damaged.""Cocoa is also prone to damage by strong winds, but it can recover quickly and produce more fruit the next year.""The people who grow cocoa have quite good niche markets in Australia with Haigh's chocolates and another specialty producer in Margaret River,"" Mr Bartlett said.""We've been helping set up those links.""Australia delivers $60 million worth of aid to Vanuatu, including education, health, legal and infrastructure. The aid for agriculture research is small but focused.Mr Bartlett said ACIAR was scheduled to start another project in July on value-adding to the Canarium tree nut, called Nangai or Nagae.""With a bit of luck, some of these can create livelihoods that can help people rebuild their lives, which is much more sustainable than other aid,"" he said.The full extent of damage to coffee plantations on Tanna, one of the worst-hit islands, is not yet known.Coffee is Tanna's largest export crop, with almost a quarter of the green beans imported by Australian roasters. Tanna Coffee Plantations' director Mike Pole said this year Tanna was planning for its best crop in 150 years of production. ""We were expecting more than 120 tonnes from the island, which is equivalent to $550,000 to $600,000,"" he said.""Most of these farmers are happy if they get $1,000 a year.""There are an estimated 180 hectares to 240 hectares of land under coffee on the island. ""There'd be probably 600 to 900 growers, if not more, but again, these people are subsistence-livers, so they share their labour around quite freely,"" Mr Pole said.Mr Pole hoped that at least 30 to 40 per cent of the crop could still be harvested. ""But I've never been or seen some place that's gone through 300 kilometres per hour wind for a sustained period, so I've got no idea,"" he said.""When they had the last cyclone, coffee was one of the plants that survived, because it's a very carbonated plant, it's very, very hard.""It can withstand a lot, and the coffee will bounce back very quickly. It's a tap-rooted plant, so even in the ash, which is what Tanna is, it'll be deeply rooted.""There will be breakages ,but it will spring back like a weed pretty quick.""Mr Pole said it could take several years for the industry to fully recover.""If the trees are going to bounce back, it'll be a two-year process, because if they were really badly hit and they have to regrow, because they've got no new growth coming on it'll regenerate this year and get a very small harvest of the plants next year,"" he said. ""It'll be four years before the industry will be back into full speed, I think."" Meanwhile, a report from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation said nearly a quarter of damages wrought by natural disasters on the developing world were borne by the agriculture sector.Drought, floods, storms or tsunamis cost agriculture $70 billion over 10 years between 2003-2013.FAO reported Asia was the most affected region.Two and a half billion people, who depend on agriculture as small-scale farmers, herders, fishers and foresters, produce over half the world's agricultural production.The report found that despite the extent of damage, only 4.5 per cent of the post-disaster aid in those ten years targeted agriculture.","Canberra, Disaster Relief, Fishing, Aquaculture, Forestry, Fruit, Vanuatu, ",2015-03-17T01:56:04+00:00

In addition to the two dozen confirmed dead, more than 30 people have been injured according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).The latest fatalities included a teenage boy and his mother killed by flying debris and two women who were killed when they were crushed by the wall of a church they were sheltering in.Director of the prime minister's office, Benjamin Shing, said aerial assessments of parts of Shefa province showed salt water had swept across the populated area.Flights over Vanuatu's southern island of Tanna also confirmed widespread destruction of houses and crops, with aid agencies saying conditions are among the most challenging they have ever faced.""There will be extensive injuries if the people didn't go to higher ground and there might be a lot of fatalities,"" Mr Shing said.He said up to 70 per cent of the country's population may have been displaced by Cyclone Pam and many parts of the island chain remained cut off from phone lines.Vanuatu's population of more than a quarter of a million had been living in 69,000 households.Donations can be made to the Australian Red Cross Tropical Cyclone Pam Appeal on their website""And out of the 69,000, we are saying that 70 per cent is displaced,"" Mr Shing said.He said there may be enough food for a few more days and then people would be dependent on aid to survive.Vanuatu's prime minister Joe Natuman said communication infrastructure had been badly affected and there was still no communication services across the country.""Communication providers are doing their best to install telephone links throughout the country and they have done that yesterday and today and they assured me today that they will probably install communication by this week,"" he said.The country's biggest mobile phone company Digicel said it had restored its network in the capital.While thousands await aid, Australians who were in the cyclone-struck nation made the journey home.Three flights carrying hundreds of tourists and Australians who worked in Vanuatu landed in Brisbane last night.Charlene Spiteri, who described Cyclone Pam like being at the gates of hell, thanked the Government for bringing her and others home so quickly.""I'm very proud to be Australian today because they did so well to get us out,"" she said.""I'm glad to be home with family and to let people know that we're fine.""But Ms Spiteri said she felt for those who call Vanuatu home.""It's really sad for those people,"" she said.""They are so friendly and they were worried about the tourists.""All schools in Vanuatu have been destroyed or damaged by Tropical Cyclone Pam, the United Nations said.The United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF) said it would set up safe spaces for children to continue with their basic education but said around 17,000 children under the age of five were at risk of poor health and malnutrition after the disaster.""Children unable to attend school are vulnerable. Children need psychosocial support following the cyclone and its aftermath,"" UNICEF said in a statement.UNICEF said it was also working with Vanuatu's government on water and sanitation and had begun distributing supplies to affected areas.We've had aerial surveillance... all we can tell is what we suspected, that everything's destroyed, but we don't know what's happening with the people right nowAid organisation CARE estimated 85 per cent of all houses in Port Vila were destroyed.It said the main water tanks in the capital Port Vila were empty and the city's power supply had been damaged.UNICEF said health centres, including the main hospital, had been damaged and patients had been moved to a new outpatient area.Red Cross Vanuatu chief executive Jacqueline de Gaillarde said shops were already low on supplies because people had stockpiled food before the storm but those supplies were then lost when homes were destroyed.It said its technicians would now focus on the other main population centres like the rest of Efate island, Tanna and Santo.Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office said Pam would have long-term effects on the livelihoods of the large number of local farmers, and have a major impact on the nation's food security.""Most of these people depend mainly on subsistence farming, so they lost most of their crops and some of them especially in rural areas ... might lose income,"" operations manager Peter Korisa told the ABC. ""So the priority is how they can resume back to their normal life and how they can sustain their life and maintain food security in those communities.""Authorities in Vanuatu are still struggling to establish contact with outer islands that bore the brunt of Pam's winds.The southern island of Tanna, about 200 kilometres south of Port Vila, with its 29,000 inhabitants took the full force of the storm.Initial reports from aid groups said it had been devastated, along with the main town on the southern island of Erromango, with at least two people reported dead.Aurelia Balpe, head of the Pacific office of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said it appeared Tanna had suffered widespread damage.She said a local Red Cross volunteer had been ""traumatised"" by the cyclone's intensity.""He sounded like he was in shock and we couldn't get very much information from him, just that there was devastation,"" Ms Balpe said.Save the Children's Vanuatu director Tom Skirrow said that aid agencies were preparing supplies but it would likely be three days before airfields in remote islands were cleared.""We've had aerial surveillance ... all we can tell is what we suspected, that everything's destroyed, but we don't know what's happening with the people right now,"" Mr Skirrow said.Relief flights have begun arriving in the battered Port Vila with rice, bottled water and medical kits given to more than 1500 people.But workers on the ground said there was no way to distribute desperately needed supplies across the archipelago.""Things in Port Vila are improving, people are returning to the market and getting on with the job of starting the clean-up,"" said Tom Perry, from CARE Australia.""But the key thing is we still have no contact with other provinces.

The ferry was travelling from Malekula to the capital, Port Vila, when it capsized, around 3.5 kilometres from Mangaliliu village, north of Efate island.Some hours before, its engines had apparently failed several kilometres out at sea.""[This is] a classic example for other trading vessels operating in Vanuatu, so that is a big lesson learned,"" Mr Taleo said.""And we will carry out an investigation and also we will sack the authority, especially the Ports and Harbour Authority who granted the vessel a seaworthy [certificate] to operate in the waters of Vanuatu.""Mr Taleo says the barge had no proper equipment including radio on board.He says the crew had to resort to using mobile phones to contact other ships rather than using a special radio channel to make distress calls.""A mayday distress was not conducted on board on channel 16 on radio,"" Mr Taleo said.""It only [called] the Vila central police station on a free toll line by using one of the passengers' mobile phone.""The director of Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office, Shadrach Welegtabit, says the circumstances of the accident are still unclear but he says the ferry sank several hours after the engines failed.""We sent out a rescue vessel and picked up 37 passengers plus crew,"" he said.Mangaliliu Village Chief Kalkot Mormor says his people saw the incident and alerted the authorities in Port Vila for rescue.Port Vila journalist Tony Wilson says the captain issued a distress call around 3:00am to 4:00am local time.""Police have commandeered one of the other inter-island ferries, which has gone to bring back those that have been rescued and divers are being dispatched to search for those that are still missing,"" he said.Vanuatu Police Force used the 'Big Sista' commercial ferry, which normally transports tourists and locals in the area, to rescue passengers.All the people who were rescued have been taken to Port Vila.Mr Welegtabit says the investigation is still ongoing to confirm what happened in what was a routine journey in ordinary weather conditions.""It's not really rough but we have some south-easterly winds blowing,"" he said.""Conditions are still okay for smaller boats.""We did deploy smaller boats to go and do a search and rescue, and several boats were deployed on the north part of the island.""Vanuatu is comprised of more than 80 islands, more than 60 of which are inhabited - meaning inter-island ferries are a major means of transportation across the archipelago.","Maritime Accidents and Incidents, Pacific, Vanuatu, ",2014-07-11T00:18:46+00:00

They just don't get listed because a lot of ni-Vanuatu people see drowning and water-based deaths as black magic, so they don't report them"".But Bella Anis, a mother of four from Mele village, just a few kilometres outside the capital Port Vila, says drownings are a common occurrence within the community.""There are children who have died, they've drowned because they aren't able to swim,"" Ms Anis says.Boat travel is an essential part of life in Vanuatu - where many people travel over water daily - to visit other villages, tend to gardens or go to school on neighbouring islands.But they do so at their own risk - many of the small fishing boats don't even carry lifejackets, and those that do are rarely used.Relvie Poilapa is a mother living in the capital, Port Vila. ""I think that there've been a lot of cases in the last two years where boats have capsized depending on the conditions of the water, there's a lot of people who've not been taught how to properly keep themselves afloat for long periods of time,"" Relvie Poilapa says.There is no known formal strategy to promote water nationally in Vanuatu, but now a three-month trial is offering structured swimming classes for children.American expat and certified swim instructor Nancy Miyake's behind the trial that's collaborating with the local school in Mele village and a youth centre.  They're learning how they could possibly keep themselves afloat if they're in deep water or if they were ever in a situation where they had to implement lifesaving skills.""It's the first program aimed at ni-Vanuatu. All the lessons are in Bislama, they're done with local materials, what can we get here,"" Ms Miyake explains.Children are attending classes twice a week, learning the basic strokes as well as floating techniques.Ms Miyake says it's about giving them more confidence in the water.""A lot of them don't want to go very deep or if they do go deep, they don't know how to save themselves so you see a lot of kids grabbing on to each other,"" she says.Relvie Poilapa's children are among those taking part.""They spend almost every weekend down at the beach, I think it's really fun for them, they're keeping fit, they're learning how they could possibly keep themselves afloat if they're in deep water or if they were ever in a situation where they had to implement lifesaving skills of some sort"".While the project is already running on a shoe-string budget and only has enough funding for three months, Nancy Miyake has big dreams to take it much further.""It's really small now but we're hoping it grows into not just more classes but also get enough people interested that they want to train up to become teachers or coaches or swim clubs.""""We definitely want it to become a national thing but Port Vila is the first step and then we'll go from there"".","Accidents, Family and Relationships, Pacific, Safety, Swimming, Vanuatu, ",2014-06-26T16:46:18+00:00
392,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-06-21/vanuatu-health-workers-worried-about-increasing-abortion-rat/5533848,"Birth rates across the Pacific, particularly among teenage girls, are some of the highest in the world. Vanuatu's central hospital set a record last year, with more than 3,000 deliveries; an increase of nearly 20 per cent on 2012.But local health workers are worried that at the same time the number of abortions, particularly by young girls and women, may also be increasing.That's despite abortion being illegal in Vanuatu, except for when it is needed to save a mother's life or preserve her mental health.Terminating a baby for economic or social reasons is considered to be a criminal act while it is also illegal to abort a baby that is the result of rape or incest.Arnold Bani is the Chief Executive of the Vanuatu Family Health Association (VFHA), a group that provides family planning advice.Mr Bani says women often come in to ask for an abortion - or with complications arising from having terminated their baby on their own, using 'kastom medicine'.""There might be several ways a girl will terminate a baby. For example, on an island in south Vanuatu, they use the bark of a tree to help get rid of the baby. Other islands use local leaves - each uses something different,"" Mr Bani said.There might be several ways a girl will terminate a baby.For example, on an island in south Vanuatu, they use the bark of a tree to help get rid of the baby.Other islands use local leaves - each uses something different.The only other option available is to fly to a neighbouring country like Australia where an abortion can be performed legally, however this is a costly exercise, well beyond the reach of most people in Vanuatu.Dr Tony Harry, the Head of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Port Vila Central Hospital, warns that women are putting themselves in extreme danger when they have 'backyard abortions'.""That's very dangerous to do this kind of stuff because if you end up in facilities where there's no hospital with instruments that can do evacuation in theatre or there's no hospital that has a theatre in its facilities,"" he said.""That's very dangerous because if you do that and you start bleeding, it will be very difficult.""The VFHA's Arnold Bani says there's no data available on just how many illegal abortions are taking place - and he fears that the anecdotal information is only a small indication of the full scale of the problem.""It's a really big issue. And not only are girls aborting babies but we think the rates of infanticide are really high too with girls dumping babies once they've given birth,"" he said.""So it seems that all around the country this is happening - but quietly"", Mr Bani said.The VFHA is about to launch a two-year investigation to discover how many unsafe and illegal abortions are taking place.It will include surveys in three of Vanuatu's six provinces as well as look at whether Vanuatu's current abortion policy is effective and develop recommendations for the government, based on its findings.""We need to collect data that can help the government and decision-makers look at exactly what is the situation on the ground,"" Mr Bani said.Twenty-year-old Jenny Kelep is a new mother, living in a community settlement in the outskirts of Port Vila.She gave birth to Susannah in mid-May, but there were times during her pregnancy when Jenny considered aborting her unborn child.""When I first found out I was pregnant, I thought a lot of different things - it was a mistake,"" she said.""Sometimes I thought I should just abort the baby. I was frightened.""Not only are girls aborting babies but we think the rates of infanticide are really high too with girls dumping babies once they've given birthJenny discovered she was pregnant after being pressured by her then-boyfriend to have sex without a condom.She was too scared to tell her parents as her mother had long warned her not to get pregnant until she was at least 22, when she would be mature enough to care for a child.Jenny turned to friends for help and advice. It's a familiar story to health workers like Norley Jack from the youth centre Wan Smol Bag in Port Vila. ""Almost every week we see one or two girls,"" Ms Jack said.""Maybe they are from a secondary school, they miss their period and come asking for an abortion, asking for something that might help them abort the baby.""Many of those girls include friends of Jenny Kelep. ""There are many girls, my friends including some of my best friends who are the same age as me. Some are a little older and some are even younger than me, who have aborted their babies,"" she said.""Sometimes they do it because they just want to keep enjoying their life and they're scared they won't be able to do that because they're pregnant.""Others have abortions because they're scared of telling their parents.""For some it's almost a game - and they keep having abortions every time they get pregnant.""When I first found out I was pregnant, I thought a lot of different things - it was a mistake. Sometimes I thought I should just abort the baby. I was frightened.Across the Pacific, being sexually active outside marriage is considered taboo - mainly for religious reasons - which means open and frank discussion about sex is rare.Health professionals say contraception rates are low, with less than one in three women in Vanuatu using any form of protection.""I think if you terminate a foetus or unborn child, it's the same as if you murder somebody - like an adult,"" Wan Smol Bag nurse Norley Jack said.The head of Port Vila Central Hospital's maternity ward Dr Harry says if abortion was legalised in Vanuatu, it would present an ethical dilemma for the country's medical experts.""It's much better in our conscience that we are not doing it, somebody else will be doing it,"" he said.""And that somebody else probably has to jiggle around with his conscience in terms of his Christian belief,"" Dr Harry said.New mother Jenny Kelep is grateful she kept her baby, but she believes women in Vanuatu should have a safe choice.""On the one hand, I think it would be good if abortion was made legal so it's easier and safer,"" she said.""But on the other side, if a woman doesn't want a baby, there's no need to make it!""In my case, if I'd followed my friends and had an abortion, I wouldn't have such a beautiful child in my life.""Dr Harry believes the answer to reducing the number of illegal abortions isn't simply to decriminalise the practice and make safe abortions available.Sometimes they do it because they just want to keep enjoying their life.Others have abortions because they're scared of telling their parents.For some it's almost a game - and they keep having abortions every time they get pregnant.""The best way to do is it is not to legalise abortion at the moment because a lot of organisations like the Vanuatu Christian Council or the Malvatumauri, the chief council, would be resistant in getting it legalised,"" Dr Harry said.""But I think the best way to go is to get our CPR rate, our contraception rate up, is getting contraceptive commodities available to the wider community and advocate through the education system.""""I think [a contraceptive rate of] 100 per cent would be unrealistic. Vanuatu is sitting at 28 per cent but probably we should increase it beyond 50 per cent.""There have already been significant efforts to encourage increased contraceptive use - with limited success.The United Nations Population Fund has provided free family planning products to the Vanuatu government, but Dr Harry says because of the country's limited infrastructure many products have not been distributed.""A lot of products are sitting around, not being used, and they become obsolete and they'll probably be discarded because of the expiry date,"" he said.""That's not because people aren't aware but because of the accessibility and availability in the remote areas,"" he said.","Abortion, Asia, Health, Vanuatu, ",2014-06-20T14:06:11+00:00

""This says so clearly to the world that Indonesia is not serious [about] with requests by the MSG, but the Indonesian agenda - not to allow any MSG [foreign] ministers... to visit West Papua to monitor the current situation on the ground.There are reports that more then 40 West Papuans were arrested during the MSG in Jayapura, either of people who tried to contact the MSG group or protested when the MSG delegates arrived at the airport. Mr Ondawame says this is an indication of Indonesia's ""true colours"" as a ""colonial power"".""[It will] become clear that Indonesia kills or suppresses people on the ground that want for political change,"" he said.Mr Natapei says the MSG is split over the issue of membership for the West Papua Liberation Movement, and says it's now unlikely the West Papuan separatist group will be admitted to the MSG as a full member.But the Vanuatu government's special envoy, MP Joe Natuman, says his government won't be part of it, and any agreement signed in Jakarta between other Melanesian nations and Indonesia will have to be on an individual basis rather than on behalf of the MSG.However, he says Vanuatu won't give up on its efforts to have the West Papuans admitted.""Vanuatu is still going to push...(the) agenda forward,"" he said.Mr Natuman says any agreement signed in Jakarta between other Melanesian nations and Indonesia will have to be on an individual basis rather than on behalf of the MSG.""Because I think there will be a signing, according to this program, a joint statement to be issued by the Republic of Indonesia and also the Melanesian Spearhead Group... they will be signing this statement which has nothing to do with what we've agreed,"" he said.""It has everything to do with Jakarta developing its economic ties.""Support for the plight of the West Papuan independence movement has grown in Vanuatu.Editor of the Vanuatu Independent, Tony Wilson, says Prime Minister Moana Carcasses' strong position on the issue since he came to power last March has resonated with the Ni-Vanuatu public.

""I'm really happy about that.""We wanted to have the National Council of Chiefs sign off on it and now they have, and that's fantastic and we're just ready to do the final drafting before it goes to parliament in the next month.""In the past, the current system has been marred by corruption and and allegations of nepotism.""The problems of corruption have come from the fact that the minister can approve any lease without any other conditions,"" Mr Regenvanu said.""What we're proposing now is that there's a Land Management Planning Committee established by law, which will consist of the director of the environment department, the director of the cultural centre, the physical planner of the government and the physical planner of where the land is located.""There's also the position of the independent chair of that committee, who's appointed by the judicial services commission...to make sure that committee works to the highest standard of integrity.""One of the new acts will require the custom owners to be identified before land leases are issued. ""You have to take it back down to the level of what we call the nakamal, which is the local governance institution, which is a traditional institution, and there has to be a meeting convened...so it's a very transparent process where everyone participates,"" Mr Regenvanu said.He believes the law reforms will bring fundamental change to life in Vanuatu, and people have been waiting a long time for the changes to take place.Opposition spokesman Jeff Patunvanu says the policy is ""an insult to the founders of the country's independence struggle who fought to free ni-Vanuatu custom land from the colonial yoke."".Mr Regenvanu disagrees.""We had three of the people who were drafters of the original constitution at the meetings in the last two days and they all spoke very strongly in support.""""Jeff Patunvanu was making a lot of talk before the summit, and I specifically asked him to turn up and hear what was being proposed and make his critique in the summit, and of course he was nowhere to be seen.""The Land Minister is confident the system will be fair and equitable.""There's been a lot of input into the policy behind the changes and that input comes from a wide variety of sources - we've got the constitution as our guiding principle, and then we have the 20 resolutions of the 2006 land council summit, and that land summit was also a one year process of consultation throughout the islands,"" Mr Regenvanu said.""Then you have the three reviews the government undertook of the Customary Land Tribunal Act over the last 10 years, where teams went out and asked people how...(that) act was working.""It's not perfect, and of course once we pass the laws next year we're going to have to closely monitor them and make sure things are working out as we hoped.Mr Regenvanu also believes the process of making the laws has been a watershed moment for the way public consultation around law making is conducted in Vanuatu.He's confident the changes will pass parliament.The changes also include plans to amend the constitution to ensure any future government who wants to change the land laws must first consult the National Council of Chiefs.""That change to the constitution will provide a lot more security and protection of these laws,"" Mr Regenvanu said.It will also see the removal of the juristiction of the courts to deal with issues of land ownership and resolving disputes of customary land. Instead, they'll be made at the local level. ""What that means is that once those constitutional changes are made, decisions regarding ownership of land...in customary institutions will become binding, and there'll be no power of the courts to have judicial review over those decisions, and you cannot appeal those decisions.""""So we're trying to really put back the authority of determining land ownership to the customary institutions.""","Land Management, Laws, Pacific, Vanuatu, ",2013-10-17T23:44:12+00:00

Professor Grant Schofield from the Auckland University of Technology conducted research on the food habits of several Pacific countries including Tonga, Tokelau, Kiribati and Vanuatu.  He told Pacific Beat that this trend in Vanuatu is really interesting as many are benefiting from the consumption of traditional foods due to a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrates. ""The problem is to try and stop them developing the same problems that... the Pacific has started to develop, which is as soon as you start to develop and urbanise and change your food then everything goes quite badly wrong,"" he said. ""Once you start to add... sugar, they all go badly.""Across the Pacific, diabetes prevention is high on the public health agenda.While people have heard the familiar advice of having a low fat diet, Dr Schofield himself has experimented with a low carbohydrate, high fat diet.He says he has not only lost weight but also, noticed his general wellbeing improve.""The advice that we've been giving in most developed countries is that things like coconuts are very high in saturated fat and of course everyone knows that saturated fat is bad for you,"" he said. ""But it just doesn't play out that way in these traditional food cultures.""Dr Schofield says it was back in the 1980s when the benefits of high fat traditional diets in the Pacific were recognized. The problem arises when refined and processed carbohydrates are added to the diet.Dr Schofield says a high carbohydrate diet works for the Chinese and Japanese cultures where rice is a staple in their diet.""My observation is that Pacific people don't do well on those sorts of carbohydrates,"" he said. ""The Pacific population has really been eating a good quality protein and a relatively high fat diet coming from plants for most of the time the Pacific's been around. ""Whereas (if) you go to Japanese and Chinese populations, they've been eating rice for thousands of years.""""So they're quite different. But all those countries once you start to add the third thing which is sugar, they all go badly.""Trials are now underway in the Pacific community in New Zealand where obesity and diabetes are a growing concern. ""What you see is contrary to what the regular health advice is, which is like you're too fat, you need to exercise more and eat less and you particularly need to get your fat down,"" Dr Schofield said.""We've gone for the opposite approach which is just reduce the sugar and refined and processed carbohydrates, but make sure you do get some fat and protein and those sorts of traditional foods. ""And you see quite a good deal of success.""Dr Schofield cautions that a high fat diet does not mean more fast food.""People hear high fat and... all of a sudden they're down at McDonalds or the Kentuckey Fried Chicken,"" he said. ""That particular type of diet's got a special name, that's called the Standard American diet, it's high in fat and sugar and that ends very badly as we know.""He advocates that people in the Pacific are better off following a traditional diet. ""If your grandmother or great grandmother would recognise it, eat it,"" he said. ""If they wouldn't have eaten it just forget about it. ""So as soon as you start to think about a traditional diet, don't worry about this fat and what's in the food so much, but just think about what's been around 100 years ago and that's the path to health.""","Diet and Nutrition, Food and Cooking, Health, Pacific, Tonga, Vanuatu, ",2013-10-30T23:56:47+00:00

Vanuatu Trade Development Ltd (VTD) secured the deal by promising that its global network of travel agents will soon be bringing a million tourists each year from Asia.VTD's management says the company is backed by a multi-billion dollar palm oil conglomerate and the Vanuatu Government has identified the company as Singaporean giant, Mewah. Mewah has denied links to the company, its directors or the Vanuatu development.""We confirm that the Company mentioned [Vanuatu Trade Development Ltd] is not a Mewah Group company.  The Group has no involvement in the project, and is not underwriting the project,"" said Tan Kim Tew, from Mewah Corporate Services Department.The Vanuatu Government is pushing ahead with the concession, but the Opposition is preparing a Supreme Court challenge. ""This project will bring Vanuatu down to its knees and it's likely to become another failed state,"" said Willie Jimmy, Opposition member and former finance minister.Tourism is a crucial part of Vanuatu's economy.Currently, a third of Vanuatu's workforce is employed in the tourism sector and 40 per cent of the nation's GDP is driven by international visitors. For decades Vanuatu's leaders have dreamed of a new airport that could accommodate wider-bodied, long-haul planes flying in tourists straight from Asia. In late July that dream came a step closer to reality, when the government signed a deal with a Singapore-based company to build a new international airport and upgrade several regional airports.The deal was signed by Vanuatu's Prime Minister Moana Carcasses Kalosil and VTD's general manager Eric Ong and director David Mak.As part of the deal, the Vanuatu Government will issue four separate promissory notes guaranteeing the repayment of $350 million if the government, or any future government, breaches the agreement. During the course of the 50 year concession, VTD will operate the airports to recoup the money spent on construction and to earn profits.  Aviation experts say the plan could work in theory, provided the company can bring in a lot more tourists. As well as the alleged global network of travel agents, a leaked government document says VTD has an ""implicit agreement"" with an unnamed airline that will help bring a tenfold increase in annual tourist arrivals.VTD representatives have not responded to the ABC's repeated attempts to contact them for comment, but they have spoken to local media in Vanuatu.""VTD is part of a group of companies, very diversified,""Eric Ong told Marc O'Brien on Buzz 96FM.""The core business of our group is in edible oils and then we are also into printing, we are into travel, we have our insurance companies, we have tobacco companies, we own plantations, we own oil palm plantations.""We have an annual turnover of $4 billion in 2011 and...even if we were to fund it by the group ourselves, we are able to fund this $350 million project.""In an August press release, the Vanuatu Government linked VTD with Mewah.This project will bring Vanuatu down to its knees and it's likely to become another failed state.""The VTDL is a Singapore-based company established specifically for this purpose and is part of the Mewah group of companies listed on the Singapore stock exchange,"" the Office of Vanuatu's Prime Minister said in the statement. But Mewah Corporate Services Department has told the ABC it has no involvement with the company, and that Mewah is not underwriting the project.It says Mewah has no link to VTD's executives Eric Ong and David Mak.The denial raises more questions for the Opposition. ""Who is behind this? What is the track record of VTDL of any project of such magnitude that VTDL has undertaken in any part of the world or Asia or Pacific?"" Opposition MP Willie Jimmy said.The Vanuatu Trade Development company was formed out of the ashes of a failed tobacco investment. David Mak and Eric Ong tried to start a tobacco plantation business using another company, Rock International. When the Vanuatu Government last year refused to allow Rock International to import tobacco seeds and promote smoking, they changed direction. One of the directors of Rock International was Cheo Tiong Choon, who is the sole shareholder of Vanuatu Trade Development Ltd. Cheo Tiong Choon is a substantial shareholder of Mewah, but the company says Mr Cheo is not acting on behalf of the palm oil giant. ""We confirm that Mewah Group neither has any direct or indirect involvement in the project nor it has authorised anyone to act on its behalf for the project,"" said Mewah's Tan Kim Tew.When Vanuatu Trade Development registered last year in Singapore it was as a ""wholesale trader"" with paid up capital of $400,000. There was no mention of travel agents, construction or aviation, despite the Vanuatu Government saying VTD was set up specifically for the airport development.The size of the investment - $350 million is a quarter of Vanuatu's annual GDP - makes the credibility of VTD an important matter for Vanuatu's Government. The Opposition says the tiny Pacific nation simply couldn't afford to pay back the money if the government was to breach the concession agreement. ""All the economic productivity of this country just cannot sustain the recovery of this amount at any one time,"" Opposition MP Willie Jimmy said.The Vanuatu Government has investigated the background of Vanuatu Trade Development. In April, the Council of Ministers directed its 20-member Airport Taskforce go on a ""fact finding mission to Singapore to conduct further due diligence on the company, its directors, its shareholders and related companies and to ascertain their capacity to carry out the project as anticipated."" A second legal opinion was sought from Australian lawyer John Mulally in July.The Vanuatu Government, Vanuatu Trade Development Ltd, Rock International Marketing and John Mulally all declined to comment or did not respond to the ABC's inquiries. ""It is a very sensitive and controversial issue as well concerning the sovereignty of this nation,"" said Letty Williams Kaltonga, from Vanuatu's Prime Minister's Office.  ""This is a sovereign domestic issue. Unfortunately we will not respond to your questions due to the matter is before the Vanuatu Parliament.""When the ABC tried to contact VTD director David Mak at his Singapore office, staff said he is now acting as the honorary consul for Vanuatu in Singapore, and gave the ABC an email address reflecting this. If David Mak is the honorary consul for Vanuatu in Singapore, it could give rise to a conflict of interest in securing a multi-million dollar contract from the Government. Numerous international aviation experts contacted by the ABC said they had never heard of VTD before the Vanuatu deal.However, VTD has linked up with Australian-based consultant, Leading Edge Aviation Planning Professionals, known as LEAPP. ""I think they'll be depending mostly on the consultants LEAPP and LEAPP have done quite a lot of work around the world,"" said Kevin Abel, General Manager of Airports Vanuatu. LEAPP did not respond to attempts to get comment on this issue. Some basic elements of the airport deal remain murky.When Kevin Abel met representatives of VTD last month, he asked where the new international airport might be located.""It was kept top secret.

An Australian South Sea Islander, Colin Terare, says events such as the re-enactment are an important way to remind Australians of their history.""The majority of Australians I don't think are aware that there was slavery here,"" Mr Terare said.""My great grandfather was not asked politely. He was stolen.""I've actually been to the very spot where he's been stolen from.""Clive Moore, professor of Pacific and Australian History at the University of Queensland, says that while some indentured workers came willingly, others were blackbirded. ""Historians would say that probably 10 to 15 per cent would fit into the category of being totally illegally brought to Australia,"" he said. ""But there's undoubtedly coercion, kidnapping (and) violence involved, the percentage of it you can debate.""Professor Moore says that some 30 per cent of those brought to Australia later died because they lacked immunity to many of the diseases common to the European community, while those that survived were treated as second-class citizens.""There was no other immigrant group brought to Australia that was partially kidnapped, that died in such large numbers, and then was treated in a racially inferior way,"" he said.Professor Moore points to recent evidence he has found that shows the Queensland and Commonwealth governments owe the families of blackbirded Pacific islanders close to $38 million, mostly from deceased estates.Descendants believe that morally and politically the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth has to make some restitution for stolen wages of deceased islanders, and many of the 40,000 South Sea Islanders living in Australia are also pushing for a formal apology for their ancestors' treatment.My great grandfather was not asked politely. He was stolen. Vanuatu's prime minister, Moana Carcasses Kalosil, has also called for an apology but stopped short of calling for compensation.The Vanuatu lands minister, Ralph Regenvanu, says compensation is unnecessary, but they are pushing for the Australian Government to make it easier for its citizens to once again work in Australia under the Pacific Workers Scheme.""We're not talking about compensation, we're talking about allowing people to work in Australia and right a wrong from history,"" he said. ""It would be away to reconnect families that have been broken, it would facilitate a cultural exchange. ""And at the same time, it would help bridge a gap of disadvantage in terms of Vanuatu's development.""In Vanuatu, the 150th anniversary has sparked interest especially among young people, many of whom are only now discovering what their forbears endured.Critics blame their lack of knowledge on a failure to prioritise the event in the national school curriculum.But the Vanuatu Government is now putting the dark chapter of the country's history back on the education agenda.We're not talking about compensation. We're talking about allowing people to work in Australia, and right a wrong from history.Charley Robert, Vanuatu's principal education officer, says they are currently undertaking a massive overhaul of the national school curriculum which, more than 30 years after gaining independence, is still heavily influenced by its former colonial masters England and France.""The curriculum reform is now entirely home grown,"" he said.""All of the concepts and all of philosophies, for any of subjects, must originate from our country.""It's a way of respecting our principals, our sovereignty and our independence.""The new syllabus is still in its draft stage, but there are high hopes it can start being rolled out in 2015.Local history will play an important part, but so too will the Creole language, Bislama, which came about as a result of the blackbirding trade.""The white men were speaking English but our ancestors, especially those working on the farms, couldn't understand it,"" Chief David Fadanumata from the Vanuatu Indigenous Descendents Association explained.It then spread throughout the Pacific as islanders were forcibly deported under Australia's White Policy in the early 20th Century.Despite being one of Vanuatu's three official languages, Bislama has been banned from the country's classrooms. But in a major policy shift, and a pointed acknowledgement of its significance in the country's make-up today, Vanuatu now wants schools promoting the language, especially in special 'custom classes'.""It would be introduced in the context that's suitable for the activity,"" Mr Robert said.""Like carving the canoe... or weaving the mat or a bag, (that) will be conducted in mother tongue.""","Australia, Community and Society, History, History Education, Pacific, Reconciliation (Apology), Vanuatu, ",2013-08-14T11:46:19+00:00

A number returned,"" he said.He says a number of historical legacies, established by returned blackbirded people, continue to be maintained today.Mr Reganvanu also says the Prime Minister discussed the opportunities the commemoration is providing for Vanuatu now ""in terms of re-linking and finding a way forward on the issue"".The increasing number of South Sea Islanders going to Vanuatu to rediscover their connections is creating a new dynamic in the relationship between Port Vila and Canberra.Mr Reganvanu says he hopes it will lead to a stronger relationship, including the growth of Australia's modern-day seasonal worker scheme, which offers very different conditions.","Australia, Farm Labour, Foreign Affairs, History, Pacific, Vanuatu, ",2013-07-31T14:41:15+00:00

He denies the allegation.Mr Carcasses is also facing claims he voted at a different polling station to the Port Vila Municipality Town Hall where he was listed. Vanuatu's electoral system allows a petitioner to approach the Supreme Court after the election to claim bribery has been committed by the successful candidate.

The then Prime Minister, Sato Kilman, resigned knowing he would lose a Vote of No Confidence.Mr Carcasses has spelled out a 68-point plan for his first 100 days in office, and says in a country which often faces political instability, he has the support to see it through.""I have the support of the main two parties, which is the Vanua'aku Party and UMP,"" he said. ""They decided to support me not on a racial level, I think on the quality of leadership, someone who can bring everyone together.""One of the first acts of the new prime minister was to haul his cabinet ministers, senior officials and even the diplomatic corps out of the capital, Port Vila, to a part of the country they don't often visit: the northernmost province of Vanuatu, which borders Solomon Islands. It's the first time that's been done and they held meetings with community leaders. But Moana Carcasses Kalosil is used to breaking the mould - Vanuatu's first non-indigenous Prime Minister, he was born in Tahiti and his parents moved to Vanuatu in 1965 when it was still a colony jointly administered by France and Great Britain.""I went to school here, and I remember my father was sick,"" he said. ""At the age of 14 I had to stop school and look after the plantation. ""So I'm a self taught man with lots of experience whether it's to build a road, whether it's to build a house, whether it is to manage a company.""The Opposition Leader, Ham Lini, is critical of the cost of taking the whole Cabinet and senior bureaucrats to the provinces. He questions whether it provided real benefits for the people there or if it was just a stunt.""The interesting thing is to see after what benefits has done this, has this done to the provinces or the people in the grassroots because all the money that will be spending on this meetings and then no money to go for services,"" he said.Prime Minister Carcasses invited to Sola, the capaital of the Toba Province, some of those who do have access to funds - the heads of diplomatic missions who provide aid to Vanuatu. The donors were presented with a list of projects in need of funding, and a Church youth group closed off the meeting with a song saying their province was poor but the donors could solve all their problems.One notable absence was the Chinese Ambassador, the latest apparent snub in the wake of Mr Carcasses decision to ask a Chinese construction company to relocate a convention centre planned for the capital.""This is the request of the supporters of the town,"" he said. ""They say, 'We don't have much of what you call green space. The only green space that is available that we can have is the one in Parliament.' ""So the majority of the citizens of Port Vila are asking us, 'What are you doing in government? We don't want a Convention Centre here!'.""What we want and I am sure the Government of China will want that investment, their investment will satisfy the people first - not political leaders or someone else like this.The Opposition Leader, Ham Lini, says the sudden cancellation will spoil Vanuatu's relations with China.""They have done everything and have signed with the government and were ready to start the job, but then this government comes in and says they have to relocate that,"" he said. ""What that means is to cancel the whole thing - not only that, but also it will ruin the relationship between Vanuatu and the Chinese Governments.""Another project that has been cancelled is a Defence Cooperation Agreement with Indonesia, under which Indonesia was supplying uniforms and other assistance to the Vanuatu police. Mr Carcasses has long been a supporter of the Melanesian people of West Papua who want independence from Indonesia are claim they are being oppressed.""I remember calling the then commissioner of police,"" he said.""[I said] to them, 'You are signing an agreement with the people who are killing the West Papuans. You going to sleep at night?'.""The West Papuan Council for Liberation has an office in Vanuatu and its Vice President, Dr Otto Ondawame, is delighted.""Melanesia is not for Indonesia - it's for Melanesia and therefore the Government of Vanuatu made it clear his position that Melanesia is only for Melanesia,"" he said.""Indonesia is not allowed to come here in whatever form.""Mr Carcasses is supporting the West Papuans' application to become full members of the Melanesian Spearhead Group of countries when their leaders meet in New Caledonia next month. He says that ten years ago as foreign minister he tried to set up a peace conference in Vanuatu between the Indonesian Government and the West Papua freedom movement.""We should have the government of Indonesia and the people of West Papua discussing their issues,"" he said.

His government is revoking the diplomatic passports that the previous government had given to a string of roving ambassadors. One of these was the roving Ambassador to Russia who had struck a deal to keep fifteen percent of whatever aid money she could attract.

""That makes it right up the top of where we expect to see worldwide in terms of cervical cancer prevalence.""He says there are no statistics explaining why rates of death from cervical cancer are so high in Vanuatu while rates of HPV infection are comparable to other countries.However, he says countries with pap smear screening programs can catch the infection and treat it before it develops into cancer.""In Vanuatu it's not been possible to mount a systematic screening program,"" he said.""Although we have been helping out with the development of a screening program which the Vanuatu government itself has instigated.""Professor Frazer says one of the problems faced trying to setting up a HPV screening program in Vanuatu is a lack of resources.""It's a matter of technology,"" he said.""To run a screening program you need a lot of support from pathology services, a means of keeping records across the whole country...and then you have to have the ability to treat abnormal smears.""Professor Frazer says there is now a much easier way of screening for cervical cancers and his team is in the process of finding funding.","Australia, Cervical and Vulval Cancers, Diseases and Disorders, Health, Pacific, Vaccines and Immunity, Vanuatu, ",2013-05-30T01:47:37+00:00

Vanuatu Investment Promotion Authority's Chief Executive, Smith Tebu, told Radio Australia's Pacific Beat that very strict Health Department regulations forced the government to withhold approval for the project.""This company was not the only company that has applied for investment in the tobacco processing,"" Mr Tebu said.""There were a number of companies who have applied in the past for this same activity and they were all rejected based on the same reason.""Vanuatu passed the Tobacco Control Act in 2009, which bans all forms of advertising of tobacco, the sale of tobacco or cigarettes to children and adolescents, and bans smoking in hospitals and schools.But health advocates are worried that tobacco manufacturers may target other Pacific countries as cheap sources of labour and a market for cheap cigarettes.New Zealand Heart Foundation's Manager for Pacific Health, Louisa Ryan, says a lack of tobacco regulation in the Pacific has attracted tobacco companies.""If you mirror countries like Australia and New Zealand where we were able to control some of the flow of the tobacco in and some of the use and how its sold, they don't have such laws in the Pacific islands,"" Ms Ryan said.""We're always very concerned when we hear that the tobacco companies are going in there not just to continue to sell but they're producing the tobacco on-site.""She says the market in the Pacific is getting younger and younger, with some children beginning to smoke at age 8 or 9.Ms Ryan says smoking also exacerbates other problem diseases in the Pacific, such as cardiovascular disease, lung cancer and diabetes.

""Women and girls are up to 14 times more likely to die during a disaster and that's often purely the result of inadequate access to education and awareness messages,"" he said.""It's very important to try and change that.""","Disaster Relief, Pacific, Tsunamis, Vanuatu, Volcanic Eruptions, ",2012-10-11T11:55:35+00:00

The suspension of the senior executives of the National Provident Fund came after a series of damaging articles published in Vanuatu's Daily Post newspaper accusing them of nepotism and mismanagement.The government says it will hold an independent inquiry into the claims.The articles alleged the general manager of the fund had paid herself a substantial monthly salary while also recruiting family members before more experienced candidates, and also paying them higher than normal salaries. Director General of Vanuatu's finance department, George Mamiuri, has told Radio Australia's Pacific Beat program the suspension with pay was a necessary measure.""In the past, when the board suspended management without pay, they brought the case against the fund and was successful in court,"" he said. ""The fund was obliged to pay all the salaries as well as the expenses occurred during the court process.""The National Provident Fund has been the subject of controversy before. Similar allegations in 1998 led to rioting and unrest in the Pacific nation.General secretary of the Vanuatu Christian Council, Shem Tamar, also speaking to Pacific Beat, says the suspensions may have prevented rioting this time around, but there is still anger among people who feel there will be nothing to claim by the time they retire.

George Mamiuri says the government has a plan of action to restore confidence in the pension fund, saying it was only for a short period of time in ten years that executive salaries had increased to a level that was seen as unacceptable. ""The investigation will cover areas in relation to areas of recruitment processing, salary grading, and looking at the members' benefits,"" he said.""And also the tender and procurement processes.""Mr Mamiuri did not specify when the investigation would begin but he did say it would take at least one month.

The new fibre optic cable will run across 1200 kilometres of seafloor between Port Vila and Suva, in Fiji, where it will meet up with the main trans-Pacific cables, linking Australia and New Zealand with North America.Simon Fletcher says the resulting faster, cheaper internet will open new opportunities for individuals, as well as businesses in Vanuatu.""Telecommunications enhancements in bandwidth supply could offer products such as remote monitoring and diagnosis of medical conditions, MRI scans for example,"" he said.  "" There could be a doctor in Australia viewing a live MRI scan in Port Vila, providing the technology is enabled to provide that. Also we may see in education, much more access to live education offerings in other jurisdictions, online degrees and lectures that require a far greater access to bandwidth than is currently being provided in Vanuatu.""Mr Fletcher is hoping to reduce the risk of outages on the fibre optic cable by building a loop link which could bring in Solomon Islands or New Caledonia.""Obviously, the first cable is the most important cable at this point in time but we see our growth opportunities in connecting to New Caledonia, via Lifou, or potentially connecting to the Solomon Islands, which has designs on connecting to the pipe cable network that runs down to Australia,"" he said. ""So the second cable will provide a level of redundancy and give a great deal more comfort to those that are looking to invest in Vanuatu ICT,"" said Mr Fletcher.  ""In the case of the unlikely event that one of our cables was to fail, we have another opportunity or routing path for those businesses to use so there is not disruption to their services.""

She had to be obliterated. It seems the police agreed. No charges were laid.In some parts of the world, not only do fathers, brothers and husbands own a woman's body, they own her virtue. Their identity and manliness is embedded in it.This, of course, is an impossible burden for any woman to carry.Afghan teenager Aishia learned that last year, when she was pinned down as her husband cut off her nose and ears, because she tried to escape his family's abuse. Seventeen-year-old Dua Khalil learned it too, just before she was stoned to death in northern Iraq three years ago, for having a boyfriend. Bangladeshi woman Fozilitun Nessa also learned it, when her face was doused in acid because she refused a marriage proposal.For the hundreds of thousands of women killed, maimed, or savagely beaten for expressing their free will, ""honour"" doesn't come into it. Nor does a fair trial. As Iranian mother Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani knows too well. She's on death row, facing execution by stoning for having sex with a man who wasn't her husband.There is a totalising ideology on the march across the world, and it's anti-women. This is not about religion, piety or virtue. Rather it's about misogyny and a global war against women. It's about the rights and freedoms of women. The ownership and control over women's bodies has become the chief battleground.World events and the rise of neo-fundamentalism in the 80s and 90s, by young men eager to revive and restore old practices, have made feminism more important than ever. And yet feminism has lost its voice.We don't know how to respond to the horrors of infallible patriarchal control. In our failure to act and strenuously resist this global push back against women's liberty and free agency, feminism is at a point of moral crisis.Has feminism failed? Numbers have improved, legal structures and new frameworks have been erected. The scaffolding is there - for some of us. But for a growing number of the world's women, their freedoms are at serious risk. And feminism remains deathly silent.Right now, at a time when we need a massive feminist surge to fight back rising anti-woman sentiment, we're sitting on our hands. Is this not our business too? Why do feminist responsibilities stop at the border?Somali born feminist, Aayan Hirsi Ali, speaks of the West's ""misguided politeness"" in opting to say nothing and do nothing about the abhorrent abuses and treatment of women and girls, that are excused as cultural custom or religious rites.Honour killings, female genital mutilation, acid attacks, forced marriages, and sexual slavery are among the so-called 'cultural' practices she has in mind when Hirsi Ali calls on Western feminists to ""take on the plight of Muslim women and make it their own cause"".However, indignity, debasement and gender apartheid extend beyond fundamentalism. Ignorance is perhaps the greatest tool of control used against women. There are 62 million primary school age girls around the world who don't go to school. Some 520 million women can't read.More than half a million women die each year - around one per minute - from treatable reproductive complications, and a lack of priority.It is inconceivable to me that someone can pick up a newborn baby girl and in disgust throw it into a ""slops pail"", uttering the words ""useless thing"". Chinese writer Xinran Xue described this scene recently when writing about ""Gendercide"" and the world's missing 100 million baby girls. At least being chucked in the bin is a quick death. Other baby girls are slowly starved, or simply abandoned, for one single reason - they are female.What is it about girls and women that make them so utterly dispensable?In our own backyard, the Pacific region, some of the rates of maternal death are among the worst in the world. Papua New Guinea is only surpassed by Afghanistan and yet this scandal of female neglect rates no mention here. Picture Fiji, Vanuatu, or the Solomn Islands, and we think of holidays. What we choose not to see are skyrocketing teenage pregnancies and extremely high rates of violence against women. Sixty per cent of Pacific nations have no laws against domestic violence. Which is perhaps why 73 per cent of women in the Solomons think it's OK for a husband to beat his wife. Last year Vanuatu's traditional chiefs challenged a 2008 law passed to protect women form domestic violence, saying it ""contradicted Vanuatu's custom"".Traditional, cultural practices that assert male authority will always disadvantage women. So why do we kow-tow to them? Why are we so ready to adopt a lazy, cultural-relativist position?Has feminism failed? Perhaps not for you and I.

He pocketed more than $180,000 through the scheme.Now he has two years' jail to look forward to, after being sentenced last Friday by the New South Wales District Court in Australia.It was another success for Project Wickenby, which started in 2006 and combines the efforts of several Australian agencies to crack down on offshore tax fraud.Michael O'Neill, senior assistant commissioner for Project Wickenby at the Australian Tax Office, says a common scheme is to create false deductions to allow businesses to understate their income.""Then that money is washed through a series of secrecy havens and then sometimes brought back to Australia in a way that tries to hide it from the tax office or other authorities,"" he said.Under Wickenby, 57 people have been charged with criminal offences and 11 so far convicted and sent to jail. The operation has raised more than $850 million and more people than ever are coming forward to declare offshore income.Several Pacific Island nations have long had the dubious image of being tax havens, with low taxes and few questions asked on the creation of false companies.Cooperation with regional governments is one of Wickenby's goals.Mr O'Neill says ""exchange agreements"" are being sought ""so that information can flow more easily between Australia and countries that we previously thought were secrecy havens.""""That sort of transparency makes it difficult for people to hide their assets or hide their income,"" he said.The Vanuatu government changed its laws several years ago to increase legal oversight and transparency. That led many banks managing offshore accounts to close.But in spite of the changes, some in Vanuatu still feel they are unfairly tainted with a poor reputation.Marie Noelle Ferrieux-Patterson, who heads corruption watchdog Transparency International in Vanuatu, says some people tell small islands to match international standards of transparency.""[But] we all know that in the United States, you have got at least two states that [have] more secrecy than Vanuatu does for the creation of companies,"" she said.Shocked by the Global Financial Crisis, 83 international jurisdictions have signed up to tighten international tax standards overseen by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (oeCD).Six Pacific countries have also committed to the standards, however all but one are on the bottom list of nations that still have not taken any real steps.Vanuatu is on that list, and is scheduled to be reviewed under an oeCD peer review system next year.Ms Ferrieux-Patterson says Vanuatu has already done a lot, and it is easy to check money flows that involve the island.""It's easy to check, because we have international banks,"" she said.""They are linked to Australia and most of them, the head company is in Australia, so they have to fulfil both the standards of Vanuatu and also of Australia.""","Australia, Business, Economics and Finance, Corporate Crimes, Government and Politics, Law, Crime and Justice, Tax, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2010-07-07T13:34:00+00:00

The growers looked elsewhere for workers and of the 100 visas made available for Pacific workers, just 56 were filled.It was hoped that many of those delays could be avoided this year to allow more growers, and Pacific Islanders, to take advantage of the 2,400 visas now available as part of phase two of the pilot.But Paul Kiley, the resources manager with All Recruiting Services - one of the three Government-approved labour hire companies - has told Radio Australia so far that has not been the case, despite negotiations with growers.""We've been looking since August-September and would have liked to have workers in the fields now, but none of the workers have agreed to our rates,"" he said.The cost of hiring a Pacific Islander is one of the reasons growers say they have been reluctant to take part in the pilot.As the employer, they are required to pay half the return airfare - about $800 - plus an additional $100 in transport costs.Once the Pacific Island workers are in the field, they cost $1 more an hour than the legal rate for local workers to cover the cost of administration.The additional cost seemed more reasonable two years ago when growers were facing a serious labour shortage.But that situation has now changed.Kris Newton, the chief executive of the Horticulture Australia Council, says there has been a decrease in demand for labour, mainly because of the global financial crisis, and there are more travellers keen for work in Australia.""So demand has remained high but supply is also high and is quite reliable. We were certainly thinking when the 800 initial visas were announced that it wasn't enough. In retrospect it was probably about right and we'll struggle to fill that this year,"" he said.Mr Kiley says there is more to the fall-off in demand for Pacific Islanders than the global recession or even this year's drought.""There are people on working holiday visas that are working more than holidaying, there are people on student visas working 40 hours and there are people on visitors visas working who shouldn't be and those people get paid well and truly below the awarded rate of pay,"" Mr Kiley said.The Australian Government has been holding regular meetings with labour hire firms, and says it is committed to getting the pilot off the ground.A spokeswoman from the Australian Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations confirmed that they have just issued a fresh request for expressions of interest for growers.Meanwhile, the three Pacific countries signed up to participate in the pilot say they have not yet been approached for workers this year.Vanuatu's Labour Commissioner, Lionel Kaluat, says it is unfortunate but says they were aware of the terms of the scheme.""It's disappointing but... it's a market driven scheme,"" he said.","Agribusiness, Agricultural Crops, Australia, Kiribati, Rural, Tonga, Vanuatu, ",2009-11-26T07:21:00+00:00

But it is not clear how the tribe will deal with his inevitable mortality.Asia Pacific Focus visited Tanna and found a remarkable spread of religious diversity.Lava explosions, which reach many storeys above the bubbling cauldron of the central crater, can be heard, like occasional rolling thunder, across the island's south-east.On Friday evenings, as the sun sets behind Yasur's rumbling slopes, songs can be heard in the surrounding villages.In another of the intriguing belief systems of the island, the people surrounding the volcano do not venerate Prince Philip, instead raising their voices in praise to another spirit figure, John Frum.Frum is said to have visited here in the 1930s, as either a man or a spirit, depending on who you talk to.He advised the people here to reject cannibalism, but to maintain every other aspect of their traditional culture - to the extent of opposing missionaries.And he said that, one day, America would come to help the islanders.It was a prediction which became a prophecy fulfilled when soldiers arrived in World War II, with free medical attention and infrastructure.Now war souvenirs, and flags of all sorts, are believed to act as protection for the traditional culture.It was another case of interaction that resulted in the Duke of Edinburgh being elevated to godlike status by the people of Yakel.Unlike the John Frumers, who wear largely western clothing, the women of this group wear grass skirts, and the men, penis sheaths.Deep in Tanna's rainforest they live a subsistence lifestyle, and reject modern things like money.And they have an ancient legend which tells of a group of warriors who left, a long time a go, to fight a war on a faraway island so as to preserve Tannese culture.The leader of the warriors said he would return one day with a rich and powerful wife.In 1974 the British Royal family paid a visit to the then New Hebridies.While in the capital, Port Vila, Prince Philip is said to have handed a man from Tanna a symbolic white pig, and in doing so, stumbled into the ancient prophecy.Local man Thom Sia, who acts as English translator for the village elders, said his people were waiting patiently for Prince Philip's return.The elders of the tribe have a collection of sometimes old and torn photographs of the Duke of Edinburgh.They want him to live in their village.""We love for Prince Philip to go to England and stay for long time, and we love for him to come back and see us in Tanna,"" the translator said.When questioned about what will happen if the Prince dies, Mr Sia, after consulting an older man in group calmly replied the tribe believed the royal consort would be returning to Tanna to die.""We don't think Prince Philip will die in England, we are loving him to coming back to die.""Prince Philip's family may have different ideas for what to do in such a situation.But whatever happens, anthropologists say the Duke of Edinburgh will enjoy a type of immortality - forever venerated here by a culture which has already lasted thousands of years.Australian Museum anthropologist Kirk Huffman, who has studied the people of Vanuatu for about 30 years, says the beliefs of the region have often been incorrectly branded as cargo cults.Cargo cults are belief systems focused around material goods, which sometimes occur when traditional societies come into contact with industrialised cultures.The cults centre on obtaining technological development and material wealth through spiritual means.""I think it is rather unfortunate that the white people analysing aspects of some of these movements have tended to call them cargo cults,"" Dr Huffman said in an interview for Asia Pacific Focus.""The white people have tended to concentrate on the materialistic side of some of these belief system without realising that there are much more profound questions being asked.""These types of movements are actually visionary movements and they are ways that societies in many places in the western Pacific have tried to come to terms with new realities in a way that will help them to explain these new realities.""","Community and Society, Human Interest, Offbeat, Religion and Beliefs, Royalty, United Kingdom, Vanuatu, ",2009-04-26T08:34:00+00:00

The rural areas where the majority of people don't have access to newspapers, televisions and, in the last few years, radio because there's been a problem with the transmitter.

By 2007 it had increased to $US293 million.According to the Lowy research, the interest and increase has nothing to do with Chinese military expansion, as has often been hypothesised. Fergus Hanson says the only battle in China's funding is a diplomatic one.""Chinese aid money is only going to the countries that recognise China exclusively,"" he said.Within a day of the release of this report China hit back, rejecting its findings as ""pointless"", and saying its aid was given without ulterior motive.But the People's Republic of China, or Mainland China and The Republic of China or Taiwan, have spent years fighting for diplomatic allegiance from other nations. In the Pacific, Taiwan is recognised by six nations, and China by eight.Taiwan's aid program does not feature in this report, but it has already been the focus of plenty of study. One often-quoted example is the 2001 $US25 million loan from Taiwan to Solomon Islands, intended as compensation to the victims of ethnic violence.Most of that money ended up in the pockets of corrupt politicians, police, and militia leaders. This new report has found China's aid does just as little to promote good governance.In essence, China and Taiwan have a ""No Questions Asked"" policy on aid. And the actions of both is seen as an unsettling influence of the region, and the stated aim of countries like Australia and New Zealand, to use aid to promote good governance.For their part, Pacific Island nation leaders seem happy to accept the aid, and align themselves one way or another. But that friendship rarely filters down to the people on the street.The Chinese have a presence through business and migration in most Pacific Island nations, but that presence is resented by many Pacific Islanders.In the case of China, the ill feeling is not helped by the way it provides aid.Most money goes to infrastructure projects, which have to be built using Chinese companies, labour and materials. There are now plenty of new sporting complexes, colleges, conference centres and government offices across the region.There is also plenty of animosity from islanders, already unemployed and living in poverty, who feel they got nothing out of the building project.The insistence its money be spent on its own companies, workers and materials, has also led to an influx of Chinese-influenced architecture.If you visit the Vanuatu Agricultural College on the island of Santo, you find a complex which would look at home on the outskirts of Beijing.In this new report, Mr Hanson has recommended China co-ordinate its aid effort with countries like Australia, to ensure money goes to the most needed areas.""China can't go into donor meetings and say, 'We're giving x-amount of dollars in official development assistance, aimed at primarily promoting the development of Pacific Islander countries,' because its program at the moment is shrouded in secrecy,"" he said.It would also remove some of the bargaining power from Pacific leaders, who are skilled at playing aid donors against another.But the choice might be out of their hands. Last week negotiators from China and Taiwan met in Beijing for the first time in nine years to look at ways to improve their relationship.Diplomatic issues were not on the agenda, but Taiwan's new President Ma Ying Jaou has said he wants an end to the diplomatic war, and the drain it is placing on his country's coffers.If Taiwan is no longer prepared to fight, it would seem unlikely China would maintain its high-spending ways out of a sense of good will.Based on a report by Campbell Cooney for Correspondent's Report.","Business, Economics and Finance, China, Fiji, International Aid and Trade, Pacific, Taiwan, Vanuatu, World Politics, ",2008-06-22T02:00:00+00:00

Smelling just like coconut biscuits straight out of the oven, the exhaust is a big improvement on an old diesel engine belching acrid black smoke.""It smells sweet. You can put your nose right up to the exhaust,"" Witon Barry said, assistant manager of the Tobolar Copra processing plant in the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro.All over the Pacific power authorities, private companies and entrepreneurs have been experimenting with coconut oil as an alternative to diesel fuel for vehicles, power generators and even ships.""The idea goes right the way back to Mr Rudolf Diesel. He invented the combustion engine to use peanut oil,"" Jerry Kramer said, chief executive of Pacific International, a company pioneering the use of coconut oil in the Marshall Islands.The use of coconut oil received a boost in the past couple of years as oil prices hit record heights and coconut oil fell to around $US550 ($655) a tonne in the volatile world commodity markets.Coconut trees are found everywhere in the Pacific's tropical islands. The dried white flesh, known as copra, from six to 10 coconuts produces a litre of oil, making the substitution for expensive diesel seem a no-brainer.But ironically the growth in the use of biofuels worldwide has helped push the price of crop oils higher and coconut oil now fetches nearly $1,190 a tonne.""There is strong demand for vegetable oils, there is a huge demand in the US and Europe,"" said Jan Cloin, the energy adviser at SOPAC, the Secretariat of the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission based in Suva.""The Pacific island countries could get into a situation where they cannot afford to use the oil themselves and would profit more by sending their oil to other countries.""Mr Kramer's company exports most of the oil from the Tolobar mill it operates for the Marshall Islands government and its coconut oil fuel projects have recently taken a back seat.""At the peak we used 100 per cent coconut oil in ships with 1,000 horsepower engines and all the way down to five horsepower generators,"" he said.But he remains committed to the idea, especially using coconut oil to generate electricity in remote islands, where diesel is particularly expensive.Coconut oil was used as a substitute for diesel in the Philippines during World War II when diesel was scarce, but it is only in recent years the idea has taken off.The rising cost of oil, worries that oil will run out and increasing concerns about the environmental impact of fossil fuels have all boosted attempts to find alternative energy sources.In the Marshall Islands, Mr Kramer has been experimenting for several years with trying pure coconut oil in some of his vehicles, as well as heavy machinery and even tug boats and a cargo ship.Some modern diesel engines are less tolerant of pure coconut oil. Another problem is that coconut oil starts to solidify below 25 degrees Celsius - but that is not a problem on many tropical islands.Mr Kramer found carefully filtered coconut oil with excess moisture removed worked perfectly in many diesel engines.""With some of our trucks we run, we've been running on coconut oil for years and we haven't had a problem after four or five years,"" he said.But he says for many engines, a blend with diesel works best.""We did blends anywhere from 10 per cent to 90 per cent (with diesel) and we found the most tolerance for all types of engines was a 50-50 blend,"" Mr Kramer said.Australian-born entrepreneur Tony Deamer has also been experimenting in Vanuatu, running some vehicles from his own hire car and car dealership on pure coconut oil.He has also sold a blend of 80 per cent coconut oil and 20 per cent kerosene as a diesel alternative under the Island Fuel brand.Island Fuel has been on hold recently due to some equipment problems but Mr Deamer says it will be up and running again soon.Experiments with power generators have also been successful. In Vanuatu, electricity company UNELCO has been using diesel blended with coconut oil to run a large four megawatt generator.Mr Deamer says they are gradually increasing the proportion of coconut oil, which is 15 per cent now, to see how the generator performs.On Savaii island in Samoa, the electricity company has been running one generator on a coconut oil blend with success.Mr Deamer says substituting coconut oil for diesel will boost the declining copra industry.""My motivation is partly trying to keep some money going overseas here in the country instead, and keep some employment in rural areas,"" he said. ""I think it still has a future, I think we can make it happen.""Mr Cloin says the economics of using coconut oil for fuel are marginal, although the copra industry is already subsidised in many island countries, making diesel substitution more viable.""You have to understand that with normal economics, it doesn't really add up,"" he said. ""But if you agree electrification of remote islands is a good idea and subsidies are a good idea, then using coconut oil is a good idea.""-AFP","Alternative Energy, Business, Economics and Finance, Environment, Fiji, Industry, Marshall Islands, Oil and Gas, Vanuatu, ",2007-09-16T20:49:00+00:00

People are just staying indoors and we are not really getting much from the community here,"" he said.A shipping alert had been issued and the Vanuatu Maritime Authority was searching for a missing ship after it received a distress signal from an unidentified vessel earlier on Thursday.-- Reuters","Cyclone, Cyclones, Vanuatu, ",2004-02-26T04:53:00+00:00
