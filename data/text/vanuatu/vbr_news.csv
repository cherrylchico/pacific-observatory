Where there used to be about 10,000 loaves made a day, there is now only 5000-6000 loaves made. Their flour supplier, Chuan Store delivers only 20 bags of flour a day now. Prior to the flour shortage, it delivered over 30 bags.“The shortage means we can no longer deliver to businesses that order bread,” he said. “We have maintained orders and deliveries to schools because Shefa prioritises the students at this time.”“We are told that the next flour shipment should be here on 16th of June. We know if it does get here on the 16th, it may take a day or two for us to get it. Presently, there is no guarantee on whether or not our flour stock can last until then.”Brother Bakery emphasises Galini’s statement as the owner’s wife spoke for the business.“We have stopped delivering to businesses and have cut our production because of the shortage,” she said. “We are expecting the next flour shipment soon, but Brother Bakery does not have enough flour in stock to last until the next shipment arrives.”Ah Pow Bakery, on the other hand, seems confident that it has enough flour in stock to last the waiting period until the next shipment.“Ah Pow is operating as normal, there is flour in stock to last until the next shipment,” stated Wendy Jonas, the Manager of Ah Pow Bakery.Some bakeries have succumbed to the shortage, one of those being La Parisenne which posted a sign on its doors to let its customers know the bakery will be closed from the 7th of June because of the flour shortage and will let customers know when it will reopen.“As the borders are to open soon, there needs to be better planning to ensure shortages like this do not happen when we are catering to the people we invite back,” said Galini. “Bakeries and other businesses cannot operate with shortages.”"

The financing assistance will help staff ensure their lodging conditions meet the highest health and safety standards, where they can raise happy, healthy families for years to come.The quality of housing is a serious issue in Vanuatu as it has achieved the dubious distinction of ranking #1 on the 2020 World Risk Index, as evidenced by the two Category 5 cyclones that have pummeled the archipelago in just the last five years.However, a lack of supply coupled with financing difficulties has long forced many residents of Port Vila to live in crowded and unsafe conditions. Titan FX hopes that the Housing Support Program will help address a part of that problem, and also inspire other organizations to do the same. Not only does this type of initiative improve worker health and safety at home, but it goes a long way to boosting team morale and strengthening business resiliency.To learn more about this and other Titan FX’s community initiatives, including those supporting education, health, business, sports, and civic life, visit titanfx.com/vu"

Everybody walked with no restrictions now that the country is down to Level 1.All the tables in the Restaurant Wing of the Market were almost full at midday. Certainly, the tide is turning for the better as almost every one I see are not wearing any mask.While I have not heard the thumb up from the Ministry of Health to unmask, the general observation is that the country is returning to normal soon.Obviously, job creation is returning with businesses reopening to allow those who have stopped work to return to work soon.Looking into a somewhat windy Vila Harbour, it is clear that the dancing waves are also missing both local and international sea traffic while waiting for July 1st to arrive.The Caribbean Royal Cruise has promised to work with Vanuatu Authorities to pave the way to reopen the visits for the tourist liners to arrive with their most missed passengers again.All the hotels and restaurants and taxi parks are empty without our international visitors.But the signs are in place as you walk along the Seafront as far as Fatumaru Bay, to know that Port Vila is ready to welcome back the tourists.Someone said, “The beauty about being ni Vanuatu is that you smile not because of a fat wallet or purse full of cash but, because it feels good to smile with cash or no cash”.Well, the day is coming on July 1 when the economic wind is bound to fan the positive revival of economic prosperity for the people and the country."

6,https://vbr.vu/news/call-for-nationwide-consultation-on-proposed-severance-pay-increase-for-private-sector/,2022-05-28 00:05:00,Call for nationwide consultation on proposed severance pay increase for private sector,"By Jason Abel.Vanuatu Chamber of Commerce (VCCI) President, Antoine Boudier, believes a nationwide consultation on the proposed increase of private sector severance payments to two months is significant.Mr. Boudier commented that with the Government’s proposal still in discussion, he believes that a national consultation will definitely assist the government’s decision. He added that it would help everyone to see the benefits and negative aspects.Discussions into it should be addressed in steps for an essential roadmap.Mr. Boudier stated that taking such rapid decision can have side effects.The question is, ‘will there be sustainability?’ Regarding sustainability, there are several reasons that could affect businesses within both the formal and the informal sector, if such laws were gazetted.Mr. Boudier stated that they believe the government has a vision and it is best to share this vision. However, there is great concern within the private sector.He commented that while the private sector tries to improve the lives of its workers, it must improve sustainability as well. Today, there is no sustainability.“COVID-19 has affected our economy, however with the economic crisis at hand, it is a big challenge,” Boudier said.“It will affect everyone throughout the country. Severance payment will affect all citizens.“This could lead to more unemployment also.”The VCCI President stated that what the private sector is doing in Vanuatu is building capacity for the citizens.“What a company guarantees in business is assurance for its workers to be present in work and not leave immediately,” he said. “With the new proposal, we don’t know where we are heading to.”He added that a new business can face difficulties when it has to pay severance for workers annually. On top of that, this could see employees leaving out staff due to the severance demand.According to Mr. Boudier, this will see employers working for just one year and once they receive severance payment, they can stop working and there is no continuity.“If severance payment is addressed annually, this could see a company training an employer for only one year and receiving his severance will be a loss for the company’s investment towards the employer,” he said.Boudier said the VNPF contribution is likely enough.“Every month you pay VNPF for workers and whenever they leave, you won’t have any outstanding,” he said.“Concerning VNPF, today an employee pays four percent and an employer pays eight percent, adding to 12% for members. VNPF can invest better on that and receive a good return as funds are saved.”The country’s minimum wage is at VT220/hr."

The organizing committee is using the event to push for the ban.If this becomes effective, people will not be allowed to take marine life out from the area. This long-term marine conservation initiative will help combat the decline of marine species and will bring tourism benefits.Clerk of the Port Vila City Council (PVCC), Peter Sakita, said marine recreational activities are needed in the Port Vila harbour to attract tourists upon arrival, instead of just having tours around the island.A traditional marine conservation practice and protocols will be performed at Kawenu Beach, where the Port Vila Day event will be held. Cleanup has already begun at the site.Around 100 coastal plants will be planted on a 3km area stretching from the former Yacht Club to the freshwater springs at Cellovila, as part of creating a sustainable conservation and management of the harbour.The City Council and stakeholders will also be launching new business startups, which include over 30 water sports and over 50 unique beach activities.This is part of the preparedness for the first cruise ship arriving in July.The Port Vila Day Program will commence with a parade from Cello Vila. After the flag raising ceremony, a custom ceremony will be performed by the Council to the Paramount Chief of Ifira, Mantoi Paunimanu Kalsakau.The main speech will be given by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Internal Affairs, Ishmael Kalsakau.The unveiling of the Marine Conservation Plaque will be done in the afternoon followed by the marine conservation ceremony, traditional custom dances and a custom ceremony by Ifira’s Paramount Chief.There will be sport activities and presentation of prizes, live entertainment and fireworks to end the event.After many years of showcasing on Port Vila Day, PVMC, as the custodian of the Port Vila City sees appropriate to allow the local business community to host this year’s event.This is part of an approach to partner with the private sector to do development."

This was an increase of VT22 per Litre.The constant diesel and petrol price hikes are driven by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and COVID-19 pandemic.The Department of Energy explained this in a statement. “With the continuous rippling effects of COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the demand for oil gives rise to continued ascending prices,” it stated.“The crude oil price hikes are therefore reflected in the downstream side that shows in the imports of diesel in April 2022 into Vanuatu by the petroleum product supplier.“The prices are based on the cost fluctuations of the Means of Plats Singapore (MOPS), the regional pricing benchmark adopted in the downstream oil industry, including other cost components, foreign exchange rate, and other charges.”"

The forum also allowed APTC to present their plans for GEDSI.“The discussion is to ensure ‘Nothing about us, without us,’” stated APTC GEDSI Manager, Artisa Singh. She explained that the communities in GEDSI have the right to be part of the decision making when it comes to their communities, so they should have a say.The Ministry of Education and Training (MoET) presented best practices for inclusion in a formal education stream which included establishing disability resource centers.The MoET presenter, Marie Jonah, stated that the Open VEMIS data of 2021 shows interesting information where more boys than girls were dropping out of formal learning. Girls also have higher passing rates than boys, which she attributed as the fruits of the gender inclusion efforts being made.“The way forward is partnership in implementing inclusive programs and activities within the community,” said the Ministry of Justice and Community Services presenter, Ginette Morris.“Working in isolation is not bringing to reality the right of people with disabilities.”When it comes to gender inclusion, the Department of Women’s Affairs presented that increasing the participation of women in non-traditional courses in the TVET area is key to empowering women, but more needs to be done in the work environment of women in non-traditional spheres.“I have been hearing about empowerment and inclusion policies since i was in high school. I am now 35. We cannot wait another 30 years to apply these policies,” said VPride’s Executive Director, Gigi Baxter.“We cannot achieve inclusion alone, if we want to achieve inclusion and try to do it alone, we will not succeed,” the Vanuatu Society of People with Disability presenter, Judith Iakavai highlighted.“We must recognize that inclusion must be done with the effort of all.”"

However, since March of 2020 the Resort experienced a decrease in headcount by 50%, the majority of which has been natural attrition, stated Director of Sales and Marketing at the Holiday Inn, Sophia Rodwell.The resort is looking forward to employing over 170 people once Vanuatu’s international border reopens sometimes in mid-June, as having people employed now with no business is not sensible, Rodwell explained.“The resort will have a soft opening in July when the borders open. We can train staff in-house but some positions like chef need expertise,” she added.Nasama Manager, Sarah Vogelsberger, shares that Nasama is also in need of a Chef and has been putting out a vacancy for the last two years as well as advertising for staff for the last four months. With no one meeting the criteria for Chef in the country, Nasama is advertising abroad for the position.“The Nasama Resort is ready to open, but not the Nasama Restaurant. At this point in terms of staffing, I will have to say we are not ready for the border reopening just yet,” she said.Moorings on the other hand is prepared and has not closed through the pandemic. This way, it does not necessarily need to restaff but will be employing as a contingency plan in case any of the present staff choose to go abroad on seasonal work, according to the Assistant Manager of Moorings, Anita Ambong.All eyes are on the international chain resorts within the country as their readiness tells the rest of the world that Vanuatu is awake and open once more. While Holiday Inn is ready to employ in June, Warwick Le Lagon recruitment is struggling“We will be ready for the reopening on 1st of July, however, we are facing major issues in recruiting staff especially skillful staff,” said the General Manager of Warwick Le Lagon in Vanuatu, Ali Serhan.He added that Warwick will try to manage the situation, but it needs assistance from the Department of Labour in granting permits quickly, or with certain positions that Warwick cannot fill locally at this stage in order to ease the process a little bit.“One of the difficulties we have are counterpart for expats in certain positions, at the moment there are none as all staff have left,” Mr. Serhan said.Starting five weeks ago, Ramada on site staff such as gardeners, maintenance and housekeeping have been preparing Ramada room by room.“Preparations have also been made to the kitchen and restaurants and by the end of June it shall be ready to accommodate tourists,” Country Director of the Ramada Resort, Loic Bernier said.Mr. Bernier added that for the most part Ramada should be able to fill roles such as chefs, additional kitchen staff and bar and restaurant managers within the country in the next few months or after the soft opening. However, there is a little issue with recruiting skilled administration staff and Ramada is still looking to employ in areas that require a bit of skill.“Another issue is Ramada needs to employ expat staff for higher positions like General Manager, Chief Financial Officer and potentially one or two staff positions that require very high skill levels. Without the GM, Ramada cannot open,” Mr. Bernier said, adding he is confident that Ramada will be ready to open in July.Ramada is prioritizing reemploying its staff that have been away on seasonal work. Mr. Bernier mentioned as Director of Chantilly’s on the Bay, Chantilly’s is fully staffed as of this week, but Ramada is still employing.While many hospitality businesses are looking to employ, all are working to upscale operations according to what is needed by the amount of bookings that are made upon the border reopening on July 1."

16,https://vbr.vu/news/govt-eyes-minimum-wage-increase/,2022-05-30 04:28:00,GOV’T EYES MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE,"The Vanuatu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) is against the decision to have private sector employees receive a severance pay at the rate of two months’ salary, against the number of years in service. The intention to make private sector employees’ severance pay at two months’ salary, similar to the government employees was recently revealed in Parliament by the minister responsible. Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Minister of Internal Affairs, Ishmael Kalsakau, also announced theintention to increase the minimum wage. While these announcements will directly benefit workers, President of VCCI, Antoine Boudier said raising private sector’s severance payment could result in employers reducing the number of workers and closure of businesses. He stressed that raising the severance pay will also encourage an increase in the price of goods and services in the country. Boudier said instead of increasing the severance payment, the government should consider increasing the employers’ monthly contribution to the Vanuatu National Provident Fund (VNPF). Currently, both employers and employees are contributing 4% per month. Boudier said raising the employers’ VNPF contribution is more sustainable for the members, instead of burdening employers with a severance payment raise. He said these decisions cannot just happen overnight, there has to be consultations and be decided by the Tripartite Labour Advisory Committee (TLAC). Meanwhile, the Vanuatu National Workers Union (VNWU) which has been advocating for workers’ safety and rights, has welcomed the announcements. VNWU’s National Secretary, Rocky Bule, has argued that the current VT220 per hour minimum wage is too low compared to the current standard of living. He said reviewing the minimum wage was an agenda in TLAC’s last meeting held at the end of 2021. The majority of the members supported the agenda, only the VCCI was against the proposal, he conveyed. Bule said they have not discussed private sector severance payment, but it could be in the next TLAC meeting. “In my opinion, many businesses have existed many years before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. They have been successfully making millions of vatu over the past years thus, should not be complaining,” he said. “I have been having talks with many employers. I think they can afford the severance payment increase.” According to DPM Kalsakau, the raise in minimum wage and the private sector severance payment increase to two months salary should be effective by the end of this year."

Other countries that ratified the agreement include Australia, Cook Islands, Kiribati, NewZealand, Niue, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Tuvalu. During the third week into the First Ordinary Session of Parliament, 36 Members of Parliament (MP) voted for the ratification of the Bill for the PACERPLUS Agreement, while seven MPs did not support it. This was the final process for entering into the whole PACER Plus Agreement before it would be gazetted and come into effect. Vanuatu joined the signatories of the PACER Plus at the Forum Leaders Meeting in 2017. The Agreement entered into force on 13 December 2020. According to the explanatory note on PACER Plus, “this agreement is a regional trade agreement, which aims to promote regional economic integration through trade, to avoid unnecessary barriers to trade, to liberalise trade, and to promote integration between the economies of its parties. “In ratifying the PACER Plus Agreement, Vanuatu agrees to be bound by its commitments on trade in goods and services. The PACER Plus Agreement includes the development assistance, which supports the implementation of the agreement, and further spending on its aid for trade, which will enhance the participation of parties on international trade. “The PACER Plus Agreement will establish a broad framework of labour mobility cooperation, which will build labour supply capacity, and skills, and increase employment sectors and remittances. “Vanuatu supports the PACER Plus Agreement which has the link between economic development, social development and environmental protection, and the important role of development and economic cooperation in promoting sustainable development.” Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Trade, Marc Ati who presented the Bill affirmed in his address that a standalone arrangement will benefit Vanuatu through the Labour Mobility Program, under a framework on the program. From this, it will continue to support the supply of workers and enhance their skills. During a heated debate in Parliament on Tuesday this week, Leader of Opposition, Ralph Regenvanu questioned how ratifying the agreement will benefit Vanuatu. He stressed that Vanuatu does not have the capacity and systems in place to ensure that Vanuatu can benefit fully from the agreement. He also pointed out that with no systems and capacities in place, Vanuatu would not be able to know how we are being affected by the agreement. Regenvanu said from awareness and consultations conducted in the past on this controversial PACER Plus, a lot of people in the civil society have declared their disagreement with the agreement. He noted that so far Vanuatu has been exporting less than 1% of its goods while importing 33% from New Zealand and Australia. He emphasised the impact of Non Communicable Diseases which most imported food is from the two countries. While Vanuatu is putting effort to boost the tourism industry through developing and establishing ways and initiatives such as the Agri-tourism by encouraging hotels to source food and products locally, the Leader of the Opposition argued that under PACER Plus, there are restrictions on the use of local content in the industries, especially in tourism and manufacturing. Deputy Leader of Opposition and Minister of Internal Affairs Ishmael Kalsakau said now that the Bill is being passed, Vanuatu will go along with it, but if it is not workable, there is still room to remove it."

Both Russia and Ukraine are producers of grain and other food for export.Russia is one of the world’s top oil producers. The supply of its oil to Europe and other countries has been disrupted by the war therefore, the spillover effects are being felt globally.Even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, fuel prices were already rising due to the high demand and limited supply."

The moana (ocean) is the foundation of shared indigenous cultural and historical identities, it links communities here in Aotearoa to island homelands across the Pacific. The exploitation of the ocean holds much responsibility for the realities of many Pacific Islands societies today; realities that serve to shrink our options and entice our countries to repeat unsustainable patterns of economic development,” said Tuiono.Fiji reaffirmed its position to ban DSM at the Conference, declaring that mining the ocean’s floors will lead to permanent and irreparable impacts.The PPADSM supports the statement of Fiji’s Attorney-General, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, that “we cannot destroy what we do not understandand that there is renewed momentum to oppose DSM from across the region – and we must build on it.“We welcome Fiji’s leadership on this issue. It is vital for Pacific Island nations to make a strong stand against this exploitative industry that has the potential to cause substantial harm to our Ocean,” said PPADSM Chair, MP Ralph Regenvanu.PPADSM also welcomed the decision by the Tuvalu Government to rescind its plans to advance proposals for DSM.Tuvalu’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Kofe said the challenge with Tuvalu is the Seabed Minerals Act which was passed by the previous government which allows mining companies to apply to Tuvalu. But he added that his government is not in support and came to the decision of revoking its sponsorship of Circular Metals Ltd.“We are pleased to know that Tuvalu will revoke its sponsorship of mining company Circular Metals, and we remain ready to assist Tuvalu,” said Regenvanu.He added that political momentum is growing in the region on DSM with the launch of a new high-level regional political alliance against this destructive industry – the Pacific Parliamentarians Alliance on DSM.“We the PPADSM collective is also appealing to Pacific leaders, parliamentarians, legislators, senators, and governors to join this Pacific momentum to protect our ocean.”“The establishment of the Alliance is crucial and will put pressure on individual states and mining companies that have intentions of moving ahead with proposals on DSM in the Pacific Ocean,” MP Regenvanu said.“The PPADSM believes that as Pacific islanders, it’s our moral obligation to care for our Ocean. It sustains us and gives us our identity.“We must oppose all attempts that are made to advance DSM in our region.”"

The Association mentioned that currently Air Vanuatu offers only connected flights to Santo.In the past, connecting flights at times may be an expensive exercise when flights get delayed or are full, depending on the domestic market.There were quite a number of concerns also raised over Air Vanuatu’s flight schedule to Funafuti, Tuvalu particularly within the tourism sector. The STA stated that if Brisbane flights resumes in Santo, it will be a boost for tourism operators based on Vanuatu’s biggest island.The Association is hopeful that by the end of the year, there will be some rescheduled flight plans. The STA affirmed that once bookings are set, it will assist Air Vanuatu’s decision making in resuming Brisbane flights to Santo and Tanna.With the government recently signing a VT7 billion contract with the Chinese Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC)for the extension of the Pekoa Airport runway, it will be a boost for Santo tourism and a must to receive international flights in the near future. As the Bauerfield runway was recently flooded by heavy rain during cyclone Gina, Santo could be an option for direct flights if a similar situation occurs again.There are plans as well for Vanuatu to support direct flights from Asia, especially once the extension is complete."

Foster, SPC’s Director of Corporate Communications highlighted the benefit of the partnership, saying, “The development issues faced in the Pacific can seem overwhelmingly complex. Journalists play a critical role in making these issues more easily understood, and in highlighting the considerable progress and leadership being now shown across region. This partnership will help bring about better understanding of the cutting-edge work being done to support our communities.”Internews will use this agreement as part of its ongoing commitment to strengthen the professional capacity of local journalists, media outlets and networks to better report on the challenges faced by the people of the Pacific Islands and the efforts made to address them. Internews will work with local journalists to amplify the voices of women and vulnerable groups who are most at risk of climate change and environmental degradation.“Internews is an international development media organisation, and our mission is to empower local media in the Pacific, to give people the news and information they need, the ability to connect, and the means to make their voices heard,” said Rowan Reid, Internews Programme Manager – Asia.He added that “We believe partnerships are crucial to our work and without key partnerships we would be unable to deliver to the communities and people which we ultimately serve. To this end we have a guidance which is used to train our staff and onboard partners on how we commit to working together and improve our partnerships over time, and we want our partners to hold us accountable to them.”Early efforts from this partnership will likely explore the idea of creating a network of Pacific journalists and scientific community representatives along with joint training workshops, media field visits, development of reporters’ resources and training materials."
26,https://vbr.vu/news/pacific-labour-mobility-growth-winners-and-losers/,2022-05-07 00:28:00,Pacific labour mobility growth: winners and losers,"One of Scott Morrison’s biggest announcements from last August’s 51st Pacific Islands Forum was to double the number of Pacific workers in Australia by March 2022 to at least 25,000. The government has come close to hitting that target, saying that as of last month, 23,000 workers were in Australia under the two PALM schemes, the multi-year Pacific Labour Scheme (PLS) and the Seasonal Worker Programme (SWP).Which countries are these Pacific workers now from? What is the relative size of the two schemes? What is the gender composition of the workers, and what sectors are they working in?These questions are tricky to answer due to COVID-19, which has resulted in longer stays and the introduction of the COVID-19 Pandemic Event (408) visa. Between May 2020 and December 2021, 7,225 Pacific workers transitioned to the 408 visa, the vast majority of them SWP workers. Unfortunately, while we have data on the number of SWP and PLS visa holders in country, we don’t know how many 408-visa holders are still in Australia. An estimate on the number of Pacific workers in Australia is given in figure 1, which shows that there were almost 20,000 by the end of December last year. Some of the 408 visa holders would have returned home, so this is an overestimate, but not a huge one. We know that between August 2021 and February 2022, only 601 SWP workers and 37 PLS workers returned home.We can also look at arrivals. Between April 2020 and February 2022, 6,547 PLS workers and 15,805 SWP workers arrived in Australia. Between April and August 2020, during the temporary pause on worker arrivals, the average was just 75 a month. From September 2020 to March 2021 the average was 598 a month. And from April 2021 to February 2022, the average was 1,617 a month. An assumption that this average continued for March and April, and that the number of returns remained fairly low, is consistent with the number of workers in country in April hitting 23,000 or even higher.Several countries have gained from PALM growth, but some have missed out, and a few have even seen declines. For the SWP, our analysis includes both those currently in Australia on an SWP visa, and all 408 PALM country visa holders. (Excluded are the not insignificant number who have moved onto bridging visas after making an asylum claim.)Vanuatu has retained its dominant position in the SWP, and Tonga has slipped marginally. The big SWP gainer has been Samoa, whose share has increased from 5% at the end of 2020 to 16% at the end of 2021. The big loser has been Timor-Leste, which was excluded from the SWP restart because of COVID-19 outbreaks, and which has plummeted from third to fifth slot, with its share falling from 17% to 5%.Samoa has also been the biggest gainer from the PLS expansion, its share doubling from 13% to 25% over the course of a year. Solomon Islands has also done extremely well, becoming the biggest source country, with a 29% share. The Solomon Islands government has therefore well exceeded its target of 1,150 PLS workers by 2023, overcoming its historic under-representation in Australian labour mobility programs. Fiji’s PLS numbers have grown, but its share has halved.The figure below shows combined numbers for the PLS and SWP. Vanuatu now has about one-third of all workers across the two schemes, Tonga and Samoa about one-fifth each, Solomon Islands 13%, and other countries 5% or less. Of the big four, Vanuatu has maintained its combined share, Tonga has lost it, and Samoa and Solomons have gained it.Some of the national growth rates are truly phenomenal: Samoa has seen growth of 540%, Solomons 666%. But other countries have missed out. We have already mentioned Timor-Leste, but PNG numbers remain small, with growth of only 20% and total numbers of less than 200.The SWP remains dominated almost entirely by horticulture. The largest industry for PLS workers remains meat processing (67%) with horticulture and agriculture (24%) in second place. All other sectors are tiny: third is aged care services at 2% of all workers.As at the end of 2021, only 10% of PLS meat industry workers and 37% of horticulture workers are women, resulting in an on overall female share of the PLS workforce of about 19%: hardly different to earlier. Unfortunately, we could not obtain SWP gender data.These figures confirm that the Pacific labour schemes have been transformed through the pandemic. The last pre-COVID year, 2018-19, saw 12,200 SWP workers arriving in Australia, and at that time the PLS had around 150 workers. Based on July 2021 to February 2022 data, there will have been another 12,000 SWP arrivals in 2021-22, but that is on top of the 6,000+ SWP workers who have stayed on using a 408 visa. In addition, the PLS has become a significant component of Pacific labour mobility, with some 6,000 workers at the end of December 2021 compared to virtually none at the start of the pandemic.While the growth in the SWP and PLS is impressive, it is also worth noting that the share of the PALM labour force from Tonga and Samoa has increased from 33% to 40%, from 2,500 to 7,900. These two countries are already among the most remittance-dependent countries in the world, and it is not surprising that complaints have started to arise about brain drain. One Samoan recently commented on the Devpolicy blog that “we are losing a lot of skilled labour to both schemes, with many resigning from their jobs and entering into the schemes for better money. We are losing qualified teachers, nurses, chefs, and the like to these schemes.” The loss of skilled workers is one of the reasons Samoa’s government has announced a review of the programs. Local businesses are also complaining.Brain drain complaints tend, like those of family separation, to receive less attention than worker mistreatment in Australia, but are no less serious. They are especially acute for the PLS, where employers are more likely to look for people with pre-existing skills, even in a different area. While the PALM schemes have many benefits, they are not targeted enough to countries – such as PNG and Timor-Leste – that stand to benefit the most from labour mobility opportunities but have the least access to the Australian labour market. The Pacific Integration Visa, promoted by Labor, would be much better targeted (through use of country quotas) and should be adopted by whoever wins the election.Note: Data sources used in this article are, for arrivals, Department of Home Affairs ‘Overseas Arrivals and Departures’; for workers in-country, Department of Home Affairs, ‘Temporary visa holders in Australia’; and for PLS gender and sector composition, data was provided by Pacific Labour Facility, accurate as of 7 March 2022.Disclosure: This research was supported by the Pacific Research Program, with funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

However, it does not specifically mention any particular technology or company.Considering Vanuatu’s recovery as a priority, the TRBR then granted an Exception to Starlink for a period of six months.The Exception is strictly for government agencies’ use of the terminals. Installations were to be coordinated through the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) provided by Starlink and type approved by TRBR, to facilitate the emergency response and delivery of relief supplies during the SOE.The coordination and approval of equipment usage and deployment are based on the NDMO’s recovery plans.According to a source, the Prime Minister’s office purchased 30 Starlink equipment during this time for use during the SOE, alongside the NDMO. Starlink has been established in five Provincial Emergency Operation Centres (PEOC), according to a source from the NDMO headquarters.However, reports suggest that some government officials are using the Starlink equipment supplied for emergency usage in their private homes, rather than in the workplace. The Daily Post was unable to confirm these rumors from the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) due to the responsible person’s absence.If Starlink complies with all applicable regulations determined by the Department of Customs and Inland Revenue (DCIR) and the Vanuatu Foreign Investment Promotion Authority (VFIPA), consumers will be able to continue utilising Starlink’s services beyond the SOE. Fulfilling these legal formalities will lead to the TRBR issuing a licence permitting Starlink’s operations in Vanuatu.In order to be granted a broadcasting licence by the TRBR, Starlink must establish a physical presence in Vanuatu, including an office. This requirement is based on Vanuatu being a sovereign country with its own laws, such as the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission (VFSC) regulations. Physical presence enables various benefits such as paying taxes to the government, providing consumer protection with an office for assistance, and employing local staff. Additionally, Vanuatu’s cash economy allows rural individuals without visa cards to pay for Starlink services directly in cash at the Vanuatu office.The slow process for Starlink to obtain a licence from the TRBR is believed to be due to the issue of office establishment. Despite operating as a Business to Customer model, where products and services are sold directly to end-users, some consumers in Vanuatu purchase Starlink equipment by ordering it from Australia, even though Starlink has no physical presence there. The equipment is then brought to Vanuatu by plane.To prevent the dissemination of false information on social media, the TRBR emphasises that the Exception granted to Starlink does not permit the company to provide its services to the public. It also reminds everyone of the importance of adhering to Vanuatu’s legislation, including the TRBR Act, as violations can have severe consequences."
28,https://vbr.vu/news/vanuatu-banking-sector-recovers/,2023-05-31 04:38:00,Vanuatu Banking Sector Recovers,"According to the annual results published by Vanuatu’s banks, excluding the National Bank, the overallperformance of the banking sector in 2022 showed a strong rebound in profitability. Prior to the arrival ofCOVID in 2019, the combined net profit of Vanuatu’s banks was Vatu 48M, which significantly contrasted with the Vatu 1.5BN profit generated in 2018. The 2019 results already indicated deteriorating business conditions compared to 2018, with falling net interest income, increasing bad debts, and higher liquidity on balance sheets. The COVID-19 crisis exacerbated the existing challenges.During COVID, the risk appetite of the banks varied. While some banks provided liquidity lifelines to support struggling businesses, others faced clients who were unable to cope, leading to liquidation or closure. The banks faced a delicate situation as each client represented a future revenue stream. Lowering the risk appetite and discontinuing support to pressured clients during the pandemic could result in losing not only clients but also potential future revenue streams once the crisis subsided. The decision to provide additional loans to sustain struggling businesses during the crisis hinged on a critical question for each Relationship Manager: whether they were adding more liabilities to a business destined to fail or genuinely assisting the business in surviving the crisis and emerging intact. Risk appetite played a crucial role. The consequences of these decisions have had an impact on post-COVID profits.In July 2022, as the borders reopened and the COVID pandemic receded, the response of each bank during the crisis became apparent. The combined profitability of Vanuatu’s banks from 2018 to 2022 is as follows:2018: VT 1,577m2019: VT 48m2020: VT 111m2021: VT 1,014m2022: VT 1,760m (excluding NBV)In 2022, even excluding the results of the National Bank (NBV), the total bank profits rebounded to exceed 2018 levels. BRED Bank emerged as the market leader, demonstrating dominance in terms of market share, profitability, and positive feedback in social media surveys. In a surveyconducted on Yumi Tok Tok Stret’s Facebook page, BRED Bank was voted the best bank for personal and business banking by 52% of respondents. In 2022, BRED Bank generated a profit of VT 1,354m, surpassing the next best performing bank, ANZ, which made a profit of VT 498m. BSP experienced a slight drop in profitability compared to previous years but still achieved profits of VT 110m in 2022.On the other end of the spectrum, Wanfuteng Bank faced significant challenges. By the end of 2022, the bank had accumulated combined losses of VT 1,299m since its launch. Although the losses decreased gradually each year, it remains unclear when or if the bank will eventually become profitable and whether its shareholders will continue injecting capital to cover the losses. Additionally, the bank’s lack of correspondent banking arrangements and limited access to foreign currency transactions have raised doubts about its future operations."
29,https://vbr.vu/news/starlink-registers-trademark-in-vanuatu/,2023-06-14 08:00:00,Starlink Registers Trademark in Vanuatu,"By Doddy Morris.The Vanuatu Intellectual Property Office (VanIPO) has confirmed that Starlink have registered its trademark in Vanuatu and are in the process to obtain its broadcasting licence.Starlink will be now in contact with the relevant Government Agencies including Vanuatu Financial Services Commission (VFSC), Vanuatu Foreign Investment Promotion Authority (VFIPA) and the Department of Customs and Inland Revenue (DCIR), to ensure it complies with all relevant laws of the country.Once these legal formalities are fulfilled by Starlink, the Telecommunications Radio Communications and Broadcasting Regulator (TRBR) will issue a licence that will permit Starlink’s operations in Vanuatu.However, Vanuatu people are already using Starlink despite the company not being approved to operate and before they registered their trademark with VanIPO due to its faster, smoother web browsing.The accelerated rates Ni-Vanuatu experience makes it possible to access websites and services more quickly, stream content in HD, and use applications with less lag time.This is especially helpful for people who live in rural areas because they frequently lack access to high-speed internet, allowing them to fully enjoy all that the internet has to offer.A few people have alerted the TRBR that they are Starlink users, and the TRBR has been collaborating closely with customs to check all incoming equipment.With that, the TRBR have also warned that any of the company’s equipment brought into the country would be confiscated until it gets a licence.According to Radio New Zealand, Starlink did not know how this could have happened and they have no idea of what’s going on or why people are bringing their devices to Vanuatu.They believed people possess the devices from either New Zealand or Australia and it to Vanuatu.During the aftermath of the two past cyclones Kevin and Judy, reports states that an Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) officer of the World Food Programme (WFP), pre-configured and activated 10 satellite connectivity terminals loaned to the government of Vanuatu by Starlink to facilitate communications in the emergency response.The Pacific ETC officer also trained technical staff from the National Disaster Management Organisation (NDMO) on the configuration, activation, and maintenance of the terminals.On April, the Pacific ETC Officer also travelled to Ambae and installed a Starlink terminal at the PENAMA Provincial Emergency Operation Centre (PPEOC), as well as in Tanna, which was prioritised by the NDMO.The TBRB has clarified via a statement that their office is not mandated by law to restrict or block any international companies such as Starlink to enter Vanuatu’s market.However, the TRBR Act mandates that any telecom companies interested to operate in Vanuatu must obtain a telecom licence from the TRBR office.The licence can only be granted by the TRBR if the registration process for a business licence is completed and approvals are certified by the VFIPA, VFSC, and DCIR.The TRBR office is not required by law to set a deadline for Starlink to complete its registration, nor in the position of Starlink or its Agent to provide an update of its registration with other Government Agencies.The question on when will Starlink will get its broadcasting from TRBR depends on its registration with VIFPA, VFSC, and the DCIR."

The office of the lawyer said they have filed complaints of fraud, misappropriation, conversion, theft, and illegal activities against Li.According to the lawyer’s office, their clients in Dubai allegedly did not receive any financial report from Li for over four years. This has forced the owner of the car dealer to send his wife to Port Vila on the eve of the Easter weekend to find out more about the status of their business.When his wife entered the office at the Melcofe area, she found that there were no financial reports or records of the use of the rental cars. It is also alleged that Li did not issue receipts when the cars were rented and that the payments were all done in cash.There are allegations that some of the cars were rented for a period of one year and that there are outstanding monies paid by Ni-Vanuatu for the vehicles. It is also alleged that Li has taken over the ownership of VRent A Car.The wife of the owner has since locked the office at Melcofe and removed most of the cars since Tuesday this week. The Daily Post attempted to reach Li by phone, but he was unreachable. The Vanuatu Police Force (VPF) has confirmed that they have received a complaint against him and have commenced their investigations."
32,https://vbr.vu/news/south-africas-wanted-fugitives-now-vanuatu-citizens/,2023-04-13 08:00:00,South Africa’s wanted fugitives now Vanuatu citizens.,"By Hilaire Bule.Vanuatu’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) had advised Vanuatu’s Citizenship Office of the hostile information against corruption-accused fugitive Gupta brothers – Atul and Rajesh – on two separate occasions in 2018. This was disclosed when the FIU issued a statement yesterday to clarify its position on the controversial issue of the Gupta brothers now being Vanuatu citizens.The FIU noted that The South Africa Times online service articulated the new citizenship of the Gupta brothers and the wanted notice issued against them by the South African authorities. It implied that their new citizenship was a new development to the criminal investigation team. The FIU said the Gupta brothers and their respected families did apply for Vanuatu citizenship under the Development Support Program (DSP) in February 2018.“This Office identified adverse information against the brothers and informed the Citizenship Office accordingly on 4th and 27th of February 2018,” the FIU revealed. “On around 5th of July 2018, a fresh application for the same clients was received, and this Office issued the same response to the Citizenship Office.“After numerous meetings and correspondences on this matter, on around 2nd April 2019, this Office issued another letter to the Citizenship Office maintaining its position of adverse information identified against the Gupta brothers.“This stated clearly that the brothers were subject to criminal investigations in South Africa. The onus was placed on the discretionary authority of the Citizenship Office and the Citizenship Screening Committee.“Thereafter, FIU was unaware of the Gupta brothers’ citizenship application nor received a request for a fresh review of their applications. Nonetheless, our formal position remains unchanged.”Since the Gupta brothers made global headlines, the Citizenship Office and the Department of Immigration are distancing themselves and declining to confirm whether the Guptas are currently residing in Vanuatu.The Vanuatu Daily Post made numerous attempts to the two departments since Tuesday this week for confirmation of Vanuatu citizenship, but their response is, “We are working on the issue”.Meanwhile, police sources said they are aware the two brothers have been in and out of the country. Another source claimed the two brothers are currently in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE).A source close to the FIU said in February 2018, an agent submitted the Guptas’ applications to the FIU, but he was advised about the identification of investigation against his clients.The source said in July 2018, the same applications went through the FIU office again but from a different agent. According to the source, the second agent had pressured the FIU staff, but they did not yield to the pressure.A government source said the Citizenship Program has been abused and manipulated by politicians for their personal interests.“If FIU staff were pressured, it is because politicians who are Members of Parliament (MPs) are also agents, and they used their political influence on civil servants,” the government source said.According to information received by the Vanuatu Daily Post, some MPs and politicians are using the names of their relatives as agents, but they are the ones collecting the money and not the person whose name is in the agent document.Vanuatu has been making global headlines since the Easter weekend in the Bloomberg, BBC, The New York Times, Financial Times, and The South African website to name a few after it emerged the corruption-accused fugitive Gupta brothers have acquired Vanuatu citizenship.The APA reported South Africa’s Ministry of Justice Director General (DG) Doctor Mashabane saying he learnt that the Guptas were now citizens of Vanuatu following communication his office received from the UAE last week.The DG said this was a new development because previously the Guptas’ status was that they were carrying South African passports.“It was previously reported last month that the fugitive brothers were seeking asylum in Cameroon and Central African Republic,” the APA stated.“In the same communication Pretoria learnt that the UAE had dismissed on technical grounds the extradition of the Guptas, who are running away from justice in South Africa in an alleged corruption scandal that involved the capture of state apparatus during former president Jacob Zuma’s administration between 2008 and 2018.“The Indian-born brothers left the country for Dubai after being sought in South Africa to face criminal charges on the allegations concerning the dealings of their companies and government under Zuma, who described them as family friends.”Furthermore, Sowetan Live reported the Gupta brothers no longer have International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) Red Notices attached to their names, thus South Africa’s extradition request was dismissed by the UAE.A Red Notice is issued when a member country seeks assistance to locate and arrest an individual with the aim of having them extradited to face a criminal charge.In the duo’s case, the notices lapsed once their warrants of arrest in the UAE were issued and executed, thus there will have to be applications for new Red Notices.Algoa FM, the leading South African commercial radio station, reflected the Gupta duo are implicated in crimes, which cost the South African government over R250 billion, and billions more in lost economic growth and lost jobs."

They have asked for our help during this crisis and we will do our utmost to assist them,” said Solomon Airlines CEO Kraus.Solomon Airlines Twin Otter aircraft registered H4-OTA and crew transferred to Vanuatu on April 5, 2023 to be based in Port Vila. The aircraft departed from Honiara to Santa Cruz then onwards to Santo, Vanuatu, before ultimately arriving in Port Vila.In January this year, the CEOs of Solomon Airlines and Air Vanuatu met for two days of discussions to further their Melanesian ties and discuss greater cooperation between the national carriers.“We are seeing renewed and more comprehensive partnerships with our neighbouring Pacific Islands and other national carriers in our region, and as such in good times and in difficult times we can maximise opportunities and provide support to each other,” Mr. Kraus said.Vanuatu remains under a State of Emergency due to widespread damage to housing, telecommunications and infrastructure caused by the extreme weather events earlier this month.Category 4 TCs Judy and Kevin swept through the country two days apart, followed by magnitude 6.5 and magnitude 5.4 earthquakes which struck the island of Espiritu Santo hours apart.Initial reports from Vanuatu’s National Disaster Management Office indicated about 80 percent of the country’s population of 320,000 has been affected, including 125,500 children."

The airline has confirmed that their aircraft has been grounded in Australia since last Friday.If Air Vanuatu flies to New Zealand on Wednesdays and Saturdays, as stated by the office, the airline could potentially lose over VT37 million for the four days they are unable to fly. Similarly, for the Australian routes, they could potentially lose over VT131 million for the 13 days they are unable to fly.One of the hotels in Port Vila that accommodated some of the Air Vanuatu guests told the Daily Post that they have three different rates, with the main rate being VT24,000 per night.Air Vanuatu has also announced that they will be paying for the accommodation of stranded passengers in their respective ports due to the waiting for parts for their Boeing 737. In Port Vila alone, if 176 guests from Australia are stranded, their accommodation for 12 nights will be over VT50 million with a room rate of VT24,000 per night."

These analysed, modelled data will constitute an aid in decisions for the study of climate change and will help reducing the impacts of natural disasters such as tsunamis and earthquakes.The company Pacific Peering commits itself to making available free of charge the information from the SMART sensors to the scientific, civil protection, and meteorological agencies of both countries.Furthermore, Pacific Peering welcomes the announcement, by the President of the French Republic during his speech to the French community in Vanuatu on 28 July 2023, of the enhancing of the SMART component within the TAM-TAM project.In a region already impacted by natural disasters and the effects of climate change, this new device and its “civil protection” component will offer additional protection to the 650,000 inhabitants directly concerned, as well as to the properties and economic assets located near the coasts. Pacific Peering, whose ambition is to become the leading French SMART provider, is a key-player in the development of international communications, implementing major projects, which contribute to promoting scientific research and protecting the environment.“This ambitious project reinforces our commitment towards technological innovation and environmental preservation,” said Laurent Foulonneau, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Pacific Peering.“We are proud to play an active role in this international collaboration on seeking to address global challenges related to climate change,” said Simon Fletcher, ICL Ltd Board Member."

If not, the owner, master, or bosun of the vessel may be found guilty of an offense and could face a fine of up to VT500,000 or imprisonment for up to one year, or both.Additionally, if demanded by any licensing officer, failure to produce the vessel’s safety certificate and the relevant certificates of competency for the officers, engineers, or mechanics onboard can lead to a fine of up to VT100,000 or imprisonment for up to three months, or both.The VMSA boss urged vessel owners to promptly sort out their fees to have the detention lifted. Once the necessary fees are paid, the vessels will be inspected by VMSA inspectors to ensure they meet the required safety standards before resuming their services.Commissioner Napuati expressed concern that some ship owners failed to apply for the mandatory survey as required by the Act, despite being given sufficient time to do so.The deadline for compliance was set at the end of July. The Act stipulates that vessel owners must apply for a survey, along with the prescribed fee, at least two months before the desired effective date of the safety certificate.Napuati acknowledged the efforts of some vessel companies that complied with the regulations, including Vanuatu Cargo, Vanuatu Ferry I and Vanuatu Ferry II, HELPR 1, and Tug Warringa.Commissioner Napuati called on all banana boat and Game Fishing operators to ensure they also promptly sort out their fees to avoid facing similar actions by the VMSA.The VMSA’s strict enforcement of the Shipping Act is aimed at ensuring the safety and integrity of maritime operations within Vanuatu’s waters."

We can do that for you at minimum extra cost.“If you are from another country, talk to us and we will tailor your souvenir to mark your visit to Vanuatu a memorable one. Give us a bit of time and come back to pick it up.”Whatever the vendors display in their hands, their President says they want to sell them all during the celebrations and make way for new arrivals from the islands to continue to promote indigenous talents through new ‘made in Vanuatu’ products.“Please do not miss this opportunity and take home to your community, island, or your country of origin a souvenir to be proud of,” she said."

This is unique,” Tamara said.“One of them is respect for our parents. When children begin to wander outside the family circle then negative things begin to happen.“They smoke, do drugs, steal, drink alcohol and even cross the last line to consider taking either their own or another person’s life.”"

While they are grateful for Oxfam’s support, they remain open to receiving assistance from business houses and are actively seeking additional funding and support from other sectors, companies, government bodies, and NGOs.Mr. Marawotu expressed the Association’s joy and appreciation for the significant assistance received from Oxfam, emphasising that it is the first time they have been supported on such a scale by an organisation like Oxfam."

VNPF believes festivals like MACFEST which promote culture are important for the well-being of its members, he said.The AGM said MACFEST is an opportunity for its members to learn and celebrate not only Vanuatu’s culture and tradition but also those from other Melanesian countries.Organisers of the MACFEST commended VNPF for demonstrating commitment to preserve and promote the countries’ diverse cultural traditions. The sponsorship will enable artists, performers, and cultural enthusiasts from across the Melanesian region to come together and celebrate their shared heritage.“The festival has not only been a celebration of art, music, dance, and storytelling, but also a platform for cultural exchange, unity, and understanding. It has strengthened the bonds between our Melanesian brothers and sisters, fostering a deeper appreciation for our collective identity,” the organisers conveyed in a statement.This is not the first time for VNPF to sponsor such an important event. VNPF was the main sponsor for the broadcasting of last year’s World Cup to members.Through this latest sponsorship to MACFEST, VNPF is given a free space at one of the festival venues to promote the Fund and its services to the public.The AGM assured all members that their funds are safe, as the VT1 million sponsorship is sourced from the VNPF’s operational budget. According to him, this year’s budget is around VT400 million.“It’s part of our annual budget. Social responsibility is included in our yearly budget and we ensure we spend responsibly,” he said.As part of its social responsibility, VNPF is also required to declare annual interest rate for members each financial year.AGM Edwin assured members that the 2021 interest rate is expected this month as planned, following the release of the year’s audited financial statement. The financial statement for 2022 is expected later in September.The financial statements of 2021 and 2022 could not be released earlier due to the COVID-19 crisis. However, the AGM has assured that they are committed to make sure that the audits are finalised before the members’ interest rate are declared by the VNPF Board."

In addition, they will also provide services to and from Funafuti.“This is exciting for us. We had previously been operating services to Tuvalu on a fortnightly basis to support connectivity to Tuvalu and Australia,” he said.“Moving forward, we wanted to continue with the service. It also supports our plan and growth moving forward to provide connectivity to key Pacific Island countries.“We have had a longstanding relation with Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. We work closely with Air New Guinea and the Solomon airlines. Once they announce their plans and resumption of services, Air Vanuatu will resume its coaching services on those carriers.“Air Vanuatu is pretty excited to resume services. For the last two years, movement and connectivity has been stalled. We are now able to offer weekly services, allowing not just the movement of passengers between Vanuatu, Australia, New Zealand and our regional partners but importantly more additional space to move cargo, in and out of Vanuatu.”He pointed out that during the pandemic, cargo has been a lifeline for Air Vanuatu.“We have been operating on a fortnightly service, to Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia and Fiji, and that has been vital in ensuring that businesses have been able to get their goods in and out of Vanuatu,” he said.Mr. Wilson stated that domestically, Air Vanuatu will continue with its previous schedule. He added the schedule is in place to ensure and support again connectivity from Port Vila to Santo, Tanna and Malekula.He commented that they will maintain the schedule flight throughout the year, to allow their passengers to connect in and around their domestic network.Regarding airfares, Mr Wilson commented that at the moment, the fares will be based on what they previously had on the market.“We have to remain competitive, and more importantly, we are like any other business. All airline companies around the world affected with what is currently happening in Europe, and that is impacting the cost on our fuel,” he said.“It is something the Management is courteous about, and we will have to review if warranted.”"

The total amount credited to members’ accounts then was VT333, 218, 155.The interest rate for 2018 was 1% with around VT200 million credited to members’ savings. VNPF declared an interest of 1.2% interest for the 2019 financial year with VT254,420,000 paid to all members.In his statement yesterday, Minister Koanapo said VNPF continues to grow bigger and stronger over the past years.“In 2020, VNPF paid a total of VT1.6 billion to members as COVID-19 hardship benefits. VNPF also made a historical landmark, by introducing withdrawals of members’ benefits at the age of 47. Withdrawals amounted to VT180 million.“Despite challenges of COVID-19 and huge spendings in 2020, VNPF made a net profit of VT288,875,000 compared to VT808,222,000 in 2019.This is a decline of almost 64%, highly attributed to COVID-19.“Despite the decline in net profit, the total assets for the fund increased by 6.3%, that’s from VT22.5 billion in 2019 to VT23.9 billion in 2020.“Our total members funds in the members’ accounts also shows an increase of 4.8% in 2020, from VT21.3 billion to VT22.4 billion,” he conveyed.Minister Koanapo stressed that VNPF is also affected negatively by COVID-19 experiencing a huge reduction in employers’ contribution payments.He acknowledged the VNPF Board, General Manager (GM) Parmod Achary and the management for working hard to steer the Fund to achieving great results.Yesterday’s declaration of the 2020 interest was done in the presence of officers from the Ministry of Finance and VNPF at the new VNPF Office, located at the VNPF Plaza."

They have lifted their health restrictions and decided to reopen their borders.”He said the reopening of the borders will require substantial logistical organization, and therefore a certain amount of time.Ledoux had written an open letter which was published in the Daily Post on Tuesday, April 19 2022 asking the government to end curfew, in order for him to operate his business as usual.He explained it was very hard for him and his staff to meet the curfew time because they have to clean up the restaurant ready for the next day, in order to maintain their limited clients that they had during the lockdown.Ledoux added to avoid to breach of the curfew order, he was forced to rent a hotel room at Moorings, next to his restaurant to avoid breaching curfew hours.The curfew was lifted by the government on the third day (April 22, 2022), after the publication of Ledoux’s open letter. Ledoux’s friends have congratulated him for his courage to take a stand.“His restaurant will be blessed because he has decided to speak out,” an Au Fare client said.Meanwhile, last week the Port Vila Magistrate Court commenced with the plea session for over 30 people who were arrested by police for breaching the curfew order."
51,https://vbr.vu/news/oxfam-vanuatu-changing-perceptions-on-gender-inclusion/,2022-05-03 00:48:00,Oxfam Vanuatu changing perceptions on gender inclusion,"By Alrenze Nicky.Oxfam Vanuatu’s disaster ready program is changing people’s mindsets on gender inclusion in SHEFA Province.Vanuatu Humanitarian Team Coordinator at Oxfam Vanuatu, Glen Pakoa, said people’s perceptions now on the importance of disaster preparedness are starting to change.“We are starting to see that Community Disaster Climate Change Committees (CDCCCs) are now including women as members of the committees. In the past only men were involved but today more women are included in the committees taking up important roles,” he said.He said communities are starting to integrate gender inclusion into their recruitment processes and their meeting spaces.“We know that women’s roles in disaster preparedness and responses are very important and so we try to push for gender equality in the CDCCCs set ups. Women and girls must be involved.”Pakoa said Oxfam’s disaster ready program is also building people’s capacity.“People are now motivated and taking up initiatives to build community evacuation centers to prepare for disasters,” he said.He said recently the Eton Community on Efate have been raising money to build a community evacuation center and that is how the disaster ready program is motivating people to take up initiatives to prepare for disasters. Erangorango Community through their CDCCCs took the initiative to grow a garden and are now harvesting food from the garden to make money to assist families in the communities during disasters.“These are the things we want to see happening in the communities, change of hearts, and change of mindsets of community leaders, community members and CDCCCs members. People taking ownership to prepare their communities for disasters,” he said.“Community owned projects or community owned activities are the ones that can last. If we go into communities to try and push them to do things without them having the heart to do these things, the programs won’t last in the communities,” he said.Pakoa says if communities take ownership of any projects or activities then the projects will sustain.Monitoring Evaluation Officer at Oxfam Vanuatu, Sairos Maltok, said for the past ten years people don’t have enough knowledge on disaster preparedness but now major changes are happening in the communities as people come to understand the importance of disaster preparedness.“People are starting to understand disaster risks and what they should be doing to prepare and respond to disasters,” he said.Maltok said in this recent COVID-19 community outbreak, communities have responded effectively and were able to work closely with the health authority.“Most of the CDCCCs took their roles seriously during this COVID-19 outbreak which is helping the authorities a lot,” he said.Pakoa says the Cyclone Pam in 2015 came as a wakeup call for everyone in Vanuatu, especially the NGOs working in the humanitarian sector and the government to upscale their disaster preparedness activities.“People’s knowledge on disaster risks and disaster preparedness have increased a lot after Cyclone Pam, I think programs such as the Australian Humanitarian Partnerships Disaster Ready Program in Vanuatu, is really needed in the years to come to continue building communities capacities around disaster ready,” he said.“Even though Oxfam is not working directly with the Ministry of Health to respond to the COVID-19 situation, we are very happy to that the Ministry is utilizing the structure we have set in place, especially the CDCCs.”"

Peace Corps Vanuatu has a special designated team who takes charge of SAAM activities every year.The one-hour online webinar was broadcasted live on the Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation (VBTC) Facebook page, Television Blong Vanuatu (TBV) as well as on Radio Vanuatu. The seven panelists are experts in their respective fields. They include Dr. Jeffrey Karae, Cyber Security Consultant at Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO); Sergeant Rayndol Ala, Community Liaison Officer at the Vanuatu Police Force Cybercrime Unit; Mrs. Miriam Bule, Senior Counselor & Counsellor Manager from the Vanuatu Women’s Center; Ms Tristelle Karae, National Child Social Welfare Coordinator at the Department of Community Services; Mr. Jackson Miake, Director of Vanuatu Internet Governance Forum; Mr. Peter Napuwat, National Mental Health Coordinator at the Ministry of Health; and last but not the least, Mr. Stevenson Liu, President of Media Association Vanuatu (MAV) at VBTC. The discussions were moderated by Peace Corps Vanuatu’s very own Safety Security Manager, Mrs. Judy Williau.Prior to the online webinar, VBTC hosted a “Talk Back Show” on the SAAM theme and a majority of callers acknowledged that online abuse is indeed an increasing issue in communities across Vanuatu, especially during the recent lockdown. A good number of questions discussed by the panelists was extracted from this “Talk Back Show”.To highlight a few, one of the questions asked was “What is online abuse?” Mr. Miake in his response, stated that online abuse is harassment that happens over the internet. It may be sending an inappropriate text message to someone that caused them to feel unhappy or unsafe. Supplementary to this, Dr. Karae added the four platforms where online abuse can occur. These are namely: use of internet, social media, online gaming and mobile device. He went on to highlight that a majority of reported cases happen over social media.Another question was “What are some forms of sexual abuse that happen online?” Mrs. Bule said “On average the Vanuatu Women’s Center sees 2 to 4 online abuse related cases per month, particularly during the lockdown period. An example of online sexual abuse reported was when a couple got separated or was stranded overseas or on another island in Vanuatu because of travel restrictions. And when the partner requests for money, the other partner will request that he/she performs sexual activities online before the transaction takes place.”Overall the panelists spoke on some of the impacts online abuse can have on an individual, they also provided practical ways on how parents can help keep their children safe online, who are typically targeted for online abuse and who are the typical online abusers? The webinar ended with panelists sharing their contacts for when victims need to be referred for professional support and counselling. These are the Vanuatu Women’s Center which can be reached via their toll-free number; 161 and also the Mind Care Clinic via telephone 22512 or VOIP 1081.In closing, the issue of online abuse is an issue that affects our entire country and we can only build safer online spaces when we work together. Peace Corps Vanuatu thank each panelist who contributed to the webinar with their expert advice and also to VBTC for co-hosting this year’s Sexual Assault Awareness Month. It looks forward to collaborating with them in April 2023."

Award winners are not only bringing about change within their communities but will also be inspiring a positive change in island communities across the world.“Well done on this achievement, as there were so many excellent initiatives in this category to select between,” the Jury of panellists for the Island Innovation Awards stated when they applauded the FTAI team.“We are very impressed with the work that you have been doing and are excited to see what you will achieve in the future.”The FTAI (Prodaktif Turism Blong Yumi Initiative) is part of the Vanuatu Sustainable Tourism Strategy (2021-2025) and was successfully developed and piloted in 2021. This was led by Jerry Spooner as the Director of Tourism, and Ms Votausi Mackenzie-Reur as the Vanuatu Agritourism Coordinator, and supported by Kehana Andrews, Senior Agritourism Officer, Norah Rihai agritourism advisor funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Leo Vusilai, Local Cuisine Revival Advisor, and Dr Cherise Addinsall, Agritourism advisor funded by the Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR).Minister James Bule accepted the award on behalf of the Ministry of MTTCNVB and the Food Tourism and Agritourism Initiative team during an awards ceremony which took place on Friday 29th of April at the Island Finance Forum 2022.“This is the first time a Government program in Vanuatu has won a global award,” Minister Bule said.“It’s been a long journey trying to develop and realise the benefits of agritourism in Vanuatu and I would like to express my gratitude for Jerry Spooner and Votausi Mackenzie-Reur’s leadership with the FTAI.“Because of this initiative we now have a clearer understanding of what food tourism and agritourism are and the benefits that they can bring to supporting sustainable livelihoods of our people. I commend the passion and commitment of the FTAI team on the successful delivery and global recognition of this initiative, and I confirm that the Government of the day through the EDF 11 will continue to support the Food Tourism and Agritourism Initiative team going forward.”When approached to announce the news to Spooner he stated with a smile, “It’s great to see Vanuatu now getting global attention being described as leading the way in policies and programs that are supporting sustainable and positive change for the benefit of our communities, our local economy and our environment.“Prior to winning the Island Innovation Award, Vanuatu was also listed in the top 52 places to visit in a changed world, in the New York Times being described as what ‘Bali or Fiji was like 40 years ago, because it has yet to reckon with overdevelopment’. The new approach we have taken in Government policy and programs is showing the direct link between destination appeal and Government policies around climate change, sustainable destination management and community wellbeing”.“Our FTAI has been so important in supporting ambassadors to raise the profile of Vanuatu’s productive sector, cuisine and cultural food and farming heritage both domestically and internationally,” Mrs. Mackenzie Reur stated.“By increasing the pride in our local food and farming systems we can provide better health outcomes for our people, support the livelihoods in our rural areas and raise the profile of Vanuatu’s cuisine internationally to make our cuisine an attraction in its own right. The FTAI team have worked tirelessly and dealt with endless challenges that are so common in Vanuatu, yet we have persevered because we are driven by the same passion to create positive change for our people and our islands and we appreciate the leadership we had with the former Director of Tourism, Mr Spooner.”Leonid Vusilai, local Cuisine Advisor stated their research has shown that our food has not been a drawcard for visitors coming to Vanuatu.“Our chefs are working hard to restore pride in our food culture, and through the FTAI we are supporting our agritourism operators to be ambassadors for our local and traditional cuisine,” he said.Norah Rihai, Agritourism Advisor stated, “Through our Vanuatu Sustainable Tourism Policy and Strategy we seek to ensure tourism genuinely contributes to the sustainable livelihoods of our people and communities.By supporting food tourism and agritourism experiences we can improve the wellbeing of our people based on our core values of land, custom, culture, family, community, food, and enable visitors to have meaningful connection to our values”.Senior Agritourism Officer Ms Kehana Andrews stated, “I’ve been working closely with our Food Tourism and Agritourism ambassadors from our program rollout in 2021 throughout the 6 provinces and I’m so impressed with the positive mindset they have and supporting environment they have developed through their Agritourism Association.”A TAFEA Agritourism Ambassador and President of the Vanuatu Agritourism Association, Benson Samuels stated, “I’ve always had so many ideas but wasn’t sure where to start and how to develop them further, being part of the Vanuatu Agritourism Association and going through all the training has given me the tools to develop my agritourism experience and support others in the association to developed theirs.The Vanuatu Agritourism Association is not only providing a supporting network within Vanuatu it’s also linked us up with other regional countries and now we are getting global exposure”.A SANMA Agritourism ambassador, Ina Wells, stated, “Our group of Food Tourism and Agritourism Ambassadors are walking the talk, we are on the ground making these changes in our businesses and communities despite all the challenges we are faced with. We can only give our deepest gratitude to Mr Spooner for his vision and especially EDF 11 for funding this initiative. I also know I speak on behalf of all the ambassadors when I say a special thank you to FTAI team whose perseverance is second to none.You all stood up for us, empowered us and never made us feel like victims, we can only salute you for your steadfast commitment to positive change for Vanuatu. May God richly bless you all”.Dr Cherise Addinsall — agritourism advisor supported by the Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR) – stated, “Vanuatu’s approach to Agritourism through the FTAI is helping to communicate to development partners a clear pathway for agritourism development while supporting agritourism operators to further develop their products to meet tourists’ expectations and support more local meaningful involvement in tourism.As part of the work we are doing through ACIAR we are supporting the establishment, strengthening and capacity building of Agritourism Associations in Fiji and Vanuatu to provide locally led platforms for agritourism operators to advocate and connect to Government and donors and we are particularly impressed with the progress from the Vanuatu Government in both policy and implementation to support food tourism and agritourism experiences and I commend Vanuatu for being so innovative in this new approach”.Mrs Mackenzie-Reur thanked the Vanuatu Government through the European Development Fund (EDF 11), the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Vanuatu Tourism Support Program, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR), the Global Environmental Fund 5 Integrated Sustainable Land and Coastal Management Project, Secretariat of the South Pacific (SPC), South Pacific Tourism Organisation (SPTO), the SANMA Island Food Revolution, Vanuatu Tourism Office and Vanuatu Skills Partnership for supporting the piloting of this incredible initiative, and lastly for all the relevant line Agencies within the Agritourism Value Chain for supporting the Initiative through the National Agritourism Committee and the Agritourism Ambassadors from the Vanuatu Agritourism Association."

These flights are now ready for travellers to book online, through our Sales offices or preferred Travel Agent.“We are ready to go and have worked diligently with the Vanuatu Government and local tourism organisations to ensure that Vanuatu is reconnected to the world in an ambitious and effective way,” says Air Vanuatu Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Atu Finau.“We know how important it is to re commence regular services and are totally committed to making this effective, safe and straight forward for our customers. We understand that the hotels and tourism industry businesses need to be confident that there will be a reliable service and we take this very seriously, despite these challenging COVID-19 times.”While the addition of the regular direct schedule to Melbourne and the new Pacific connection to Tuvalu will be very welcomed, there have also been some difficult decisions taken. In particular, the direct flight from Brisbane to Santo which has not yet been included in the new international schedule.The airline confirmed that discussions are progressing on how to best connect Santo in the future.In the meantime, Air Vanuatu has ensured that the incoming Brisbane flight connects well with the domestic service up to Santo to continue to offer a same day service to Santo.Air Vanuatu assured that every effort will be made to ensure that outer islands receive all the focus possible, however, to begin with and to ensure operations are commercially viable, the international port will be Port Vila for the start of the tourism relaunch. This will be supported by the domestic flights that connect travellers when it is safe and viable to do so, to the outer islands.Air Vanuatu is working with the relevant authorities to secure approval to increase our fortnightly services to a weekly service to Tuvalu is in line with the strategy to support Pacific connections which is a new focus for Air Vanuatu.The Tuvalu connection allows travellers to come internationally to Vanuatu, Tuvalu and onward to Fiji and Australia on connections that are practical and cost effective.It also enables cargo movements that support the revenue and feasibility of these flights and provide important trade connections.“Our immediate focus is also the repatriation of citizens and residents,” Finau confirmed.For repatriation flights to meet the rules set by the Vanuatu Government for safe COVID-19 operations, the government mandates Air Vanuatu to a maximum of 100 passengers per repatriation flight at present."

Border closure and strict entry protocols were effective in keeping the virus out from the country, and the high vaccination rate has helped prevent illness and keep death rates low.The government initially announced that the border would reopen to international travelers by March this year, subject to a high vaccination rate. The vaccination target was not met, thus the plan was postponed to July 1, 2022.Upgrades were also made to the Vila Central Hospital to ensure the continuation of care and support for COVID-19 patients.As of June 19, 83% of the adult eligible population have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccines and 75% are fully vaccinated. 16.8 % have not been vaccinated and 7.4% are partially vaccinated.To date, 11,174 confirmed cases have been reported in Vanuatu, with 195 active cases and 10,963 recovered cases. The number of deaths remains at 14.International visitors will be able to return to the country, by both air and sea, in a few days. Cruise ships can now enter Vanuatu waters without restrictions.None of the tourists or travellers will be required to be fully vaccinated although it is strongly encouraged. They will still need to show proof of vaccination.Travellers will travel to Vanuatu without needing to quarantine. This has already been effective since June 14, as part of the soft border reopening. The travel approval process will be simplified from July 1, according to the Ministry of Health.The Daily Post has been informed that the Vanuatu Tourism Office (VTO) is arranging a small welcome event for the passengers arriving on the first flights this Friday, to mark the border reopening.Prime Minister (PM), Bob Loughman, who is returning back from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Rwanda, Africa, that day is expected to give a short official statement at a small event at the VIP Lounge."

AVL shares the same enthusiasm and our team have been working tirelessly to ensure our airports infrastructure are up to standard with all COVID-travel requirements and customer experience.”The country will still have some entry requirements in place to ensure that both visitors and locals alike are kept safe when travelling within its islands.These requirements will include being fully vaccinated, pre-departure tests and undertaking a health clearance ahead of departure, as well as arrival testing.The local industry is currently preparing for the arrival of international travellers by refreshing and finalising new product, liaising with Australian and New Zealand wholesalers to showcase their products, re-hiring staff and ensuring their hotels and restaurants comply with the Safe Business Operation (SBO) guidelines, a programme which covers trainings and audit checks to ensure enhanced cleaning, personal hygiene, and protection measures are in place to combat the spread of COVID-19.“We’re so excited to be welcoming our international travellers back to Mangoes Resort,” Michelle Clements, Managing Director of Mangoes Resort and Restaurant in Port Vila said.“We’ve spent the last two years working tirelessly to update and refresh the resort and we can’t wait to show the beauty of Vanuatu once again.”Flights are available to book from today, with Air Vanuatu resuming its services with six non-stop flights from Sydney, one direct service a week from Melbourne, and three non-stop flights a week from Brisbane to Port Vila, two weekly services from Auckland and three services a week from Noumea, with onward connections to 27 destinations within Vanuatu.The VTO will keep consumers updated with key milestones and updates to the border reopening."

59,https://vbr.vu/news/would-you-buy-a-property-online/,2022-04-30 00:31:00,Would you buy a property online?,"Countries all around the world have been turned upside down by COVID-19 related restrictions and lockdowns over the past two years. Vanuatu is currently experiencing what many countries have gone through since early 2020. However, while countless businesses have closed or been crippled, and millions of jobs have been lost, the buying online sector around the world has been booming.Suppliers of everything from food to clothing to tech gadgets and other relatively low cost products have seen business rocketing in countries where quarantine, isolation and lockdowns have been a feature of daily life. Even where these restrictions have now been lifted, the habit of buying online is continuing, including for real estate.But would you buy a property online, “sight unseen”?Daily Post spoke with Alexander de Groot from Island Property who has several clients, who have already answered “Yes!” to that question.In Australia, over the last two years, online inspections and virtual auctions were commonplace.“For many people, buying a property is the single biggest purchase they will ever make,” says Alexander. “Yet, their decision to buy or not is often made after only one visit to the property, and sometimes after only a few minutes inspecting the property.“At Island Property we keep an eye on the latest developments in technology that could prove useful to us in representing a property as best we can. One of these advances is in the field of virtual reality, creating the possibility for us to make a virtual tour of a property which allows any interested buyer to go back for as many virtual “visits” of the property as they care to, in their own time.“You can’t simply send a property back the way you can with a dress or a pair of shoes that don’t fit well! So this technology means we can provide a comprehensive view of the property to interested buyers, to help ensure they make the right decision for themselves, even if that decision ends up to not proceed with the purchase.“Using our 360 degree camera we have been creating Virtual Tours – much more than a simple walk through with a mobile phone, but a proper virtual inspection of the interior of the property, as if you were actually walking through the rooms yourself. The Virtual Tour is a one on one digital copy of the physical property — what you see is what you get.“The developers of the 3D external modelling we are using, which is normally used by engineers and surveyors, have told us we are the first real estate business they know of anywhere in the world to apply this 3D modelling of properties for the purpose of advertising and selling.“Providing these 3D external tours to our clients, using drone technology, allows buyers to have a birds eye view at different heights and details of the full exterior and surrounding area of any property or parcel of land.”Alexander continued, “There are many new and exciting changes coming to real estate which we will be implementing as soon as they are viable, but one thing is for sure, the traditional work of the typical real estate agent is going to change significantly in the years to come.“Real estate listings and sales of the future will happen via your phone or from behind a computer whereby the buyer will have full access to all information and digital access to a property before making that decisive visit and purchase.Alexander finished jokingly by saying that, “In a way, if we do our job well, you will see a lot less of us, which for many people who don’t care too much for real estate agents, that could be another big plus!“I invite you to visit our web site www.islandproperty.com to see a glimpse of the future of real estate marketing for yourself.”"
60,https://vbr.vu/news/the-tourism-industry-still-getting-back-on-its-feet/,2022-08-02 00:03:00,The Tourism Industry still getting back on its feet,"By Josepheen Tarianga.In March of 2020, Vanuatu closed its borders to visitors as the pandemic raged outside of the Archipelago. Vanuatu shut itself away from the world for over 2 years and was described by the Guardian to be one of the last Covid hermit nations to open up to International tourists again. The borders opened up on the 1st of July but the country’s tourism industry still appears to be getting on its feet. Many resorts, hotels, and tourism businesses have shared their experiences with the Vanuatu Business Review with the arrival of the first wave of international tourists since the borders opened.Vanuatu’s economy greatly relies on its tourism industry. Before the Pandemic, the direct and indirect contributions of tourism in Vanuatu of VT46.8 billion accounted for 48% of the country’s Gross domestic production (GDP) as shown by World Bank data from 2016 to 2018. Additionally in 2019, with over 135,000 cruise ship arrivals in the country, another VT2.1 billion was injected into the country’s economy.With this reliance, once COVID-19 ravaged the world, Vanuatu’s tourism industry and therefore its economy was greatly affected.According to the National Tourism Business Impacts Survey for TC Harold and COVID-19 Pandemic, there was a 70% fall in full-time employment and a fall of 33% in part-time employment in the tourism sector. 1,633 employees had been placed on unpaid leave because of the Pandemic, 462 on paid leave and 300 employees had been terminated.With the drop in employment opportunities in the country, many skilled workers left the country seekingemployment under seasonal work programs. This resulted in a shortage of skilled workers in the tourism industry being one of the challenges that Vanuatu confronted before the borders opened. Efforts were made to allow the soft opening on July the 1st On Friday the 8th of April 2022, Vanuatu Prime Minister Bob Loughman, announced July the 1st as the set date for the border reopening. This catalyzed the country to make the necessary changes to accommodate the international tourists that the soft opening of the country’s border would bring.The Ministry of Health mobilized to increase the vaccination rates across the country by a staggering amount. On January the 23rd of 2022 only 65% of the population had received at least one dose of the vaccine, only 184,045 doses were administered. The latest update of vaccination rates on July the 3rd showed that 83% of the country’s population had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 246,436 doses were administered to over 220,125 people surpassing the COVID-19 Taskforce’s midyear goal for vaccinations within the country. The Vanuatu Tourism Office (VTO) worked with the tourism sector, different ministries, and partners to getVanuatu Tourist-ready. VTO established protocols for safe border opening and joined a coalition to help combat the shortage of labor in the tourism and hospitality sector that worked to help register and train Ni-Vanuatu into the tourism and hospitality sector. The VTO also made huge efforts in advertising and marketing the country as a tourist destination in anticipation of the borders reopening. All businesses in operation were made to develop a Standard Business operation to allow COVID safeoperations for all businesses. Additionally, the country loosened its COVID-19 safety protocols almost completely. Quarantine was made no longer mandatory, no travel caps on arrival, no pre-registration and pre-travel approval required, and post-arrival covid tests were done away with.In collecting the experiences of different hotels and resorts throughout Port Vila, several establishments were contacted to contribute the information compiled here.After 2 years of being closed, The Ramada Resort by Wyndham recorded 224 room arrivals from the 1st of July to the 14th of July.The Interim General Manager (GM) of Ramada, Frederick Maclean stated that Ramada was pleased to work as an international resort again and the overall guests that stayed at Ramada were happy to be able to travel again and to visit the country as for some it was returned visits to the country. “There was a certain disappointment from visitors as many operators are not back in line and they found that they could not do as many activities as they would have liked” stated Maclean. “Whilst we kept some of our staff, we are now able to re-employ people in all departments and this is very important for us to help assist staff and theirfamilies.”Nasama Resort also reported pleased tourists that had stayed at the resort. On July 16th Nasama recorded 14 rooms with international tourists.“We are very happy that the borders have reopened; however we think there needs to be more of a push in marketing Vanuatu. There are still reports of travel agents telling customers that Vanuatu’s borders are closed and there are no flights” shared Sarah Vogelsberger, the Nasama Resort Manager.The Havannah opened in July with a 50% occupancy rate, a pleasing result as it provided the Havannah Team an opportunity to work back into a comfortable environment said Greg Pechan, the Owner of The Havannah.“It has had a very positive experience with the first tourists that have arrived since the opening of borders. Everyone we have hosted enjoyed their stay; many have stated their willingness to return for another stay in the future. “The adverse economic and social impact of the prolonged closure of borders were set to create seriousissues for our country. The safe reopening of borders has put the country back on a road to recovery,”said Mr. Pechan.However, Mr. Pechan flags Airline connectivity to still be an issue.“We are hoping that increased flight services are not too far away, but understand this could be challenging.”There is a shared belief among the resorts and hotels that as more and more tourists flock back into the country more business activity will return and the tourism industry will improve as there is a present demand for travel to Vanuatu.The Interim GM for Ramada, Mr. Maclean said;“We believe that we will see a strong increase of tourists in the next 6 months, as we are getting more flights into the country from [ Air Vanuatu, Fiji Airways, Air Calin] and as this happens, we should start to see other business activities coming back and increased the various offers that we currently have with the soft opening of the borders. Ms. Vogelsberger referenced data on Expedia and Bookings.com that shows a demand increase for travel to Vanuatu by 12% in the past few weeks.“We are hoping that demand increases and the bookings start to increase. We have been receiving steady numbers of bookings coming in but occupancy throughout the year remains low” she said.Mr. Pechan emphasized the “pent-up demand” for people in Australia and New Zealand to travel as he stated that Traveller research sentiment showed that people are wanting to travel outside borders, internationally but are not keen on long-haul destinations. “The Pacific has therefore become a key destination for Australians, New Caledonia, and New Zealand visitors with Vanuatu ideally placed as a destination of real attractiveness. Bookings moving forward are looking solid” he said. The demand for consumers’ desire to travel was also made apparent by the engagement from a global social post that VTO had made announcing border opening. The post had reached 95,000 people by the 15th of April organically, it was liked (and loved) by 675 people, 172 comments, and over 90 shares.Despite the experiences that hotels and resorts attest to having had with the first wave of tourists, the experiences that truly matter when it comes to Vanuatu’s tourism industry is that of the tourists.There have been many reviews following the first few weeks of tourists back in the country. While many have praised the experience, environment, and services they received from different hotels and resorts others did not have such great things to say.On Trip advisors, a review dated July the 26th from a stay at the Nasama resort on the 16th of July praised the staff of the resort and its facilities as well as the well-maintained state of the resort and its well-kept grounds. Another review of the resort. Two other reviews of Nasama posted to Trip Advisor on July 10th and July the 13th used the word “Paradise” to describe their stay at the resort.Havanah received a similar review on Trip Advisor dated July 16th from a recent stay at the Havanah that applauded Havanah as a honeymoon destination that did not disappoint. On Bookings.com, Ramada resort By Wyndham Port Vila ranked fairly well at 8.1. Guests that stayed at the resort after the borders had opened all had good things to say about the friendly staff and the clean and comfortable environment of the resort. However, the reviews did flag that the resort” Is not quite up to speed yet” and many guests expressed issues with the food.The Holiday Inn Vanuatu received two Trip Advisor reviews that made wonderful mentions of the staff of the resort. One of the reviews dated July 19 was well detailed and honest. It raised concerns such as that things were not as adversities upon arrival at the resort and some places within the country areyet to be in operation. “From conversations with various locals, it appears the Holiday Inn is in a better situation than some other well-known resorts who were not ready to open to tourists, albeit there is still a lot of work to be done at this resort” was mentioned in the review.The other review dated July 16th credited the number of family activities that Holiday Inn offered, theentertainment, Housekeeping, and availability of transportation but the review made a note of the food being tasteless and overpriced.Warwick Le Lagon received what seems to be the most negative reviews among the hotels and resorts as the guests that have arrived in the few weeks that the borders have openedexpressed many issues with their stay at Le Lagon.A review posted to Expedia on July 17th of 2022 stated that the resort had been grossly neglected during the 2 years and was in no condition to open with the state of its gardens, the condition of its facilities, and the high prices it maintains.On Trip Advisor, two reviews wrote on July 14th and July the 6th of 2022 simply stated that Le Lagon was not ready for guests and went on to state why.These reviews reflect on the current state of the country’s tourism industry as guests hold Vanuatu’s Hotels and Resorts to the standards they were at before the Pandemic.The businesses that depend on tourism to operate had taken a direct hit from the border closures. Where many had closed up shop during the 2 years, others remained open in support of the local tourism campaign encouraging domestic consumers to tour Vanuatu and some closed permanently underthe Pandemic’s pressures.Now that the borers have opened, tourism support businesses are dusting themselves off and expect more business once the entire industry has fully woken from its years of slumber.The first month of border reopening has been encouraging for Vanuatu Ecotours.July and December are traditionally the busiest months for our day tours on Efate said Rob Macalister, The Managing Director of Vanuatu Ecotours.“In July 2022 we operated day tours at approximately 40% of what we operated in July 2019. The majority of these bookings were from tour desks, OTAs, and direct bookings. There were very few day tour bookings from wholesale partners in July 2022, but bookings from these wholesalers are strong from August onwards, which is a positive sign” expressed Mr. Macalister.“The biggest problem identified by Vanuatu Ecotours is the poor state of tourism infrastructure. Despitepromises made during the pandemic, the Vanuatu Government has yet to provide any financial support to tour operators through the Tourism Business Support Program, to help them build back infrastructure” Vanuatu Ecotours recorded a healthy demand for outer island packages and outer island experiences with several packages and charters sold, the first of which will operate in August. “These trends are consistent with the forecasts for post-pandemic tourism, where clients are looking for ‘bucket-list’ experiences and are prepared to spend more on their first overseas holiday after 2.5 years,” said Mr. Macalister.The Ecotours Managing director expressed his disappointment because there are signs that tourismin Vanuatu will have strong demand post-pandemic, but there is yet to be support, from the Government to help tourism businesses get their products and infrastructure back to the required standard.Mr. Macalister also cited Air Vanuatu and the unreliability of their outer island services to be a major problem given the international demand for outer island tourism.“We can only hope that Air Vanuatu gets its act together very quickly,” said Mr. Macalister.The lack of Government support for tourism support businesses was also raised by Vila Hope Tours.Vila Hope tours have serviced around 36 visitors since the borders have opened, the operator of the tours advised that while business for him is good, the number of tourists in the country is still low and tour operators that own a fleet of buses would be likely to make a loss rather than a gain if they were to be operational at present.“It has been difficult since tour operators cannot place their brochures at hotels and resorts because those brochures advertise many sites that have yet to open. I have guests that want to visit sites but are disappointed because the sites are still not operational” said the Vila hope Tours operator.“For the sites that are open, many are run down and charge way too high. Evergreen waterfalls has facilities that have not been maintained, slippery paths are overgrown but the costs charged are VT2,000 per tourist. Visitors have expressed their disappointments.”The operator stated that there is a lot to fix up before Vanuatu welcomes more people back and that the VTO should have mobilized to do thorough inspections before the borders had opened;“There was so much money spent on marketing and advertising but not enough money spent by the Government to help tourism businesses and operators get their resources and facilities back up to standard before the borders opened.” Elvis Lite is among the many Handicraft Mamas that have returned to the handicraft markets in anticipation to sell her locally crafted products but she found that while business is good, it is yet to return to what it was before the pandemic.“Tourists have returned but the Pandemic has been hard on everyone and they do not buy as much as they used to but we have just opened, that will change,” said Elvis.Margaret and Ruth stated that during the Pandemic, they were among the women that shut away their crafts and closed up the Handicraft market when the borders closed and had only returned to the Market in June to prepare for the border reopening.“That 2-year period had given us time to craft and create so now the Handicraft market only sells local-made products. Before, we also sold Chinese-made souvenirs but we do not need to anymore” said Mrs. Ruth.“We understand that business is still returning to normal. Once the cruise ships start returning in September, we will stand to earn a lot more.Vanuatu has had 2 years to prepare for the borders reopening and where some have worked diligently to ensure standards and quality are maintained once that period was up, others have not. It is a widely shared sentiment among hotels, resorts, and tourists that have visited since the borders have reopened and support tourism businesses that there is room for improvement as there is much left to fix and make ready.While the country has made great efforts in advertising its readiness, the proof is in the pudding, while some businesses have strived to retain quality, others have yet to re-establish themselves as what they were prior to the pandemic. Visitors had high hopes for the country’s tourism industry that were not met.As the borders have just opened there is still no normalcy in the operations of tourism industry-based businesses but the industry is highly optimistic that there is only up to go from here as it works to improve itself and welcome more tourists in the coming months."
61,https://vbr.vu/news/business-establishment-census-pilot-starts-on-monday/,2022-06-25 22:03:00,Business Establishment Census Pilot starts on Monday,"The Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VNSO) has completed a training of field workers for the Business Establishment Census (BEC) pilot.Consequently, Government Statistician, Mr. Benuel Lenge, has confirmed the census pilot fieldwork will be conducted over the period of four weeks beginning next Monday, 27th of June.There will be two teams in the field for piloting the census, with one working in SANMA Province and the other in SHEFA Province.Each team will pilot the census in both urban and rural settings in order to test the questionnaire and data collection methodology, among other things. The pilot will indicate readiness for the full census to commence later in the year.The two pilot teams will be working in selected areas over the next four weeks, from the 27th of June to 22nd of July.These include SANMA Rural (South East Santo, Canal Fanafo, East Santo, East Malo, and West Malo Area Councils), Luganville (East and West Municipal Wards), SHEFA Rural (Tanvasoko and Vermali Area Councils) and Port Vila (Central Ward).The VNSO is appealing to the general public as a whole, and especially business owners in the above areas to please be aware that BEC teams will be working in their areas over the next four weeks, and to cooperate with the teams should their business be selected for an interview.The Pilot BEC will provide vital information that will be use to aid the actual fieldwork of the census.Before the actual census, the Pilot census is conducted since it is very important to test the questionnaire of the census.This is to make sure the wording of the questionnaire does make sense, and if there are any errors that needs to be spotted.It also includes the lay out of the questionnaire and the logic links for each question.It tests the methodology behind the questionnaire, the links, the context and the nature of the questionnaire.The pilot also trials the preparedness of the logistical arrangements with regards to the networks done with Area Administrators, and Area Secretaries. The exercise will also help identify challenges the teams will face. This will later help the team to better manage risks in the actual census.This pilot will also help the team to find out how much effort is needed for the actual census undertaking.The VNSO is also taking this opportunity to remind all business holders that information provided to a trained interviewer is treated as confidential and prohibited by law to be disclosed.According to the Statistics Act of 2022 any person employed by the VNSO that knowingly discloses any information relating to any person is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding VT2, 000,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both.“We take this very seriously and all the trained interviewers have signed the secrecy agreement,” Mr. Lenge stated.“It is important for the public and businesses to be aware of this data collection initiative, its intended purpose, and to participate in the survey if their business is selected for interview.“The VNSO would like to thank the business owners in advance for your support as we commence this important undertaking.”"

It works with both men and women to recognise and legitimise women in leadership, stated Wilson Toa, the Country Manager for Balance of Power.“‘Through the Lens’ is our main activity, it is a documentary series in which we will follow the stories of ten women in Vanuatu. We have already launched two films and this is the third,” said Mr. Toa.Mrs. Aru expressed at the launching that the film was dear to her as it is dedicated to her mother, who took part in the making of the film but has since passed.The film was put together by local creators, with Francis Malcolm Wai as the head creator. It tells the story of Aru’s upbringing, her life challenges and her strong role as the CEO of VTO during the pandemic.“A lot of times in Vanuatu we look at our leaders and think they had an easy life to get where they are, working with CEO Aru we really got to see that for a lot of leaders, it was not easy. We are glad to tell her story,” says Mr. Wai.“We want this story to inspire young girls and mothers in communities to strive for their dreams.”“Mrs. Aru’s story has the power to make a change in the community,” stated Heidi Bootle, the Australian High Commissioner to Vanuatu.“She is a strong leader.

65,https://vbr.vu/news/musicians-dream-now-a-reality/,2022-06-22 22:28:00,Musicians’ Dream Now A Reality,"By Jason Abel.Minister of Trades, Tourism, Commerce and Ni-Vanuatu Business (MTTCNVB), James Bule, officially launched Vanuatu’s first ever National Music Policy at the Ministry’s compound yesterday.Since Independence, there has never been a music policy in place to protect all musicians and music created in the country, thus yesterday’s launching was a milestone for the music industry.There are three goals within the policy, which will guide musicians in Vanuatu when contributing to the local, regional and international market. Goal one is governance and structure. This seeks to guide and regulate all players in the music industry through equitable governance and structure reform.The second goal is growing the industry. This aims to enhance and develop the music industry in Vanuatu through materials and financial support. The third goal is protecting music in Vanuatu, and that is to provide accurate and timely advice to musicians on their rights and to protect Vanuatu musicians and music from exploitation.In his address, Minister Bule acknowledged the current government for realizing the importance of the music industry through social and economic life of citizens in Vanuatu, and enabling the Council of Ministers (COM) to approve for the Department of Industry to develop this national policy.Mr. Bule said that through the policy, the government has recognized that the music industry is vital to economic growth, including the lives of citizens as well. He also acknowledged all musicians and the music taskforce, Yumi Music Association and other music associations for their support in developing this policy.He further acknowledged those who have preserved the country’s identity through music, which is traditionally evident.“Since Independence, the music industry has been operating within the informal sector., the Government did not recognise music as a formal sector which contributes to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP),” said Minister Bule.“The government now recognises music as a commodity in which the full population in the country consumes it and has formed part of our cultural heritage. As Minister responsible, I look forward in making sure the policy is implemented with the three goals achieved.The MTTCNVB Acting Director General, Mr. Jimmy Rantes welcomed the launching and stated that it is a dream for musicians from past to present.“Today, we formalise the music industry specifically to better organise governance and management of the industry,” he said. “At the same time, the government can better monitor music data and assist our musicians.“The ministry will be here as the lead agency to provide financial support towards the implementation of the policy.”The Acting Director of the Department of Industry (DOI), Mr. Noel Kalo commented that the launching is an achievement for the music industry.“The launching has enabled government to give recognition to the music industry. It is a milestone for musicians, producers, sound engineering including studios,” he said.“Today, the government the has classified music as a commodity alongside kava and other necessities which is accessible every day. The launching is a way forward.“With the music industry now a formal sector, it is a requirement for players to pay tax to the government. The next step is to address the music chain.”Mr. Jean Pierre Sam, representative of the Vanuatu Intellectual Property Office and the committee who drafted the policy, said the DOI finalized the policy and provided it to the COM.“The COM has authorised the DOI to mandate and implement the policy. The next step is to form a Vanuatu Music Council, which will be the country’s music authority. It will take the lead in implementing the policy led by the DOI’s creative sector,” said Mr. Sam.“Musicians from past to present, today is an achievement and a result of unity. I would like to acknowledge the government’s support. This also offers hope for future musicians.”Musician representative, Stan Antas, stated that the policy will guide music development in country.“This will guide the government in targeting national interest,” he said. “It will guide music education, production and trades domestically and internationally. This achievement is the answer to a longtime cry for musicians in Vanuatu.“The launching will also provide employment. A lot of work is yet to be done, however, today’s launching is the first step forward. With the government’s assistance, it will definitely develop the music industry in country.”The MTTCNVB is encouraging all players within the music industry to come forward and work with them in implementing the policies in place.A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was also signed yesterday by the DOI, the Vanuatu Institute of Technology (VIT) and VanIPO to address creativity and innovation in the country.Furthermore, Acting DOI Director Noel handed over Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to three studios that have been assisting musicians."
66,https://vbr.vu/news/world-bank-approves-vt1-18b-for-vanuatus-recovery-and-resilience-boost/,2022-06-24 21:42:00,World Bank approves VT1.18B for Vanuatu’s recovery and resilience boost,"The World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors has approved US$10 million (VT1.18 billion) to support Vanuatu’s ongoing efforts to strengthen climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, health management and debt transparency.This was relayed via a statement released by the World Bank yesterday afternoon.Building on a reform program that began in 2020 – designed to support the implementation of stronger risk mitigation and prevention actions across the country – the Vanuatu Second Disaster Risk management Development Policy Grant with a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option supports key aspects of Vanuatu’s new Disaster Recovery and Resilience Act and its Physical Planning Act. Together these will help improve risk reduction, preparedness, response and recovery from future disasters, which often disproportionally impact vulnerable ni-Vanuatu communities.The operation will also strengthen the health sector response to disasters and climate change, and improve debt transparency through the publishing of quarterly debt reports online.Vanuatu is particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones, floods, droughts, volcanic hazards, earthquakes and tsunamis, and modelling suggests that the country is facing an average of US$48 million per year in risk to assets from earthquakes and cyclones alone. In 2020, Cyclone Harold caused US$617 million (61% of GDP) in economic impacts, only five years after Cyclone Pam caused a similar level of economic damage, and just before the country’s tourism industry – representing a significant percentage of GDP – was effectively halted due to pandemic-related border closures.“We know that women and girls often bear the brunt of disaster impacts in poorer households and that their needs can be overlooked – this support will help ensure no Ni-Vanuatu are left behind in preparedness and post-disaster recovery efforts,” noted Annette Leith, World Bank Resident Representative for Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. “Working with the Vanuatu Government, this support will help save lives and build the resilience of Vanuatu’s communities and economy in the years ahead.”“With this World Bank support, we have made substantial progress in legislative reform, including improving our preparedness to recover from major disasters and ensuring that physical planning takes hazards into account,” said Minister of Finance and Economic Management, Johnny Koanapo. “This comprehensive multi-hazard approach is helping us shift our efforts to longer-term preparedness and recovery, which is essential given the increasing impacts of climate change in our region.”Recognizing that the impacts of disasters are not spread equally, even within households, the operation will also concretely close the gender gap in recovery efforts. The new Disaster Recovery and Resilience Act will ensure that, following a disaster, data will be collected and categorized by gender to ensure essential needs are met and support can be delivered where it is needed the most.The operation is funded through the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s fund for the world’s poorest countries.This financing reinforces the World Bank’s commitment to increasing resilience in Vanuatu through the Vanuatu Climate Resilient Transport Project, which is providing critical upgrades to 65 kilometers of the South Santo Road on Espiritu Santo, and the Vanuatu Infrastructure Reconstruction and Improvement Project, which is improving the climate resilience of schools and roads that were impacted by Cyclone Pam."
67,https://vbr.vu/news/vodafone-network-coverage-impeding-communication-in-west-epi/,2023-07-18 03:37:00,Vodafone Network Coverage Impeding Communication in West Epi,"By Ezra ToaraVodafone users in West Epi are facing significant challenges due to inadequate network coverage, hampering their ability to stay connected with loved ones both within the country and overseas.Mrs. Merry Korine Valia, Principal of Yevali Primary School, expressed her concerns about the network’s impact on the school’s operations, particularly in updating information on the Open Vanuatu Education Management Information System (VEMIS). She revealed the lengths she has to go to access a network signal, saying, “When I need to update school information or make calls, I have to go down to the sea to access the network. Most of the time, I even have to cross to Laman Island to get a connection.”The network limitations also pose difficulties for healthcare providers. Midwife Anne Ruth Pakoa, stationed at Vaemali Health Centre, shared her struggles with network connectivity, especially when it comes to arranging referrals for patients in critical condition who require treatment at Vila Central Hospital (VCH). She lamented, “I often have to leave the sick patients inside the room and walk around in search of a spot with network access to negotiate referrals and address other health-related matters.”According to Janet Orah, Area Administrator of Vermali Area Council, the primary issue contributing to the problem is the reliance on solar power generation, resulting in network connectivity being entirely dependent on sunlight. Orah explained, “Vodafone network usually works during daytime hours, starting from around 10am. However, it all depends on the sunlight. Unfortunately, the network gets disconnected again around 2pm.”Orah further elaborated on the limited coverage, stating, “In West Epi, the network is usually run by Digicel, and Vodafone coverage here depends on the sunlight. As one moves to the south, people can access the network of both Vodafone and Digicel because the coverage is much clearer.”The uneven distribution of network coverage exacerbates the challenges faced by Vodafone users in the area.It has a detrimental impact on the daily lives of residents and professionals alike. Efforts to overcome these obstacles, such as exploring alternative power sources or infrastructure improvements, may be necessary to ensure reliable and accessible telecommunications services there."

The company relies on the support of the government and stakeholders to successfully fulfill its mission.Currently, ITL operates international and domestic ports in Port Vila and Santo. While the Port Vila handles international cargo, the company is upgrading an old wharf in Santo to facilitate domestic operations in the Northern Province.However, the funding required for these initiatives poses a hurdle. Attending the conference offers a valuable opportunity for networking with stakeholders and garnering support for the construction of a new domestic wharf in Santo“In addition to our ownership of the modern Port Ifira Ports Development Services in Port Vila, which handles international cargoes, the government operates the Vanuatu Government wharf, catering to tourist boats,” Kalworai explained.Recognising the significance of networking and stakeholder engagement in their pursuits, ITL actively seeks collaboration, engages in discussions with government entities and regional organisations, and addresses funding challenges. Leveraging these connections, the company strives to enhance its operations and contribute to the growth and development of Vanuatu’s domestic market trade and international market."

The RTI Commissioner will be responsible for the dissemination of relevant information to information-hungry members of the public who need information before making decisions about their lives.With assistance from the Provincial Area Administrator, Tamara says he is confident of covering all islands in the Torres Group in one week before returning to Port Vila on July 31.Asked what the main focus on both trips is, Tamara says it will be on the contents of Corruption, Human Rights and the Vanuatu National Constitution. “For instance, we are aware that currently an increasing number of issues are experienced by our seasonal workers in both Australia and New Zealand, due to inter marriages and cultural differences as well as foreign influences that creep in,” Tamara said.“But we need to be reminded of our rights and duties that are highlighted in our National Constitution, which are there to help us live in a society that is respectful of others and enjoyable for everyone.”The Civic Education Officer said while everyone has his and her rights, it is important to note that Rights come with responsibilities and we must recognise that every right has its limit in which it is enjoyed.However, the moment that right is used outside its limit by using obscene language or defaming someone then it breaches this right to freedom of expression as this freedom does not allow anyone to swear at someone or say something false about another person.In addition, the current trend of increasing number of suicides in the country, is going to be raised with young people and school students on the tour. Tamara said one important part of those rights is an individual’s right to life.“Young people and school students must be told that taking your own life is not a solution to an issue, but rather, it is adding a problem on top of an existing one,” he said.“Instead, if you feel that you have an urgent problem that is complicating your way of life; talk to your leader in your community like your chief, pastor, teacher or any individual who stands out in his or her capacity to help you.“But please do not cut short your life by committing suicide because that is not the solution!”In addition, Tamara calls on all responsible leaders to make themselves available to their young people saying perhaps past victims took their own life because there was no one to talk to them when they needed advice most.To conclude, Tamara says that TIV’s past and present programmes throughout the archipelago would not be possible without the generous assistance of its partners especially the Pacific Community (SPC) and Provincial Government leaders."

The airport has a small runway which hinders the delivery of humanitarian aid in times of emergency.A contract agreement was signed yesterday for the Chinese Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) to design and construct the runway extension at a cost of VT7 billion.The contractor will extend the runway from 2000m to 2600m long and 30m to 45m wide, extend the Taxiway from Code C to Code E and extend the Airport’s apron with Code E aircraft stands.CCECC will also construct a new runway shoulder compliant with Code E, a new Taxiway parallel with the existing one, a new Taxiway shoulder, related fence and perimeter road construction due to the extension, drainage construction and Airfield Ground Lighting (AGL) construction.Director General (DG) of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities (MIPU), Johnson Binaru, said since the contract agreement is non-binding, works will commence once funds are secured by the government.Once a formal agreement is signed, works will begin and will take 18 months to complete.Director General (DG) of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MOFEM), Letlet August, as a Director of the Airports Vanuatu Ltd (AVL) Board, said the government’s vision is to upgrade the airports at Lonorore (Pentecost), Motalava, Norsup (Malekula) and Tanna to Category C and the Port Vila and Santo Airports to Code E.The Council of Ministers (COM) has endorsed for the upgrade works to firstly begin at Pekoa Airport, as works are already underway at Norsup, he said.The investment is another government commitment to the aviation sector, said MOFEM Minister, Johnny Koanapo, who put pen to the contract signing yesterday with MIPU Minister, Jay Ngwele and CCECC Director, Ling Qing.He said the government wants to embark on this project from July this year.Minister Ngwele said the project will greatly benefit Vanuatu economically. He stressed that they have a lot of plans for enhancing the country’s infrastructure sector, but the funding is not enough.CCECC Director Ling acknowledged the government for having the company do the design and construction of the Pekoa Airport runway extension. He said CCECC will do its best to implement the project.Member of Parliament (MP) for Santo Constituency, Marco Mahe, and MP for Tanna, Xavier Harry were present during the signing with engineers from MIPU, Finance and MIPU’s DGs and representatives from CCECC."
78,https://vbr.vu/news/the-challenge-to-replace-skilled-tourism-workers/,2022-05-19 23:33:00,The challenge to replace skilled tourism workers,"By Charles Hakwa.As Vanuatu loses more and more of its skilled workers from the tourism industry to seasonal work in Australia and New Zealand, the Government has kickstarted a few initiatives to attract more people to the industry, to help fill in the gap before the border reopening in July.According to the Vanuatu Tourism Office (VTO) staff, these include job placements in the tourism industry, based on their educational backgrounds and an opportunity to support training for a job, particularly for those who are unqualified but interested. Registration for this initiative is currently taking place at the former El Gecko restaurant behind Island Time Café in Port Vila town.Warwick Le Lagon’s General Manager (GM), Ali Serhan, said it is always good to have initiative and support from the government.However, Serhan believes focus should also be on explaining to the young generation how important tourism is for the country.GM Serhan also said it is important for the young people to know the income it generates, and the contribution towards the economy, from employment to trade.Serhan who has been a GM for other Warwick resorts in Lebanon, Jordan and Fiji also believes that Vanuatu needs to raise a generation that loves tourism and understand that improving the tourism sector contributes to the country’s development.Similarly, to other resorts, Le Lagon also lost a lot of their skilled workers to seasonal work. He said the majority of staff they tried to call to return to work are all overseas.The GM admitted bringing in new workers and training them will not be an easy process, given the short timeframe prior to border reopening, however he remains optimistic that they will manage.He believes the country will not be very busy in the first couple of months, and this will give them more time to be 100% ready.Everyone who left the tourism sector for seasonal work overseas probably have one common reason for doing so — better pay.Tourism has contributed a lot to the national economy, before COVID-19 triggered border closures.However, a question one should ask is, “who benefits from this economic income, the hotel and resort owners, the leaders, the country as a whole or just the people who work in the industry?”A former employee from the tourism industry who asked to remain anonymous agreed that tourism generates revenue for the country, but he also believes it is mostly government leaders and the business owners who benefit from this.The former employee from a well-established tourism business said everyday they would always be well groomed and work hard, but at the end of the day, they received very low wages.One of his colleagues who has a family found the salary inadequate, so he decided to travel to Australia to earn more money because working for a minimum wage of VT220/hour was just not good enough, compared to the $25 /hour he was getting in Australia.The former tourism employee is therefore encouraging young people to sign up for seasonal work."

Through this funding from the FDA, France is supporting the Government of Vanuatu in the structuring of its national multilingual University by supporting the development of its infrastructure, training offer, its governance, its human resources, and its technical, digital and pedagogical means. This approach is in line with Objective 2.4 of Vanuatu’s National Sustainable Development Plan 2016-2030 (NSDP), which aims to increase higher education opportunities, including technical and vocational training and skills through a law establishing the National University of Vanuatu (Act No. 34 of 2019 published on 24 January 2020).To carry out its ambitious project, the University must equip itself with the infrastructure and the human and financial resources necessary for its development. It is in this context that the Vanuatu government requested the support of the FDA. A first project was developed for a total of VT372 million (€3 million) to fund the construction of infrastructure, the support for the strengthening of governance and institutional, organizational and human capacities, as well as the development and upgrading of academic programs.The FDA is also financing a project with funds delegated by the European Union, aimed at developing the NUV’s digital infrastructure by acquiring computer equipment (hardware and software), strengthening human capacities and creating a connectivity network within the NUV’s main campus linking it with its peripheral campuses. This project will act as a boosting catalyst in NUV’s digital strategy and development. The University will thus be able to position itself as a key player among regional universities in the Pacific. The accelerated development of the data centre, documentation centre and language centre will provide students with access to resources essential for their learning."

There is also an agreement with VAS and the Department of Agriculture for the Biogas Unit at the Tagabe market.VAS’ Business Development officer, Aaron Prendergast, said the cement slab at Tagabe was installed on Tuesday and the slab at the Central market will be installed this week as well. Following this, two HBG4.0 systems will be installed at each site.“For the main market, the intention is to retrofit some bain-marie food heaters to keep hot food for the food vendors in the markets, along with some biogas for cooking purposes, with potential further biogas systems to be added in the future to cater for all of the cooking needs,” Mr. Prendergast explained.“For the Tagabe market, the Biogas will be used by the food vendors. These vendors currently rely on LPG gas for cooking.“The system will also benefit the markets in being able to process some of the waste from the markets and reducing the need for waste disposal. The third main benefit, in addition to cheap fuel, waste management is the production of a valuable biologically active liquid fertiliser as a by-product.”Mr. Prendergast added that considering all of these economic benefits, it is certainly a viable approach for Vanuatu, and that is before considering the environmental benefits that these systems bring as part of the package.The Biogas units are part of the eight Biogas unit systems, donated as a gift by the Israel Ambassador to the Vanuatu government supported and installed by VAS.VAS confirmed that there are four other units and these will be installed in different provinces, after consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries, Forestry and Biosecurity.Prendergast believes that this is a positive and practical way forward for waste management and renewable energy production, in all markets throughout the country.VAS recently installed Biogas units for Malapoa College and Lycee LAB, Montmartre is listed as the next beneficiary of the project."

In this series I look at different ways in which we can grow and develop our small businesses sustainably.For the last two weeks I explored ways of finding and working with a business coach. Today my focus is on other kinds of business advice.Bank managers or bank business staff are a likely source of advice and support for small businesses. If you can, choose a bank that you feel comfortable with and where the staff have time for you – this is obviously harder in more densely populated urban areas. Remember that many bank staff will never have run a small business so while they will understand the financial requirements, they will not necessarily have the required knowledge and experience to help you with other aspects of the business.The same will also be true for your accountant, if you have one. They will be experts in a range of financial systems but again, it is likely that many have never run their own business. When choosing an accountant look around, write down the skills and knowledge you require them to have and interview them to see if they will be a good fit for you and your business!There are sector-based business associations – business groups based on one industry like tourism or hotel management or retailing or construction. These organisations are very supportive and can help with a detailed knowledge of the industry you are in. They may be limited in their wider knowledge of the local and national economy.In most Pacific countries there are a range of programmes and organisations supported by donor funding and designed to support local business development – some might be sector based (tourism is very popular at the moment as is climate change) and others might be more rural focused. Support from these types of programmes will always depend on meeting specific criteria which might not suit your needs at this time.Chambers of Commerce and Industry exist in all countries and are designed to be a voice for and offer support to the private sector. Usually these are focused in the main cities and towns but some will have provincial outreach. In Fiji the Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation operates with a number of Councils designed to support specific groups such as Women in Business and Young Entrepreneurs. There are also Chambers of Commerce in Fiji. Vanuatu Chamber of commerce and Industry and Solomon Islands Chamber of Commerce and Industry are great sources of help and support. SICCI in the Solomons run good networking events which provide business opportunities for those taking part. For young entrepreneurs in particular, organisations like TYEE in Tonga, V Lab in Vanuatu and YECSI in Solomon Islands are great sources of support, advice, training, coaching and networking.Government departments support small businesses in a variety of ways – go to your relevant ministry (e.g. agriculture, fisheries, tourism, manufacturing etc) or provincial government centre and find out what they can offer.There are organisations that specifically support businesses wishing to export – Pacific Trade and Invest is one Pacific wide organisation. Many countries will have specific organisations offering support and advice to SMEs.Look out for specific events in your area that might offer support to small businesses. At the moment most Governments are making stimulus packages and loans available to small businesses to help get the economy moving.As well as all these agencies and organisations there are informal sources of advice from friends and family and of course from other businesspeople.The important thing to remember is that most advice, except for an independent mentor or coach, comes from a specific point of view or approach – this might be affected by the industry (e.g. finance) or criteria established by donor agencies and government departments. My advice is to listen carefully, always thank the person and then carefully consider all the issues before deciding and taking the advice.If you join a membership organisation like a Chamber of Commerce or Women in Business Group, be prepared to join in – attend meetings and get involved. You will also have things to offer other businesses!Other issues that I will be covering in this series include:• Understanding the help that might exist to support the development of your business• Managing growth and development in a sustainable manner• Choosing the right new products and new markets• Understanding the business economy in which we are operatingIf you have any other suggestions or any questions or comments, please contact me.Breadfruit Consulting (www.breadfruitconsulting.com) is a Vanuatu-based business providing advice, training, coaching, and mentoring to businesses throughout the Pacific islands.

Farmers and interested individuals will have to pay a membership fee of VT5,000 for one year.“Members spending VT1,000 to buy vegetable seedlings will see a deduction of VT100 deposited into their accounts and at the end of each year, members will receive their shares.“Green Coop will be assisting its members also by purchasing their vegetables once harvested.“The establishment of this first greenhouse is a trial and it was successful so plans are in place for future development of this project.“Increasing the production of vegetable seedlings from 100 to 1,000 seed trays monthly is our aim for the coming months.“The Huarere Community still have available space for another greenhouse so due to the high demand of vegetable seedlings, we can build another greenhouse focusing on sowing vegetable seeds to meet the high demand of urban dwellers.”As a singer and entertainer, Mr. Siro, says musicians do not make any revenue during the COVID-19 crisis following the strict health protocols imposed by the Ministry of Health and there is no support from the government.“The only way out to sustain my family’s livelihood is agriculture.“It gives me new life and new hope for tomorrow,” he said.“To wake up daily to see the green vegetables around my house heals my soul, brings good health to the community and also provides income.“We still need technical assistance from the DARD to support us to develop this greenhouse project as it is totally a new direction for my community in terms of maintaining supply of seedlings, quantity and quality of the crops.“We will also need assistance from the Department of Cooperative in regards to training on how to manage a Cooperative and other vital aspects of operating a Cooperative.“I would like to encourage other musicians who are struggling to survive amidst the COVID 19 situation to return to agriculture as it is the only way out to sustain livelihood and to ensure food security at home.”Recently, the DARD’s Vegetable Specialist, Heggar Molisa, visited the greenhouse to see the progress of the project and at the same time, provide some technical advice on areas that needs improvement.Vegetable Specialist, Molisa, says she was impressed to see how farmer Siro has put the skills and knowledge attained from the Vegetable Cultivation Technology training into practice.“The training has provided basic knowledge and skills on how to do vegetable farming,” she said.“The Green Coop greenhouse nursery is one of the first greenhouse established in Port Vila and it is amazing to see how the Huarere Community has managed to implement such project.“Raising vegetable seedlings or managing a vegetable nursery is a huge challenge for many farmers.“Farmers tend to access seedlings for direct transplanting instead of sowing their own seeds.”Molisa mentioned Farmer Siro has used all the skills and techniques required to sow seeds in a nursery and the management practices. This is a positive impact of the training he has attended.“I have noticed that the community also do backyard gardening, making good use of available spaces and resources they have and this is a good way forward in ensuring food security in urban areas,” she said.“A few challenges raised during the visit includes accessing of top soils and upgrade of the greenhouse nursery.”The Vegetable Specialist has assured the community that the DARD will continue to help ensure sustainability of the project.“The DARD’s backyard garden program for this year will support Green Coop with nursery materials to improve their greenhouse and a backyard garden training to improve their skills and knowledge that they already have,” she added.“The Huarere community has taken a step forward to demonstrate their commitment, passion and their interest in backyard gardening and this shows that in the future, the community can implement a bigger project.”"

As such, her certiﬁcate was received by the Acting Director of Industry, Mr. Noel Kalo, on her behalf.VanIPO acknowledged the Ambae string basket is now a popular brand within the handicraft sector, attracting a lot of attention from locals as well as international tourists. It was Woi’s imagination, wisdom, and creative arts of weaving pandanus leaves to produce such a unique handicraft that resulted in the rich traditional art from her area of origin in Ambae.Through the skills partnership program under TVET, and implementation of the Handicraft Sector Action Plan 2018-2020 coordinated by the Department of Industry, community awareness has been conducted throughout Vanuatu’s provinces.Community weavers are encouraged to come forward and register their Intellectual Property rights to protect their creativity within the market. This is the only legal avenue to address the issue of counterfeits within a market.VanIPO noted the handicraft sector is a very big sector which involves a lot of women and girls who come together to weave for various purposes. They play a very important role within the tourism value chain in terms of producing traditional handicrafts as souvenir gifts to tourism. With the border reopening in July, a lot of weavers and handicrafts vendors will get back in business soon."

This is part of the Sea Project Phase 2 being implemented in many islands throughout Vanuatu.Through the whole phases of the project, JICA and VFD have tried to disseminate coastal fisheries resource management methodology in collaboration with the coastal communities.This time, JICA handed over seven units of 7m long FRP boats with Suzuki brand 40 HP outboard engines and two sets of Deep Sea Deck Winch, 50 pcs of 200 L Eskies, 15 units of Solar Power Freezer Units, 140 sets of Bottom Fishing Equipment Sets and 140 sets of Trolling Devices.The total value of the equipment is VT25,000,000.Since 2006, JICA and VFD started the Coastal Resource Management Project and as a result, VFD completed the Community Based Coastal Resource Management (CBCRM) guideline first in the Pacific last year.Under the COVID-19 situation, JICA could not dispatch the Japanese expert to Vanuatu for nearly two years. However, VFD had successfully drafted and completed the CBCRM Guideline with online support from Japanese experts.JICA and VFD already agreed to extend the project until March 2023, and the total cooperation period will be more six years. This means this project is the longest technical cooperation project in Vanuatu.“Even under COVID-19 situation, VFD implemented and completed the CBCRM guideline first in the Pacific,” Resident Representative of JICA Vanuatu Office, Rika Uemura said.“This will be good example for other Pacific countries especially for in Melanesia. JICA wishes to see VFD continuing to support people and community in coastal areas and to maintain marine resource.”Director General of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries and Biosecurity (MALFFB), Moses John AMOS said, “VFD has been keeping long time good relationship with JICA since 2006 and also many VFD staffs had participated JICA Training in Japan.”Uemura added, “JICA could not dispatch Japanese expert for two years. But we understand the Government of Vanuatu had announced that border would be opened from this coming July. JICA would like to take necessary measures to bring Japanese experts to Vanuatu and assist more capacity development of VFD July 2022 onward and also VFD staff travel to Japan for more training.”Three times JICA training participant and Deputy Director of VFD, Sompert Gereva said, “According to JICA, additional equipment will be provided from Japan soon. All the equipment provided by JICA will be distributed soon to all six provinces for the community and people of Vanuatu as VFD’s responsibility.”"

This is what we achieved with the readiness assessment Report back in 2018, and this E-Commerce strategy.”The present strategy is aimed at supporting Vanuatu’s efforts to address e-commerce challenges identified in the last two years and leverage additional resources from the Government and development partners to accelerate e-commerce adoption, increase digital readiness and, in fine, support Vanuatu’s economic transformation. Vanuatu has yet to take advantage of the e-commerce potential.The country could benefit substantially from e-commerce if it is able to accelerate the adoption of key measures aimed at supporting the development of an e-commerce ecosystem (e.g. digital economy strategy, enhanced regulatory framework) and private sector investments (in skills and access to finance).Among other benefits, e-commerce can fuel development of the tourism and professional services sectors, attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and increase employment in Vanuatu, thus limiting the structural brain drain.“Every ship needs crew members to ensure the safe arrival of all passengers,” Minister Bule said.As Minister responsible for the Ministry of Tourism, Trade, Commerce and Ni-Vanuatu Business (MTTCNVB), he also officially appointed the first ever Vanuatu National E-Commerce Committee to ensure the implementation of the Vanuatu National E-Commerce Strategy and Roadmap.The Committee comprises the Directors General (DGs) of the MTTCNVB, Finance, Infrastructure, Agriculture, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Vanuatu Post Limited, Government Chief Information Officer, Directors from the Departments of Customs and Foreign Affairs, Reserve Bank Governor, Telecommunications Radiocommunications and Broadcasting Regulator, General Manager of the Vanuatu Chamber of Commerce, and CEO of the Vanuatu Tourism Office."

Skippers are also finding it difficult to make daily trips from the mainland to Mystery Island or even around the island due to the shortage.Mr. Daniel also revealed that the demand for fuel on the island has increased in recent years, which is one of the reasons for the current shortage. While a few inter-island vessels have visited the island, they can only transport one or two drums of benzene for business individuals.The situation has become so desperate that a local businessman on the island chartered a flight from Tanna to Aneityum just to transport his three drums of benzene earlier this week, highlighting the critical need for the fuel.The island is expecting the arrival of MV Touaraken yesterday, to bring more fuel, especially benzene. According to Mr. Daniel, some businesses and individuals have already booked and paid for these drums of benzene in advance.People have been reminded that they are allowed to buy up to two drums only."

The event is the launching of Enable South Pacific – ESPThe event will cover topics such as the Lease Title, other property documents necessary for the sale and purchase, the role of the Real Estate Agent in the transaction, and the new ESP online portal, which will help both vendors and purchasers. A ni-Vanuatu Sales Agent will be available to assist and answerquestions in Bislama.The ESP portal was created to facilitate online real estate transactions on the internet for both the Waterfront Real Estate agency and the parties involved. By providing online guidance and tools, the aim is to make it easier for a wider range of owners and buyers to access their services, and complete most of the required steps online from their home. The portal collects all the necessary information and documents to comply with the Anti Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing legislation, and to speed up the conveyancing process. The information provided is confidential and disclosed only to the entities and authorities as prescribed by law. Vendors can collect and properly store their property documents online, and purchasers who have subscribed to the ESP portal can access the documents of up to 5 properties they are interested in buying. The portal is connected to the Waterfront Real Estate agency website, and when a buyer finds a property they like, they can identify the property by its ID# on the ESP portal and will have access to the property documents that would normally be available to the public through a search at the Land Records, providedthey have subscribed to the ESP. This is an advantage for purchasers as they can provide their lawyer with most of the relevant property documents to speed up the due diligence and legal advice on the transaction. The ESP portal aims to facilitate and make real estate deals more accessible, especially for people who may feel hesitant about approaching an agency or a lawyer, and to create an online platform that can help streamline the administrative procedures around a real estate transaction, improving efficiency and encouraging proper legal representation.The Principal owner of Waterfront Real Estate and the ESP Portal, advised that it has taken 18 months working with another developer for the portal to be developed and believes it will speed up the closing of a property deal, while ensuring proper legal representation and advice, and allow purchasers to haveaccess to relevant property documents. The objective is to encourage any ni-Vanuatu who may be thinking of selling a property, but is worried about the stress, technicalities, risks, and time involvedin the process, to participate in utilising the portal.

It also highlights the importance of digitising national identification systems, which has been consistently highlighted by global policy-making and institutional finance bodies such as the Asian Development Bank and World Bank Group as one of the building blocks for development.“This report identifies and explains why blockchain technology is the way forward for Vanuatu. At a time where evidence shows access to finance has been contracting, a review of how we do business was critical,” Pacific Advisory’s Managing Director, Glen Craig said.Pacific Island nations that have implemented biometric and digital ID systems have experienced accelerated economic and social development. A strong and accurate national ID system built on automated blockchain technology would increase Vanuatu’s capacity to efficiently deliver government services, facilitate digital payments and a digital economy, and improve citizens’ rights and access to services.The report found that 86.7% of private sector and 100% of public sector respondents indicated that a digital ID is one of the most important factors in achieving regulatory adaptation and eventually integration for widespread adoption of blockchain technology and blockchain finance in Vanuatu.“Blockchain technology takes the doubt out of financial transactions and is particularly suitable to the conditions in the Pacific Islands. Decentralised finance and data management applications can be set up and used at the ministry level to facilitate, track, and more easily account for the delivery of payments across Vanuatu,” Mr. Craig said.The report also provides a roadmap for integrating blockchain technology further into the financial, business, and development landscape in Vanuatu. This includes the adoption of international best practices, the development of a Data Protection and Privacy Act, building capacity via increased financial and fintech literacy, and engaging infrastructure providers.Vanuatu’s Minister for Tourism and Trade, Matai Seremaiah, welcomed the report and emphasised the need to embrace the opportunities that arise from digital transformation in the tourism industry.“As we move towards a digital economy, Vanuatu’s tourism industry must embrace the opportunities that arise from digital transformation. By leveraging technology, we can unlock new trade possibilities, develop market access for our small businesses, and create new avenues for growth and prosperity,” Minister Seremaiah said.He also highlighted the importance of national ownership and political leadership to ensure adoption occurs in a manner that brings resources, better systems, and positive change to the financial sector, business community, and the public at large.The report’s findings are particularly significant given that banking services and staff numbers at outer island branches have declined in recent years, with no viable substitute for financial access provided.Recommendations have the potential to accelerate progress towards economic inclusion, development, and growth, but will require legislative and regulatory reform to perform responsible de-risking and ensure protections are in place for users, businesses, and institutions using blockchain systems and applications.“The report has the potential to change the landscape of financial services in Vanuatu and create new opportunities for economic growth and inclusion,” Mr. Craig said.“By implementing the report’s recommendations, the government of Vanuatu can achieve its goals of creating a more inclusive financial system, with better access to relief during natural disasters and a more attractive investment destination.”"

It took nine months for the engineer to come to Vanuatu.According to Belair Airways, in the midst of the lockdown, they had to wait for the engineer as there was no proper qualified engineer to assist them in Vanuatu. Nonetheless, the company was able to complete its Maintenance Hangar and it is now ready for full operations come next month.Belair has two aircrafts. One is fully functional and ready for service, while the other is getting serviced and should be soaring the skies in August or September this year.CEO Karie has assured the travelling public to expect better flow of services from here onwards.Belair Airways, Chief Pilot Captain Toara Karie, has indicated that more pilots and engineers will be entering Vanuatu from Fiji, New Zealand and Solomon Islands after the border reopening in order to help the shortage of technical people in the country.The number of pilots and engineers that Belair hopes to take on has not yet been finalised."

95,https://vbr.vu/news/government-bond-option-regulation-gazetted/,2023-04-01 08:00:00,Government Bond Option Regulation Gazetted,"Minister of Finance and Economic Management, John Salong, has reiterated that the recently gazetted Investment – Government Bond Option Regulation Order No.44 of 2023 under the Citizenship Act [CAP 112], which allows applicants to apply for Vanuatu citizenship by virtue of a bond investment, is the best deal for Vanuatu.He made the response when contacted by the Vanuatu Daily Post as the Opposition bloc cautioned stakeholders that the latest Investment By Government Bond Options (IGBO) Program lacks comprehensive consideration, and will hit Vanuatu on its foot by potentially causing the loss of government income and indebting the country to up to 90 million Australian dollars in just two to three years.On 27th of March, 2023 the Vanuatu government gazetted the Investment – Government Bond Option Regulation (IGBO) Order No.44 of 2023 under the Citizenship Act [CAP 112].The Opposition noted that this allows any qualified applicant to get a Vanuatu passport through buying government bonds, which is a loan to Vanuatu to be paid back in two to three years time.According to the Order, the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) will issue 500 units of government bonds for this option, ranging from AUD 150,000 to AUD 180,000, depending on the time to maturity:1. For bonds maturing in 2 years — AUD 180,0002. For bonds maturing in 2.5 years — AUD 170,0003. For bonds maturing in 3 years — AUD 150,000Apart from buying the bonds, applicants have to pay an application fee to the Citizenship Commission as follows:4. Single applicant — AUD 20,0005. Couple — AUD 30,0006. Couple and one Child — 45,000 AUD7. Couple and two Children — 60,000 AUDThe Opposition is seriously concerned that this program has not had proper analysis by the Government and whether the Council of Ministers (COM) or Government Caucus was thoroughly briefed on the implication of this program.“It is a variation to the current government donation program, known as Development Support Programme (DSP) and Vanuatu Contribution Program (VCP), where to get their Vanuatu citizenship, clients make a donation and government earns USD 80,000 (AUD 111,000) per single application to USD 130,000 (AUD 181,000) per family of four,” the Opposition stated.“For the same application but through the new program IGBO, government gets much less — AUD 20,000 per single applicant to AUD 60,000 per family of four. Being the cheaper option, government is losing AUD 91,000 per single applicant to AUD 121,000 for a family of four in revenue.“Since 2017, when Vanuatu launched the DSP, it has consistently earned almost 1 billion vatu in government revenue per month or some 12 billion per year, constituting one-third of the national budget.“The Opposition is asking why would the Government jeopardize a revenue Program that’s already earning well and will now turn income into debt?“Compared to DSP, it’s obvious most clients would prefer to buy bonds to get a passport and get their money back in two to three years time, rather than make a non-refundable donation to the Government.”The Opposition is concerned that all ni-Vanuatu who are agents will be affected significantly by this program and is suggesting that instead of creating another new Program to cannibalize DSP, why not focus on it and make it better, perhaps by reducing the donation to sell more cases until EU revokes its current visa free suspension.“Bonds are in reality a loan to the Vanuatu Government and we need to pay this back when it’s due. 500 bonds will equate to approximately AUD 90 million loan which is putting the country at risk if we cannot honor it in two to three years to refund,” the Opposition stated.“There are other significant associated risks to the Government, including foreign exchange fluctuations and the government will be expected to absorb these risks. Were the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) and the Ministry of Finance properly consulted given that under the regulation they will be “responsible to determine the redemption procedures for when the groups of bonds mature?“The Reserve Bank must make its position clear on this matter. Would the Government have the capacity to repay the bonds when they mature? If we have more cyclones or pandemic within two years and cannot reimburse investors, Vanuatu may have to declare bankruptcy or possibly consider other serious revenue options such as implement income tax to help repay this.“IGBO is a loan system and will increase our debt. It is the cheapest bond with the shortest maturity time worldwide and is very dangerous for the country,” the Opposition added. “On the other hand, DSP is better because government earns more and we don’t have to refund donations.”The Opposition is also of the opinion that the provision for only “one” Master Agent is suspicious and unfair, considering DSP is open to many agents who are citizens and are by law subject to VAT compliance. And there is no criteria of appointing a Master Agent.One thing is certain and that it this program will give the Master Agent a competitive edge, and allow him to use this platform to take away business from the 100 or so locally based DSP agents, and with this the Opposition is concerned.“A government bond represents debt that is issued by a government and sold to investors to support government spending, operation or development,” the Opposition stated. “Some government bonds may pay periodic interest payments, however our bonds are at no interest. Bonds cannot escape the endorsement of Parliament whether they be revenue or expenditure component.”In response, Finance Minister Salong said that it is the best deal.“Vanuatu does not have a capital market,” Minister Salong said.“These people are giving the best possible deal, they take the risks and deal with Australian dollars. We even do not have to pay interest.“Vanuatu has a debt policy, and the Government will live by its debt policy. The debt policy does not allow us to borrow what we do not need.“This has already been appropriated — the Budget for the 2023 financial year as announced in the recent First Extraordinary Session of Parliament is VT68,330.7 billion and a VT3.5 billion deficit, so all we need is to finance this deficit, not AUD 90 million.”"

Among them were various leaders, chiefs and their delegates.Members of the public who wish to sign the Pledge are advised to go to the Travel and Information Centre across from Alliance Française in Port Vila to do so.The Nabanga Pledge will be launched in Santo this Friday."

The bakery informs the Daily Post that in the last week it had used up to a containers worth of flour to make bread. While there is flour in stock, there is only enough to last about 2 weeks.Brother Bakery had depleted its flour stock last week Wednesday and are waiting for the next flour shipment, in hopes that Brother’s bread production can start back up by Thursday. “We were told to expect the shipment on Wednesday. For us, this is the third shortage we are experiencing in this year alone,” explained John Shi, the owner of Brother Bakery.“We get flour shipments twice every month. Despite COVID-19, last year’s shipments were good, but since the war in Ukraine started there has been more issues with flour supply.“We ship our flour from Fiji, Fiji sources its wheat from European countries and Ukraine.”"

At this moment we haven’t got the slaughter man available but we will certainly look at that again,” he said.VAL is currently exporting beef to New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.“We’ve got a good reputation through those markets,” Smith said.VAL is the first abattoir in Vanuatu to be HACCP certified.

Green energy is among the solutions being considered.In August 2021, the URA had announced an increase of electricity prices by 1.3%. In September, this price increased by 1.93%. VT53.85kWH in August to VT54.89kWH. The price hike took place in less than a month.In 2022, the hikes continue as March had a VT57.63kWH electricity price that was adjusted upwards by 4.25%. An electricity price of VT60.08kWH for April of 2022.This is a very difficult situation for us to maneuver as it is out of our hands. The price of fuel that is increasing which contributes about 40% to the price of electricity. Even if we did manage to establish a way to lower the cost of electricity, when the fuel prices continue to increase so will the electricity prices, says the Chief Executive officer (CEO) of URA, Paul Kaun.“One of the options we are working on with the Government is promoting the use of green energy.

The onshore facilities will include a public shelter and toilets for passengers, and laydown areas for cargo handling.The award follows a rigorous procurement process that commenced in July 2021, concluding in September 2021. Evaluation of the bids proceeded straight after the bid opening in September.Asian Development Bank (ADB), who are partially funding South Paray construction, approved the Bid Evaluation Report (BER) in December 2021.Following BER approval, recommendations were made for the Government, through VPMU, to commence commercial negotiations with Fletcher, as it became apparent then that the COVID-19 pandemic had grossly impacted pricing, material supply and shipping logistics. The shipping costs and the price of materials, especially of essentials, such as fuel and steel increased exponentially.South Paray domestic wharf has been a key priority project of the Government since 2012 when the Vanuatu Inter-Island Shipping Support Project was negotiated with donor partners. Since works were halted in 2017 due primarily to faulty designs, VPMU and its partners have worked extremely hard to resume the project, not only to resolve the design issues, but also so that the project fits into a budget that guarantees successful completion of the wharf.The current layout differs markedly from the first, but will still see a wharf infrastructure that engineers are adamant, would be fit for purpose, while at the same time, meeting the growing demands of the domestic trade.It is also anticipated that the new wharf will ease concerns over over-crowding and water pollution at the temporary wharf at Pontoon Bay.A signing ceremony is planned to take place this week between Fletcher and the Minister for Infrastructure and Public Utilities.The South Paray wharf is being funded primarily by the ADB and the New Zealand Government under the Vanuatu Inter-Island Shipping Support Project (VISSP) as part of a broader project to deliver other wharf infrastructures in Santo and Malekula.Also included in VISSP are the extensive repairs to the Lenakel and Litzlitz wharves which is almost completed and the soon to be awarded contract for the construction of public shelters and toilets at both facilities."

The first was a series of 30 TikTok videos of women as part of the #BaeYuSaveMekemWanJenis campaign- local women talking about what men can do to make a change when women are facing violence. The second was a series of 18 videos and posters as part of the #RodBloJenis campaign featuring 18 male champions for gender equality calling on men to be part of the ‘journey to change’.The third, concluding project phase consists of the launch of a new website, fully supported by key stakeholders such as the Vanuatu Women’s Centre and the Department of Women’s Affairs, under the longstanding Vanuatu 16 Days Stanap Strong Akensem Violence brand.The Stanap Strong website is designed to become a knowledge hub on ending violence against women and girls. It provides a home for existing and future resources, extending their outreach capacity and amplifying their power.

The most vulnerable group are the older people.“We have seen ICT as the only means whereby nations, governments, organisations, communities, and people stay connected,” the NCC Chairman, Deputy Chief Information Officer at the Office of the Government Chief Information Office (OGCIO) Mr. John Jack said.“It is also an opportunity to create a platform for the community to explore how we can accelerate digital transformation in Vanuatu in this challenging time.”“The National ICT Coordination Committee believes that during the one-day event, participants have a lot to say about Vanuatu’s experience during the COVID-19 restrictions and curfews when the meetings all run to Zoom as an alternative during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in the country.”He added that for past years, ICT has proven that it can and will enable not only a healthier ageing but also a delivery of quality education to children in the remotest corners of Vanuatu, improving access to quality health services, making government services much more accessible, as well as increasing the efficiency of current recovery efforts and economic activities.The Government of Vanuatu considers that effective use of ICTs is crucial in achieving the national Vision of “Building a stable, sustainable and prosperous Vanuatu.”The one-day event will focus on two panel sessions and one pitching session, of which one can follow and enjoy these through online on ICT Website page and ICT Facebook page.Vanuatu started to join the rest of the ITU member countries to celebrate this annual event in 2012 as the National ICT Days.For the past 9 years, the National ICT Days was celebrated in Port Vila and last year a very successful event was held in Luganville, Santo, SANMA Province, for the first time, outside from Port Vila.World Telecommunication and Information Society Day (WTISD) 2022 will allow ITU memberships, partners and other stakeholders to raise awareness about the important role of telecommunications/ICTs in supporting people to stay healthy, connected and independent, physically, emotionally and financially – to a life of healthy ageing — and as critical for the sustainability of economic and health systems.Under the ITU, the telecommunications and information communication technologies (ICTs) have a role to play in achieving healthier ageing, but also in helping people build smarter cities, combat age-based discrimination at the workplace, ensure financial inclusion of older persons, and support millions of caregivers across the world.The UN General Assembly resolved in March 2006 that the WTISD would take place on the 17th of May, every year."

Basically it was to help children and young people to ‘bounce back’ despite their situations after the disaster.He said people receive relief supplies but it is not certain how affected the victims are psychologically. “The victim may need medical attention while he or she is offered some rice, tinned tuna and noodles,” he said.“But every child depends on adults to provide psycho social support, to help him or her to cope with his or her social surrounding in times of disaster.”It is Taevakalo’s wish to see 20 trainers link with a further 20 new trainers in each community, to assure children that despite the situations they have encountered, “there is always hope”.“We can work together to build on what we have currently to go forward,” he said. “Together, we can work to lift our community from the gutter to contribute towards a prosperous future of our country.”"

One of the growing challenges identified by both the industry and the Government towards a successful border reopening is the shortage of labour or skilled workforce in this sector, the Vanuatu Tourism Office (VTO) relayed yesterday. To address this shortage, the labour coalition has been formed between the Ministry of Tourism Trade Commerce and Ni-Vanuatu Business (MTTCNVB) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MOIA) through the collaboration of the Department of Tourism (DoT), Department of Labour (DOL) and the VTO to work together and facilitate the opportunity for registration and training of ni-Vanuatu into the tourism and hospitality sector for preparation towards the border reopening.Ms Geraldine Tari, Acting Director of the DOT stated that it is the role of the Office to facilitate the immediate need for restoring back excellence of service into the industry as part of being Tourism Ready, addressing the need for recruitment registration and training to prepare workers for the tourism and hospitality industry.“Over 50 businesses in Port Vila have been certified as ‘Clean Caring and Checked’ under the Safe Business Operations training,” she said. “It is important that they are being supported with skillful workers to prepare their businesses for border reopening.”According to the Commissioner of Labour (COL), Mrs. Murielle Meltenoven, the border reopening is everyone’s business.“For the MOIA and Government of Vanuatu, it’s a priority to establish the conditions for a strong domestic labour market that provides good job opportunities for all Ni-Vanuatu citizens during this reopening period,” COL Meltenoven said.The CEO of VTO, Mrs. Adela Issachar Aru, said the collaboration with the DOL and the DOT is critical to show commitment for rebuilding the domestic labour market, focusing on the tourism sector with the celebration of International Day in 2022.“We know that our people are very talented and skillful people,” she said. “In no time we will be able to re-train them and prepare them for welcoming all our international travelers and guests for Answering the Call of Vanuatu.“It is our people, custom, and culture that forms the experience of a lifetime, and we cannot wait to deliver this once more to our international guests.“In our preparation and effort to reconnect to the world and to support the Business Houses in Vanuatu, Employment Vanuatu is one of the best solutions to assist the industry with options to recruit the skilled person(s) to work with your company and rebuild our economy.”Employment Vanuatu, the employment registration portal launched by the DOL in 2021 exists to assist the business sector in its recruitment pool when looking for suitable candidates to work and grow their businesses.It is anticipated that planning for building Vanuatu’s domestic labour market will be supported through this tool of the Employment Services portal.To facilitate the smooth processing of tourism and hospitality workers who are both new and experienced, the DOT, in collaboration with the VTO has set up a Tourism Labour Desk to assist interested applicants, as part of its Tourism Ready activities to prepare the industry for the reopening of borders in July, 2022. The tourism labour desk is supported by the Australian Pacific Technical College (APTC) and the Vanuatu Skills Partnership (VSP) to ensure support is provided as part of the collaboration to develop a skilled labour force for the tourism industry.The Tourism Labour Desk Officers will be working closely with the DOL to coordinate registration of workers, facilitate training links to training providers and ensure there is a creation of tourism and hospitality ready-pool workforce.The Tourism Labour Desk will also work with training partners to monitor the quality of on the job training by the trainers and employees.Interested individuals are encouraged to come forward and use this helpdesk system by sending their CV to [email protected] or check the employmenvanuatu.gov.vu website for more information.Meanwhile, the International Labour Day 2022 also coincided with the VTO’s launching of a series of ten short promotional videos titled “Vanuatu, Yumi Kat Talent”, as part of a national Worker Attraction Campaign.The campaign aims to invite workers throughout the country to seek job opportunities within the tourism and hospitality sector, as the country is preparing itself towards the reopening of the borders.“We have something for everyone, please apply today,” is the message reiterated by COL Meltenoven.The 10 promotional video series will be shared across various social media platforms to create excitement and provide awareness support to the private sector, to fill their job vacancies with proficient employees who possess the right skillsets."

This is one of the first things to address, he stressed.Kilman said he believes Kalosil has the capacity to address the airline issues.Improving Air Vanuatu has always been a priority of the government.The government has been committed to saving the airline from financial crises over the years, which have been blamed on mismanagement.In 2021, the shareholders made changes to the airline board.The Finance Minister at that time, Johnny Koanapo, said the decision was taken to save the airline plagued with debts beyond its repayment capacity.He blamed political interference and negligence for the mismanagement.The previous government just before being ousted from power talked about tabling a paper in the Council of Ministers (COM) meeting on removing political interference from the airline.The former PM mentioned that change would see the new management consisting of technical members, not politicians.This is to ensure the airline runs in the right direction compared to when there was a lot of political interference in the past years."

He noted the significance of this achievement for both the PWD and the Ministries of Infrastructure and Climate Change.Van-KIRAP’s main goal is to utilise climate data to develop climate information platforms for informed decision-making across five partner sectors: Agriculture, Fisheries, Tourism, Water, and Infrastructure.Romone said climate change affects all sectors and daily life, making it challenging for the government to provide stable services to the people. This recognition is not only at the national level but also at the international and regional levels. VMGD has developed platforms through projects like Van-KIRAP to enhance climate information services across various sectors.He expressed his pride in the partnership and hoped it would continue to benefit the people of Vanuatu.Moriah Matou, Project Manager of Van-KIRAP, explained that the project emerged from a sector framework, primarily focusing on the Vanuatu Meteorological Service. However, recognizing the widespread impact of climate change on every sector and aspect of life, they sought to integrate climate information across all sectors.VMGD has been collaborating closely with several sectors to engage in climate-resilient projects for the benefit of the Vanuatu population. The Vanuatu Road Design Guide Project, supported by the Green Climate Fund, is a vital component of this framework."

121,https://vbr.vu/news/bsp-committed-to-local-communities/,2023-09-13 01:09:00,BSP Committed to Local Communities,"Bank South Pacific (BSP) Financial Group Limited has again demonstrated its commitment to supporting the health and wellbeing of the residents of Vanuatu by presenting Vatu (VT) 3 million to the Vanuatu Emergency Service Association (VESA), VT2 million to ProRescue Vanuatu and unveiling the refurbished Imere Maurifanga Health Centre.A statement released by the Bank this week relayed that since BSP’s expansion into Vanuatu in 2016, they have invested VT38 million improving local communities across various educational, health, sport, and environmental projects and programs.Robert Bradshaw, BSP Chairman, said, “BSP is honoured to continue sponsoring VESA to support the vital services they provide through ProMedical Paramedical and Rescue Volunteer. Our contribution allows VESA and ProRescue Vanuatu to deliver quality healthcare and help ensure critical health services are accessible to all who need them. Our continued support reflects BSP’s shared values and beliefs to provide a healthier and safer environment for all.”Since 2012, BSP has been an annual VT1 million sponsor of VESA with an additional VT2 million being donated this year; with many staff members and their families benefiting from the emergency care they offer.VESA National Manager, Angileeta Devi, thanked BSP for its generous support towards their services and stated, “the continued financial support by BSP ensures that our 24-hour ambulance response and medivac services continue to provide reliable pre-hospital emergency care to the people of, and visitors to, Vanuatu.”Additionally, BSP has provided a further VT2 million donation to Vanuatu’s volunteer health service, ProRescue Vanuatu.ProRescue Vanuatu’s Rescue Leader, Troy Spann, shared how grateful he was over BSP’s continued support to the organisation, stating “this generous donation will provide the means to complete the acquisition of a new Rescue Vehicle and purchase supplementary equipment to enhance its utilisation.

122,https://vbr.vu/news/death-of-a-newspaper/,2023-08-05 00:03:00,Death of a newspaper,"By Nic Maclellan.The closure of New Caledonia’s only daily newspaper Les Nouvelles Calédoniennes highlights the commercial and political challenges facing media across the Pacific.The death of a newspaper strikes hard — and not only when you’re one of its employees. “Les Nouvelles Calédoniennes was an institution in New Caledonia,” Thierry Kremer, secretary of the paper’s works council, tells me. “Its closure is obviously a great blow for the employees, but also an enormous loss for the population of New Caledonia.”Kremer and I met the day after the announcement of the decision to close a daily newspaper that has been published for more than fifty years. Staff were still coming to terms with the news, uncertain whether they would be paid their final wages and benefits.It’s true that New Caledonia, a French Pacific dependency of 274,000 people, has a vibrant media landscape, with a range of weekly magazines, two TV stations and many commercial radio outlets. But the death of its sole daily newspaper comes at a crucial time, with supporters and opponents of independence debating future relations with France.Founded in 1971, Les Nouvelles Calédoniennes soon saw off its only daily competitor, the venerable France Australe, which closed its doors after ninety years in 1979. To begin with, the new paper was a partisan broadsheet, promoting the interests of local business owners and campaigning against independence from France. It made little pretence of impartiality during the armed conflict that divided New Caledonia in the mid-1980s, denigrating indigenous Kanak and editorialising in favour of the anti-independence party, Rally for New Caledonia in the Republic.The paper was bought in 1987 by Groupe Hersant Média, France’s largest media conglomerate at the time. A decade later, after the death of founder Robert Hersant, a financial crisis forced Hersant to sell off many media outlets at fire-sale prices, including Les Nouvelles. In 2013, three local business figures formed the Melchior Group to take over the paper and affiliated businesses. Melchior’s majority owner was New Caledonian businessman Jacques Jeandot, with mining magnate Charles Montagnat and former supermarket owner Charles Lavoix sharing the remaining 41 per cent.“Hersant sold the paper for global reasons related to its media group and the great difficulties it was facing in Europe,” explains Kremer. “That wasn’t the case in New Caledonia, where it was making a lot of money. At the time, Mr Jeandot had been considering setting up a newspaper in competition with Les Nouvelles, so he seized the opportunity by investing in the paper.” It was an investment driven by the heart, adds Kremer, who believes Jeandot never made much money from the paper.The Melchior Group also owned printing presses, a range of giveaway magazines, Les Editions du Caillou publishing house and radio station NRJ-Nouvelle-Calédonie.From the start, the new owners faced significant competition, including from French government–owned TV and radio stations. Many advertisers moved onto social media, and partisan media organisations received subsidies from the administrations in New Caledonia’s three provinces. A long delay in upgrading the Les Nouvelles website and investing in new technology contributed to a loss of readership.The Covid-19 pandemic added to the financial pressures. Advertising slumped further and costs rose, prompting a hiring and investment freeze and an effort to reduce expenses by refusing to replace departing staff. Then in late 2022 the company decided to drop the paper’s print edition. It sold off its largest printing presses and went completely online at the end of December, placing a question mark over the future of other Melchior publications, like the weekly Le Gratuit, which used the daily’s print distribution network.These dramatic changes reverberated across New Caledonia. The rural Northern Province and the outlying Loyalty Islands Province relied on the paper and smaller local media such as Caledonia TV, the monthly magazine Le Pays and occasional newssheets issued by the provincial governments. For Pierre-Chanel Tutugoro, mayor of the east coast town of Ponerihouen, one of Les Nouvelles’s strengths was its local inserts and regular reports from the provinces and rural towns. “For local mayors,” he says, “it was an important way to reach out to the community. Now that’s gone and it’s unfortunate.”Tutugoro, who is also secretary-general of the largest independence party, Union Calédonienne, believes the decision to halt the print edition undercut the economics of Les Nouvelles. “They went online, but that effectively meant they were giving it away,” he says. “Even in the deep valleys in the mountains near Hienghène or in Ponerihouen where people have 4G, you could get the news each day at 6am. People who had a subscription were sharing the online version on social media.”The shift to digital-only was too little, too late. On the afternoon of 10 March, less than three months after the print edition closed, Melchior’s owners announced that the company would file for liquidation. Supporters of the group’s 120 employees rallied in front of the Les Nouvelles offices, but the court announced the liquidation of the company a week later.“It’s a brutal procedure,” the paper’s executive director, Yves Delauw, told local media. “We have to do things very quickly, because we could not make this announcement several weeks in advance and continue working in this context. From the moment the court pronounces the liquidation, everything goes very quickly.”The thirty-strong branch of the Société des Journalistes at Les Nouvelles deplored “the refusal of management to listen to the proposals and suggestions that we have made in recent years.” Management’s reluctance to take on new journalists and invest in new technology for the digital edition had led, staff believed, to a downward spiral.While commercial considerations drove the decision, the complex politics of French colonialism was also a factor in the demise of Les Nouvelles Calédoniennes.In the early years of publication, Les Nouvelles and the French government broadcaster RFO were the main sources of daily news for New Caledonians. Both were fiercely critical of the Front de Libération Nationale Kanak et Socialiste, or FLNKS, a coalition of pro-independence parties.In 1985, faced with these dominant conservative voices, the independence movement sought support from trade unions in Australia, New Zealand and various Pacific island nations to establish a community station, Radio Djiido. Together with the short-lived magazine Bwenando, Djiido was the only outlet to provide alternative views during the violent clashes of the 1980s.Decades later, Radio Djiido still operates on a shoestring, broadcasting news, talkback, feature interviews and music. Commercial radio stations and government broadcaster NC1ère, meanwhile, continue to air more conservative views. Coverage of competing perspectives has certainly improved in recent years, but most media outlets still editorialise against the FLNKS and oppose ending French colonial rule.“Even though Les Nouvelles was controlled by Mr Jeandot, Mr Lavoix and Mr Montagnat — all businessmen who might be described as loyalists to the French Republic — we remained a neutral newspaper,” says Thierry Kremer. The paper’s openness was its “added value,” he goes on, “but it created problems, in that you need to be aligned to a political group or party in order to receive major subsidies.”Independence activists don’t agree with that assessment of the paper’s strengths. While journalists like Yann Mainguet sought to maintain comprehensive coverage of statements from FLNKS leaders, many activists scoff at the notion that Les Nouvelles was an impartial voice. They haven’t forgotten the appointment of Fabrice Rouard, a former spin doctor at Noumea Town Hall, a bastion of the loyalist parties, as editor-in-chief in December 2013. Rouard notoriously told staff that the flag of Kanaky, the symbol of the independence movement and the Kanak people, should not appear in photos on the front page of the paper.“Fundamentally, this country lacks balanced media,” says long-time independence leader Roch Wamytan. “In terms of the written press, it’s completely unbalanced. When you look at Les Nouvelles Calédoniennes, you can’t say that it supported us!” In radio, by contrast, he sees more open debate. “We have a radio station that supports independence, and the other parties have stations like RRB. But for newspapers and magazines, there’s no such balance. There are monthly or quarterly newsletters, but the independence movement has never been able to find the finance to create a daily here.”In his role as president of the Congress, New Caledonia’s legislature, Wamytan quickly issued a statement of concern about the decision to close Les Nouvelles altogether. French High Commissioner Louis Le Franc was more measured: “This emblematic daily newspaper has provided information to the population of New Caledonia for more than half a century. Les Nouvelles Calédoniennes benefited from various assistance to the press, particularly during the Covid pandemic, which, alas, was not enough to maintain activity.”For staff members like Thierry Kremer, these sentiments provide little comfort. “We didn’t receive any support from the Southern Province, the Northern Province or the Government of New Caledonia, even when we were in some difficulty,” he says. “It is my personal opinion that, for them, it’s not a bad thing that we’ve closed. There are now people speaking out to help us as employees, but they weren’t there when we were in trouble.”The paper’s journalists express anger or disdain at the muted response of New Caledonia’s political elite. As the Société des Journalistes noted in its formal statement, “The loss of the only daily press title in the country, with an indifferent response from politicians and institutions, is a disaster for democracy, in particular in view of the electoral deadlines awaiting New Caledonians.”Les Nouvelles’s demise comes at a time when New Caledonians need accurate information more than ever. After three referendums on self-determination between 2018 and 2021, political leaders are now debating whether to replace the 1998 Noumea Accord, an agreement that has governed politics, society and the economy for the past twenty-five years. Time is short to strike a deal before the next provincial and congressional elections, scheduled for May 2024.Three separate delegations travelled to Paris in mid-April for bilateral discussions with French prime minister Élisabeth Borne and interior and overseas minister Gérald Darmanin. Despite the positive dialogue, fundamental differences remain over the way forward.Embedded in the French constitution, the Noumea Accord can only be changed by a three-fifths majority in a joint meeting of the French National Assembly and the Senate — a level of support that seems unlikely at the moment. President Emmanuel Macron lost his majority in the National Assembly in France’s June 2022 legislative elections. His recent decision to force through changes to pensions and the retirement age has crippled his standing in public opinion polls and eroded his political capital.The independence movement, rejecting this timetable, has so far refused to engage in trilateral negotiations with the French state and loyalist anti-independence parties. Union Calédonienne’s Pierre-Chanel Tutugoro says the FLNKS wants Paris to agree to a new treaty and a clear timetable for a transition to an independent and sovereign state.“Our proposed treaty highlights issues related to interdependence with the French state, during a period of transition after independence,” he said. “This will ensure there is no rupture with France. We’re following in the footsteps set by our forebears, seeking independence with full sovereignty, but with ongoing, albeit different, ties with France.”Within this complex debate, Tutugoro says the closure of the daily newspaper makes it difficult to share accurate information across the community. “If we do nothing,” he says, “we leave our community at the mercy of social media, where many people get their news. But on social media, there’s not much filtering of ‘fake news’ or political posturing or outright lying — so it’s irresponsible to rely on it.”Not surprisingly, Thierry Kremer agrees. “I hope that, for New Caledonia’s sake, a daily paper can be revived,” he says. “But would such a paper be as neutral as we were? The problem is that there will soon be provincial elections, which will be very important. I don’t understand why the French government didn’t step in, given the political context and the need to maintain neutral, accurate information in the territory.”What’s next? The Les Nouvelles website and photo archive are a historical resource that must be preserved, but they are also a valuable asset as the liquidators seek to pay off staff, shareholders and creditors. (Disclosure: as a long-time subscriber to the newspaper I am technically a creditor, though I’m not holding my breath awaiting a small refund for the balance of my annual subscription.)Les Nouvelles is gone, but in an increasingly polarised political context, new media may yet emerge. Local conservative politicians and business figures are discussing new projects, with conservative magazines like Actu.nc and Demain en Nouvelle-Calédonie looking at the economics of daily publishing.Last year, businessman and former right-wing politician Didier Leroux made a significant investment in the radio station Océane FM, as the basis of a new TV station. The new channel, dubbed NC9, would likely receive significant financial subsidies from New Caledonia’s Southern Province under its president Sonia Backès, leader of the loyalist bloc in New Caledonia’s Congress. Backès also serves as citizenship minister in the French government in Paris. With the audiovisual sector under the control of the French state rather than the government of New Caledonia, approval for editorial outlets opposed to independence will likely receive a sympathetic hearing. Commerce and politics are transforming the media landscape."

125,https://vbr.vu/news/who-launches-first-ever-global-report-on-infection-prevention-and-control/,2022-05-07 01:18:00,WHO launches first ever global report on Infection Prevention and Control,"The COVID-19 pandemic and other recent large disease outbreaks have highlighted the extent to which health care settings can contribute to the spread of infections, harming patients, health workers and visitors, if insufficient attention is paid to infection prevention and control (IPC). But a new report from the World Health Organization (WHO) shows that where good hand hygiene and other cost-effective practices are followed, 70% of those infections can be prevented.Today, out of every 100 patients in acute-care hospitals, seven patients in high-income countries and 15 patients in low- and middle-income countries will acquire at least one health care-associated infection (HAI) during their hospital stay. On average, 1 in every 10 affected patients will die from their HAI.People in intensive care and newborns are particularly at risk. And the report reveals that approximately one in four hospital-treated sepsis cases and almost half of all cases of sepsis with organ dysfunction treated in adult intensive-care units are health care-associated.Today, on the eve of World Hand Hygiene Day, WHO is previewing the first ever Global Report on Infection Prevention and Control which brings together evidence from scientific literature and various reports, and new data from WHO studies.“The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed many challenges and gaps in IPC in all regions and countries, including those which had the most advanced IPC programmes,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General. “It has also provided an unprecedented opportunity to take stock of the situation and rapidly scale up outbreak readiness and response through IPC practices, as well as strengthening IPC programmes across the health system. Our challenge now is to ensure that all countries are able to allocate the human resources, supplies and infrastructures this requires.”The new WHO report provides the first-ever global situation analysis of how IPC programmes are being implemented in countries around the world, including regional and country focuses. While highlighting the harm to patients and healthcare workers caused by HAIs and antimicrobial resistance, the report also addresses the impact and cost-effectiveness of infection prevention and control programmes and the strategies and resources available to countries to improve them.The impact of healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance on people’s lives is incalculable. Over 24% of patients affected by health care-associated sepsis and 52.3% of those patients treated in an intensive care unit die each year. Deaths are increased two to threefold when infections are resistant to antimicrobials.In the last five years, WHO has conducted global surveys and country joint evaluations to assess the implementation status of national IPC programmes. Comparing data from the 2017-18 and the 2021-22 surveys, the percentage of countries having a national IPC programme did not improve; furthermore in 2021-22 only four out of 106 assessed countries (3.8%) had all minimum requirements for IPC in place at the national level. This is reflected in inadequate implementation of IPC practices at the point of care, with only 15.2% of health care facilities meeting all of the IPC minimum requirements, according to a WHO survey in 2019.However, encouraging progress has been made in some areas, with a significant increase being seen in the percentage of countries having an appointed IPC focal point, a dedicated budget for IPC and curriculum for front-line health care workers’ training; developing national IPC guidelines and a national programme or plan for HAI surveillance; using multimodal strategies for IPC interventions; and establishing hand hygiene compliance as a key national indicator.Many countries are demonstrating strong engagement and progress in scaling-up actions to put in place minimum requirements and core components of IPC programmes. Progress is being strongly supported by WHO and other key players. Sustaining and further expanding this progress in the long-term is a critical need that requires urgent attention and investments.The report reveals that high-income countries are more likely to be progressing their IPC work, and are eight times more likely to have a more advanced IPC implementation status than low-income countries. Indeed, little improvement was seen between 2018 and 2021 in the implementation of IPC national programmes in low-income countries, despite increased attention being paid generally to IPC due to the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO will continue to support countries to ensure IPC programmes can be improved in every region.WHO is calling on all countries around the globe to increase their investment in IPC programmes to ensure quality of care and patient and health workers’ safety. This will not only protect their populations, increased investment in IPC has also demonstrated to improve health outcomes and reduce health-care costs and out-of-pocket expenses.– WHO"
126,https://vbr.vu/news/tighter-liquor-laws/,2022-05-17 22:54:00,Tighter Liquor Laws,"By Josepheen Tarianga.The Vanuatu Government plans to control the illegal sale of alcohol without a valid licence.It also intends to introduce the use of National Identity Cards to confirm whether or not the person purchasing liquor is over the age of 18 years.This was disclosed as the Bill for Liquor Licensing (Amendment) was tabled by the Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Minister for Internal Affairs, Ishmael Kalsakau yesterday, the second day of the First Ordinary Session of Parliament for 2022.  In 1969, the legislation was made with the intention to control the importation, sale and supply of alcohol in Vanuatu. There have been amendments since, but it has not deterred the rise of the social issues that alcohol has caused, said DPM Kalsakau.The DPM explained that the current amendment is intended to reduce the rate of social problems and juvenile misconduct related to alcohol consumption.Deputy Leader of Opposition, Jotham Napat, stated that the implementation of laws, such as the Liquor licensing amendment, made in Parliament is more than the government’s responsibility, but that of parents, church leaders and chiefs as well. If children are included in activities such as community work, counseling, church activities, trained to make good decisions and disciplined accordingly, alcohol consumption and issues it brings about can be reduced, said Evelyn Takalo, a parent.Another agrees that parents have a role to play in implementing laws around liquor, saying if alcohol fueled problems with juveniles escalate then the police should be called immediately.“Chiefs are already speaking to the youth and counsel them on substance abuse. However, youth these days do not respect elders and Chiefs like before,” said the President of the Malvatumauri National Council of Chiefs, Willie Plasua.“At the end of the day when there is a problem, chiefs are still the ones who deal with the discipline of the youth in some capacity.“When it comes to custom, cutting this problem at the root can easily be done by simply banning alcohol in areas that chiefs govern. When it comes to the law, dealing with this issue is much more complicated.”The Adventist Faith strongly stands against all substance use. “We have a health department that is very vocal about substance abuse and have organised many events to promote saying no to substance use,” said Seventh-day Adventist Pastor, Max Senembe.“In the Church, we discipline our leaders when it comes to alcohol and other substances. We believe in leading by example. If our national leaders strongly stand against it and do not just talk, but also lead by example, it will help.”"

The lessor wanted the aircraft to be redelivered as agreements were not met.The Daily Post source said the aircraft was inspected and prepared to leave the country this morning. A meeting between the Shareholders of Air Vanuatu, including the Minister of Finance, Minister responsible for the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities (MIPU), and representative of the Heavy Lift company yesterday has seen the government committed to sorting out the outstanding bill and continuing to keep the aircraft in Vanuatu. Public Relations Officer (PRO) to MIPU, Antoine Malsungai confirmed the government’s position is for Air Vanuatu to keep the aircraft to enable services domestically.According to Malsungai, the government will work on repaying the outstanding and keep the aircraft by way of continuing with its leasing arrangement.Daily Post understands that Air Vanuatu owns only two aircraft, an Islander and a Twin Otter. All other aircraft are leased from different airline companies.Last November, Chief Executive Officer of Air Vanuatu, Atu Finau revealed in an interview with Daily Post that the company has purchased two new Viking Twin Otter aircraft."

This project forms part of a bigger programme, Digital Response Connecting Citizens (DIRECCT), which is funded by the EU in collaboration with the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS) and implemented by the French Development Agency (AFD) in coordination with the Belgian development agency (Enabel).The COVID-19 pandemic has witnessed the world shift to digital services to remain connected and resilient during crisis. The Pacific health sector although facing constraints with its low digital connectivity, adapted and utilised digital mechanisms to respond to COVID-19 with the assistance from partners and donors.“Digitalization is a priority of the European Union and it has demonstrated its importance to combat COVID-19. In the European Union, it has supported the health and socio-economic response to the pandemic, and has helped manage through confinements, lockdowns, curfews, closures etc. Digitalization is also a priority of the European Union strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, but this part of the world is still lagging behind.I am happy that this project supporting the Pacific close the digital divides in response to COVID-19 will allow the region to catch up and facilitate the continuity of health services through more accessible and affordable digital services,” said the EU Ambassador for the Pacific, Sujiro Seam.The SPCDDR-COVID-19 has been developed in consultation with the beneficiaries and key partners, taking into consideration existing initiatives and identified gaps, with the intention to leave no one behind.SPC’s Deputy Director General Dr Paula Vivili said, “We will be working with 7 Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) and we have identified a few ICT gaps that we will be supporting. This includes the provision of mobile phones, laptops, tablets, projector screens, internet subscriptions. This will support in country activities such as contact tracing, webinars, and surveillance monitoring.”The SPCDDR-COVID-19 is implemented by SPC through the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network (PPHSN) and aims to progress the digital health system transformation within the Pacific Island countries and territories for the immediate future and post-COVID-19 era."

A concrete slab has already been poured to support the structure.This infrastructure could produce one ton of flour per day. After the construction of the production infrastructure, ACTIV will focus on developing a range of flours and training its teams in production techniques that respect food hygiene standards.The Association is also working on a recipe booklet that will illustrate the many possible uses of these tropical flours.The project aims to develop a range of gluten-free flours based on local tubers and fruits. Given its tropical climate and rich agricultural history, Vanuatu has exceptional foods, not only for their nutritional quality and diversity, but also for the special place they hold in the local cultural heritage.This project will also raise awareness of the nutritional value of these foods and encourage Melanesians to continue producing and consuming them.Vanuatu is facing an increase in Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), including Type 2 diabetes and heart diseases.These NCDs compromise the quality of life of the Vanuatu people, sometimes leading to premature deaths.The return to a local diet is thus part of a public health perspective to which this project contributes on its own scale.The Pacific Fund is a financing tool dedicated to cooperation projects in Oceania, promoting the integration of French communities of the Pacific in their regional environment."

A Virgin spokesman declined to say when the new schedule would be released or when the airline would return to the Brisbane – Port Vila route.This was operating four times a week before the COVID-19 pandemic closed Vanuatu’s borders in 2020.Apart from Air Vanuatu, Virgin is the only commercial airline that has regular service from Australia to Vanuatu.Air Vanuatu has already announced its full schedule including Australia which will commence when the borders reopen on July 1.Some tourist operators in Port Vila said they believed that Virgin was waiting until they were certain there would be no returning to any form of quarantine for international passengers. They feared a delay in schedule announcement could create a return to Vanuatu flights later than July 1.“Things have been impossible for us and Virgin often added more than 1000 tourists a week to our shores and we desperately need that again now,’’ said one operator.Meanwhile, an Air New Zealand spokesman has said that the carrier has no plans to return to a regular schedule with Vanuatu. They ceased flying to this country early in 2016 after claims there were problems with the standard of the runway at Port Vila airport.Even after major repairs to the runway, Air New Zealand has failed to return, leaving Air Vanuatu as the only international carrier servicing New Zealand. The Vanuatu Tourism Office is in communication with Virgin Australia, along with a range of aviation partners, regarding the re-commencement of flights. Virgin Australia remains positive about returning to Vanuatu and are watching the reopening protocols closely to determine an opening plan. "

Small business like the market vendors and the VT20 Mamas were very much affected in the lockdown as they were not able to sell their crops and food in their respective locations, this was the only means they depended on to meet their daily needs.Vodafone Vanuatu has taken the initiative to assist over 500 mamas in the business of market vendors and VT20 mamas with the fund assistance of VT2 million. With the help of the Port Vila City Council (PVCC), the female vendors were identified, and they will be able to receive the funds through Vodafone Mobile money service – M-VATU.“Yesterday, Friday 13th of May 2022, we were delighted to witness the first disbursement to 217 mothers at Anamburu market park in the presence of Municipal Town clerk, Area councils, mama market vendors, Vodafone Management and Staffs,” Vodafone stated.The female vendors were very happy to receive their funds in real time through the M-VATU digital payment platform. This initiative encourages them to use Digital services which is very new to most of them. They can now save the funds in their M-Vatu wallet or engage in other M-VATU services.“Vodafone understands the struggle of the vendors during the COVID-19 lockdown,” said Vodafone CEO, Mr. Barlen Lutchmoodoo.“Walking pass the market locations and seeing it all closing during the lockdown is truly a sad image. With the current situation we are facing, it becomes hard for the mama vendors to sell their crops or food and that is the reason Vodafone has taken this initiative to support our mama vendors.”The vendors shared their heartfelt gratitude to Vodafone for taking this initiative to support them in these trying times“We are privilege to have Vodafone at our doorstep and it is another milestone for the vendors,” Ward Secretary of Anamburu, Mrs. Ruth Edward said.“During the COVID-19 community outbreak in Vanuatu, we were not prepared with any Standard Operating Procedures to help the mothers go through the pandemic crisis,” Ward Secretary of Anamburu, Mrs. Ruth Edward, said.“Vodafone is the first company to come to our doorstep to provide help. What the mothers receive today will continue to help sustain their livelihood, in their homes to meet their daily basic needs. We really appreciate Vodafone and are grateful for this initiative.”PVCC Town Clerk Peter Sakita noted times are changing.“We need to step up and follow the new technology that is convenient for us,” he said. “M-VATU digital payment is one of them, you will no longer transact with cash, only the phone in your hands. This initiative taken by Vodafone will benefit many mothers today, it will help improve and make their lives easy.”The Vodafone Management mentioned that other fund disbursement phases will be launched very soon, and it will be extended to other islands in Vanuatu.“Vodafone will always support our local communities.

Principal Simon mentioned that the system will drive down utilities expenses, specifically gas.He added that it is an avenue to reengage with food waste in the kitchen to generate gas. Mr. Simon further acknowledged the project funding and VAS for installing the system.Mr. Prendergast stated that for the school, the system fits perfectly with the new Farm2Table program with vegetable scraps from the kitchens providing the fuel for the biogas digesters.He mentioned the system not only provides clean cooking gas, but it also reduces reliance on Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), a fossil fuel which has increased in costs in recent months. Each system reduces carbon dioxide emissions by around six tones per unit annually.Mr. Prendergast added that the large-scale rollout of Biogas units will give Vanuatu a firm basis to stand up in the international scene, when it comes to discussing measures to mitigate climate change impacts.The VAS is happy to engage with recipients of the project and believes it is a way forward in the fight against climate change in the Pacific.As the local distributor, it is partnering with PACECCS to implement their pilot program, where they will be measuring and quantifying gas output from the systems.Mr. Prendergast stated the PACECCS and VAS partnership aims to scale up the pilot program based on the carbon revenue model, with financial benefit sharing to end users. Further details of how this program will expand with be forthcoming soon.VAS hopes that the Vanuatu government will support the expansion of the Biogas initiative in Vanuatu with duty free status, similar to other renewable energy products such as solar panels.VAS has had the biogas digesters from Home Biogas under trial and observation for over 12 months. Being satisfied with the performance, VAS officially launched the product in Vanuatu for retail this year.The cost of the eight units donated by the Israel Ambassador to the Vanuatu government is approximately VT1.8 million."

When trainers provide excellence and quality to students we can move forward with our qualifications,” said Mr. Evans.“It is an exciting time and I am very humbled to assist in this new objective.”He added that with VIT offering business management and hospitality as well as technical engineering, it will add value to the University. Mr Evans said that from there more will develop further.The 2022 academic year will commence in March.VIT will also be providing evening classes as well. Mr Evans stated that anyone can attend whether it may be new students or workers in the industry who have completed year 12-13 to get employed.“Everyone needs to be multitasked. Regarding tourism, a lot has gone to RSE and if borders open tourism workers will be short. As borders open, we can be prepared to provide services.“We don’t want resorts get workers from overseas. We want locals to work.”VIT is also offering trainings to rural areas to address the government’s decentralization policy. It is working with local authorities to provide awareness and hand out forms for interested applicants.Mr. Evans assisted in setting up the Pacific Vocational Training Center some years back and is happy to share his experience at the national interest, in directing VIT to the future."

That’s what drove the government’s decision making,” he told the ABC.Fast dealAfter months of discussion and false starts, the final deal seems to have come together quickly. Documents from inside Treasury, obtained using the Freedom of Information (FOI) process, show a one-day process as approval was sought from different ministers involved.The morning after the deal was back “on”, Ms Rogers updated Luke Yeaman, deputy secretary of the macroeconomicgroup, and Vicki Wilkinson, first assistant secretary of the international economic and security division.Three other Treasury officials were on the communication, but their names were redacted in documents received by the ABC.The email appears to reference the Finance Minister, Trade, Tourism and Investment Minister’s Office, the Treasurer’s Office and a ‘minsub’ – a ministerial submission, but Treasury has not confirmed if this is accurate. “The letter has been signed by the FM and is currently with the TTIMO. We are told it should arrive in the TO later today.We’ll send up a new minsub in the next couple of hours. We haven’t changed the letter, but the submission will outline the changes that led to the delay,” Ms Rogers emailed.Through the afternoon, emails suggest the signed contract moved from the Treasurer’s office to the Trade Minister’s. An unsigned copy was circulated on email and by a form of communication redacted in the documents. The signed copy was handled in person.“It will be walked from office to office,” Ms Rogers added. By 3:00pm it was done.“We have updated the ministerial submission to reflect last minute changes to the transaction,” Ms Rogers wrote.“We understand that the letter will be walked around once signed from the Trade Minister’s office. I understand that they have been in contact.”Last minute analysisWhile the emails describe last-minute changes, a search for Treasury analysis of the changing deal came up empty.A search for Treasury reports noting Digicel in the fortnight before the transaction – and the day after it was announced – was refused because Treasury “holds no documents with the scope of your request”.“I arranged for officers in my division to search Treasury records for material relevant to your request. These searches included searches of emails and Treasury’s file management system. I am satisfied that no such documents exist,” Jim Hagan, chief adviser of the international economics and security division of Treasury wrote in refusing the request.This does not suggest that no analysis was done by Treasury, just that it was not captured in the FOI application.It also does not capture analysis that may have been conducted by other departments or agencies.One document was not released because it went before Cabinet and is exempt from FOI. Taxpayers will get to read it when Cabinet papers are released, in 20 years’ time.How you know thisThe Freedom of Information (FOI) process allows anyone to request documents from inside government departments and agencies.You can ask for documents – such as emails, reports or data – about yourself or topics of interest.Applications are free, but charges may be applied for processing the request.Treasury charged the ABC $202 for access to the documents that informed this report.Source: ABC Australia"

The project is funded by the Australian Government as part of the Cyber and Critical Tech Cooperation Project.It aims to empower young women address the cybersafety issues that they care about, in ways they can relate to. These new resources are based upon real-life experiences of young women to help others navigate cyberspace safely and productively.“The videos and booklets have been developed by a group of Ni-Vanuatu girls and women, so they contain authentic, targeted and practical advice, support and referral pathways,” says Juliet Matansawan, GO! Cybersafety Coordinator from CARE Vanuatu.Yasmine Bjornum, Executive Director of Sista added, “We have been working with young women who have courageously shared their personal stories and the challenges they faced in cyberspace. Young women are experiencing depression, anxiety, suicide ideation and internalizing shame as a result from having their privacy breached, or being a victim of cyberbullying or having their image shared without their consent. We hope these resources will be the start of a movement to make cyberspace safer for young women and girls.”The resources will be launched today (7 February) at the Melanesian Conference Room. Attendees will see the inaugural presentation of the cybersafety videos, hear from GO! Project staff and take part in an open discussion.From 8 February, Sista’s Facebook page will launch an online campaign using the new resources.Over the next fortnight, Sista will progressively release three cybersafety videos, questions to prompt discussion, and an online version of the cybersafety booklet. Everyone who engages with the campaign will have the chance to win prizes. Sista and CARE will be looking out for the best responses to the resources and questions.Winning responses will receive a GO! t-shirt or stickers and be featured on the Sista Facebook page."

It was facilitated by trainers from Breadfruit Consulting, the University of the South Pacific (USP) and AUF. It is open to the public and it is a first for AUF to engage with students regarding innovation.Furthermore, it aims to promote entrepreneurship within country. AUF has conducted entrepreneurship workshops in the past with local entrepreneurs but has resolved to enroll students this year.According to AUF, the target of the Innovation workshop is to bring students together and come up with effective solutions to address issues and challenges faced within the society. It also seeks to prepare students effectively while addressing the challenges at hand with flexible solutions.The activity saw participants getting into various group exercises to discover how to solve problems in educational, social, and community life that will serve each individual in their daily lives.AUF stated that at the end of the 2-day event, 25 students will be selected to benefit from a free 10-day workshop training on entrepreneurship. The training will see the students learn how to set up their personal project as well as providing them the opportunity to engage in entrepreneurship.“It provides an avenue for students after completing studies, to apply for job opportunities or better yet engage in entrepreneurship,” said Bosco Boukone, facilitator and AUF technician.The workshop will end today (Wednesday), and participants will present their projects before a selective 25 students will head into the 10-day entrepreneurship workshop.Over VT1 million was budgeted for both events."

General Manager (GM) of VNPF, Parmod Achary, said the Fund could not collected more contributions due to COVID-19.“By now we (VNPF) should be collecting up to VT3 billion in contributions. Unfortunately, because of COVID-19 are still struggling between VT2 to VT3 billion for the last few years,” he said.The contributions generated by VNPF in 2020 and 2019 was VT2.3 billion. The contributions for 2018 was VT2.2 billion, VT1.8 billion in 2017 and VT1.6 billionGM Achary said VNPF is projecting an increase in revenue this year and the next years, as it is now focussing on quality investment.As of last year, VNPF has 86, 924 active members. Almost 4, 000 employers were registered with VNPF from 2016 to 2021.A total of 701 employers were registered last year, 1, 259 in 2020, 1, 190 in 2019, 990 in 2018, 282 in 2017 and 271 in the previous years.In the month of December alone last year, 559 members were registered in Port Vila, Santo, Tanna and Lakatoro in Malekula.Apart from the formal sector, VNPF continues to extend coverage into the informal sector, which comprises majority of the population and they lack social protection. According to GM Achary, over 3, 000 informal members were registered last year.VNPF is the only retirement fund in the Pacific that allows for seasonal workers to open accounts and contribute to the fund. The number of informal workers, mainly domestic workers, market vendors and farmers is increasing.VNPF begun extending services into the informal sector few years ago. Since establishment, informal workers were not covered, only formal workers.The majority of Vanuatu’s workforce is in the informal sector and have no access to social protection. A lack of social protection is an obstacle to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals on ending poverty, inequality and improving healthy lives and well-being.According to the International Labor Organisation (ILO) supported Vanuatu workers rapid assessment on the impact of COVID-19 and TC Harold in 2020, the share of workers employed in the informal economy was 66.9%.ILO is providing financial and technical assistance to support VNPF with the deployment of digital platforms for the informal sector.Digital platforms for informal workers to access VNPF services have been launched with Vodafone, Digicel, Bred Bank and also Vanuatu Post."
144,https://vbr.vu/news/would-you-go-to-a-kava-bar-producers-of-the-psychoactive-drink-want-a-mainstream-market/,2022-02-15 02:09:00,Would you go to a kava bar? Producers of the psychoactive drink want a mainstream market,"By Emily Clark, Lice Movono and Fletcher Yeung in Suva.You can’t just take a sip of kava; you have to drink the whole bowl down in one go and you can’t have it when you’re angry or it’ll make you feel worse. That’s the advice in Fiji.There is a traditional way to consume the drink known for its relaxation effects, but there are also kava bars and cafes and sachets of instant mix.In modern times, the drink made from the root of the yoqona plant hasn’t had a great reputation, condemned as something that numbs the brain and ‘dopes’ the drinker.But in Fiji, it’s attracting a new crowd — the after-work corporate crew who want to unwind, and the Saturday night social scene that has found a way to hang out and listen to music without consuming alcohol.Kava is a controlled substance in Australia, but some of the regulations around it are changing and producers across the Pacific are hoping their product can find a new market in the mainstream.‘It feels good’Mana Coffee in Suva has a children’s playpen out front and and all-day breakfast menu. Come evening, the back room turns into a kava bar and on this Saturday night, it’s full.The band in the corner is taking breaks only to down a bowl of kava, with one member insisting the drink “makes you happy”.“It’s stress relief. If you’ve had a long day, one bowl is relaxing. It feels good,” he said.As the hours pass, a few tables change, but mostly those who are here are in for the night. Each group of friends shares a communal bowl — the tanoa — and slowly empties it, snacking on salty ‘chasers’ between drinks.Suluetiwainiqolo Vukialau first had kava when she was 18. And while she didn’t like the taste initially, the drink has come to play a very special role in her life.“Sometimes I have kava with my dad or uncles. Some of them come from work, stressed, I will sit with them, we communicate and enjoy each other’s company,” she said.“It’s been a long day, and we’ve been separated, and then we come together as a family in front of the tanoa and we share kava together.“It means a lot.”It’s easy to buy kava across Suva. Convenience stores sell high-grade powder next to the day’s newspapers, fresh eggs and spare batteries, and as you drive through the city there are countless dive bars serving the drink.But Mana Coffee has found a new market and it’s this consumer that kava producers in Fiji are hoping they will be able to find in Australia.From their village to your cafeTo enter some remote villages in Fiji, you have to seek permission from the chief and part of that is making an offering of kava.A ceremony takes place and after downing a bowl of the drink, you’re welcomed and are allowed to move around.The village of Navunisole is about an hour outside of Suva along the ring road that circles the main Fijian island of Viti Levu.It’s a small community with big plans for their kava crop.Farmer Aleveo Basaga believes selling his kava to overseas markets will lift the standard of living for everyone in Navunisole.“In Australia, America, if they like kava, it’s good for them and for us too,” he said.The men gathered around to show off the kava crop are speaking Fijian. It’s explained that they’re saying how lucky they are to have their farm visited and Aleveo is nervous to be interviewed.He’s surrounded by children of the village and gestures to them when he’s talking about his vision.“Harvesting my kava, I sell it, I get the profit… share it in the village so we can all grow up together,” Aleveo said.Kava is one of the most valuable crops across the Pacific.Aleveo and his workers dig up a three-year-old plant to reveal its root system — the fibrous threads that will be processed into powder and, hopefully, exported across the world.He says this yield is worth $FJD400 ($263).Across Fiji, there are more than 10,000 kava growers whose households and communities will benefit from growth of the industry.But for the potential economic impacts to be realised, Fiji’s kava needs to evolve from its raw form to standardised and safe consumer products.In 2019, the Australian government announced it would allow the commercial imports of kava from Pacific Island nations — something that was banned 15 years ago.Kava was introduced into Australian Indigenous communities in the 1980s as a substitute for alcohol, but excessive consumption in some areas led to health problems.Kava was listed as a schedule 4 drug and prohibited from being brought into the country in commercial quantities.The Australian Drug Foundation warns the consumption of kava can lead to liver damage when consumed with alcohol.The government’s own risk statement notes: “ongoing high-quantity consumption has been associated with ichthyosiform skin rash, altered liver function and a decline in general health.”The decision from Scott Morrison’s government to lift its ban on kava imports was an unexpected one and Indigenous leaders warned it would put their communities at risk.Now, the date set down as the moment commercial imports could resume has arrived.From December 1, importers have been able to apply for a permit to bring kava into Australia and ultimately sell it to consumers.For Fijian producers, the challenge now is to ensure their products meet all the regulatory requirements and that they can connect with an importer in Australia.An Australian and New Zealand government-backed program called PHAMA Plus helps industries in the Pacific gain access to foreign markets.Sangita Kumar from PHAMA Plus has been working with Fiji’s kava industry.“There is a disconnect that happens between producers, the exporters and the market, so we are trying to bridge that gap,” she said.“Given the opening of the commercial kava pilot in the Australian market, it becomes even more important to make farmers aware of what the market requirements are.“It’s an opportunity for our exporters to enter into a new market segment in Australia, beyond the Pacific diaspora.”At the end of last year, there had been 133 applications for permits to import kava during the trial.Kava next to tea and coffeeFrom raw kava root, to a standardised powdered product with regulation labelling — that’s the process the Fiji industry has been trying to nail.The chemicals in kava that give the drinker feelings of relaxation and a sensation that has been compared to prescription medications such as Valium or Tempazepam are called kavalactones.This active ingredient varies depending on where the kava was grown and how it’s been processed, so to sell kava in Australia, processors in Fiji needed to standardise their formula.Lami Kava director Donny Yee Jason has made changes to the company’s processing facilities to meet regulations.“We control the environment, we control the cleaning, we control the drying and the peeling, so the whole process has been controlled,” he said.Individuals are allowed to bring kava powder into Australia for personal use, but the quantity is capped at 4 kilograms per person and it’s usually in unlabelled packaging.An amendment to Australia’s prohibited imports legislation has cleared the way for kava to arrive in commercial quantities, provided the importer obtains a licence and meets other relevant regulations.The products will still be subject to state and territory legislation and currently the sale of kava is prohibited in the Northern Territory.The types of stores it can be sold in and and who is allowed to buy it will also be subject to state and territory regulations, as well as national food standards, which are currently being updated.Existing permissions around kava in the food standard seek to limit its consumption to traditional use.But submitted as part of the review process, a Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand proposal noted:“In recent times, [kava] has become more widely consumed as a recreational beverage in both the Pacific community as well as in the wider international community.“This significant history of use demonstrates that it is possible to safely consume kava beverage in moderation for traditional and recreational purposes.”For members of the Pacific Island diaspora, easily accessing kava in Australia is about easily connecting to culture.Donny wants kava to have a broader appeal too, and for Australians to think about the drink like they do some of their favourites.“We want to place it alongside tea and coffee — cafes, supermarkets, health shops,” he said.“America was the same. It started off with the Pacific Islander diaspora, and then it’s grown into the typical American drinking it now.“There are over 300 kava bars in America, so hopefully the same thing will happen in Australia. Only time will tell.”– ABC"

The freezers are made of long lasting non corrosive fibreglass material and high quality parts. Continual testing shows Fibre Ice systems are able to hold -25 degrees and maintain -18 degrees for extended periods of time as per International Food Standards. This is excellent performance considering the likely delay in arranging repairs in remote locations.”Minister of Tourism, James Bule, signed the contract with Mr. Mackenzie for the supply of the solar fibreglass refrigeration systems to be supplied to tourism operators in all six provinces of Vanuatu as part of the Produktif Turism Blong Yumi Initiative.“I spent over VT500,000 on a solar refrigeration system for my rural tourism business on Ambae from a different supplier and not long after installation it hasn’t been working,” Minister Bule stated during the signing.“I’ve just wasted money after 12 months because I have something that doesn’t work and is out of warranty. This is not good enough for our rural businesses. Unlike the system I brought, the ‘Fibre Ice’ solar refrigeration is looking very promising. Considering the 10-year warranty and impressive results from testing of the ‘Fibre Ice’ systems and the fact that it’s supplied by a reputable local business gives me great confidence.“As Minister responsible for tourism I want to see more collaborative business models such as this with genuine partnerships between foreign and local businesses going forward.”The Vanuatu National Energy Roadmap 2016-2030 (NERM) has a target to provide 100% access to sustainable and reliable electricity in off-grid areas by 2030.In 2019, the Department of Tourism (DOT) participated in pilot solar subsidy scheme for off-grid solar freezers for 13 remote small tourism businesses in four provinces.As part of the monitoring and evaluation of the solar freezers, the systems were found to be inadequate to the conditions in rural Vanuatu.“The suppliers claimed the life expectancy is 5-7 years with a 1-year warranty, however in less than 6 months most of those solar freezers were showing significant impact due to the salty humid environment with corrosion being the biggest problem,” DOT Director Jerry Spooner stated.“This review shows us what happens when we go for cheap products that are not suited to rural life in Vanuatu. As part of our Vanuatu Sustainable Tourism Policy (2019-2030), National Sustainable Development Plan (2016-2030) and commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals we must ensure our rural tourism operators have access to high quality long lasting products that can withstand rural conditions and keep food safe for visitors.“It is not environmentally sustainable to support products that end up in landfill after 12 months or as we mostly see, they end up becoming mosquito breeding grounds.“And with the increasing impacts from climate change our tourism operators need access to products that can support them to be resilient while also reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. We would prefer high quality products that may cost a little more but will last longer and give confidence to our rural tourism operators.”"

This scheme has obvious benefits in terms of stimulating the rural economies of Vanuatu during the global pandemic by empowering Ni Vanuatu with the tools to live sustainably off the land and sea.The first 18 boats for 70/30 subsidy were put to an official tender process late last year and Vila Marine was proud to be selected as the supplier.The official signing was made with the Minister of MALFFB Willie Daniel on Wednesday the 13th of January, 2022.Vila Marines fiberglass boats are now overwhelmingly the preferred choice of fisherman and transport operators throughout Vanuatu and this is evident based on the fisherman choosing a Vila Marine boat during initial applications from candidates of the 70/30 scheme.The boats that Vila Marine meet the strict criteria set by the Government in terms of hull construction and safety. All our boats are constructed using only composite materials with no wood that will rot when wet.Unlike other manufactures in Vanuatu our boats are made using the latest in lightweight matts and cores while using vinyl ester resins which are specifically designed for use in a saltwater environment.Other manufacturers in Vanuatu and around The South Pacific only use Polyester resin which over time can lead to osmosis (Fiberglass rot). This is because Polyester resin is cheaper however Vila Marine can offer a competitively priced boat using only top-quality vinyl ester resins.This all results in a stronger and lighter boat that rides significantly better in rough conditions and consumes less fuel. Safety is provided through electrical power to the vessel with a solar panel on the front cabin.This allows us to fit lights and electronics such as a GPS/Fishfinder which no other manufacturer can do currently in Vanuatu. Also, each boat will be supplied with an OMR approved list of safety equipment, especially Solas approved life jackets that come with a water activating light and a whistle.In addition, the boats are 100% buoyant even if swamped with water and are also equipped with lifesaving ropes on either side should by accident the boat be capsized.In an emergency situation the passengers can hold on to these ropes until rescue arrives no other boats in Vanuatu currently have these safety features.As there are significant delays with manufacturing around the world, Vila Marine prides themselves on delivering orders within only weeks from the time of purchase.Other manufacturers not just in Vanuatu but around the world now have an 8-12 month waiting period on new boats once ordered. Vila Marine has constructed over 1500m2 of building to build quality Vanuatu made fiberglass boats to Australian/New Zealand standards.The commitment continues into this year with more manufacturing space, more moulds and further investment in time saving equipment such as state of the art spray guns for painting and chopper guns for quicker lay-up.We continue to reinvest in plant, equipment and our 20 plus Ni Vanuatu staff in order to provide a world class quality product on time and on budget. All staff have only best in high quality PPE, clothing, masks and safety boots.Finally, Vila Marine is the only boat building company in The South Pacific with a sustainable business plan. Already the current factory is powered by renewable energy in the form of grid tie solar which reduces the need for using dirty fossil fuel-based power provided by Unelco with reductions of around 75%.By the end of 2022, all boats will be constructed in a 100% green factory that is powered entirely by solar with battery storage as well. There will also be an in-house acetone recycling machine to significantly reduce the need for the disposal of waste chemicals. This will drive us to long-term cost savings and reduced environmental impact.Vila Marine looks forward in continuing to help support the growth of the agricultural and fisheries sectors in partnership with the Vanuatu Government now and into the future."

Its contract was renewed in 2018 again.General Manager (GM) of VNPF, Parmod Achary, said the auditors could not came to Vanuatu to do audits due to travel restrictions from COVID-19.“They (auditors) could not come and we have been doing it remotely. We expect it to be completed before the Parliament sitting,” he said.Once completed, the draft audited accounts are submitted to the VNPF Board for approval and will later be sent to Parliament for approval.Last year, GM Achary announced that VNPF was supposed to declare the members’ interest rate for the 2020 financial year.He explained that did not happened due to the audit delay.He assured the members that the annual interest will be announced once approved by the VNPF Board, following the completion of audits.VNPF started declaring annual interest for members when GM Achary took office several months before 2017.VNPF was unable to declare an annual interest in 2017 because of its negative reserve fund. The interest rate for 2018 was 1% with around Vt200 million credited to members’ savings. The 1% interest rate was a result of a Vt500 million gain.The Fund’s financial position in 2019 was considered the best, compared to previous years. VNPF declared an interest of 1.2% interest for that financial year with VT254, 420, 000 paid to all members."

In particular, Minister of Finance and Economic Management, Johnny Koanapo Rasou (MP) was highly involved in its design and launch along with the Director General of Finance, August Letlet. It has been specifically designed to provide a fast economic stimulus to the rural business communities to increase productivity and growth.With the ‘Yumi Growem’ loan product, the Bank is offering a highly discounted interest rate to clients in the primary sectors of Agriculture, Industry and Services.

Unfortunately, it is evident that the opportunity for low income families to have a decent home is becoming difficult with the increase in land prices and cost of building materials,” he stressed.“If the government, through NHC does take any decisive action, there will be an increase in shanty towns or squatter areas in the peripheries of Luganville and Port Vila.“This is already evident in areas such as Erakor Half Road, Blacksand, Manples and Etas on Efate.“The forum will discuss options to interest rates of home loans.“The current interests offered by commercial banks are too high. Reducing the rates will enable low income families to afford housing.“The Housing Policy will encourage affordable interest rates on home loans.“Another goal of the national forum is to seek seed capital from the government and international financial institutions like the World Bank, UN Habitat for Humanity, Asian Development and United Nations Development Program, to support affordable housing programs in Vanuatu.”According to GM Tarosa, the forum will be open to the public.Prior the forum, consultations will be held in the main provincial centers.Outcome of the consultations will be presented during the forum, which is expected to be attended by institutions such as the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu, World Bank (Vanuatu Affordable Resilient Settlement Program), Vanuatu Finance Centre Association, Builders Association and the National Bank of Vanuatu (IsiHaus Program).NHC’s new 5-year Strategic Plan will also be presented during the forum."

In an exclusive with the Director of Livestock, Lonny Bony approximately two years ago, he predicted that the target might be delayed due to several justified reasons.In the latest Cattle Restocking Programme, with a release of new stock at Sarmette Plantation on Malekula at the beginning of this year, the Director of Livestock was located chatting at Norsup Airport with the Director of Statistics.Bong explained the urgent need for his Department to hand over his Department’s duty to the Department of Statistics, to start recording the number of cattle including the number of “new calves dropped” since the start of the Programme.While the EU is funding the Cattle Restocking Programme, it has insisted on having access to the correct information on the total number of cattle and new calves provided by the Department of Statistics.The Director said, “This is a normal expectation from the EU in Brussels to collect all their data on the number of our cattle from the Department of Statistics and not from anywhere else”.Asked what this would mean for his Livestock Officers throughout the country, Bong smiled and thanked his colleague from Statistics saying with confidence that it would be a relief for his staff to assist where possible but that they would now focus on breeding more new cattle to meet the growing “tender meat” demand from the world’s best organic beef industry."

The launch called for action and collaboration with all relevant stakeholders to join efforts in making Pacific IYAFA celebrations successful.The interactive session provided a unique opportunity to discuss the role that small-scale fishers, fish farmers and fish workers play in food security and nutrition, poverty eradication and sustainable natural resource use, in the region. The panelists have also highlighted the essential role of women in small-scale artisanal fisheries and aquaculture and how they contribute to the community empowerment“Small-scale fishers, fish farmers and fish workers provide healthy and nutritious food to billions of people and contribute to achieving Zero Hunger. For this very reason, it is incredibly important to recognize millions of small-scale fishers, fish farmers and fish workers,” stated Ms Xiangjun Yao, FAO’s Subregional Coordinator for the Pacific IslandsThe Pacific region is characterized by vast areas of ocean, dotted by myriads of islands that are home to thousands of coastal communities. These communities hold precious traditional knowledge and rights to inshore marine resources. Over the years, catches of the most accessible coastal resources – fish, seashell and seaweed of the lagoons and reefs have been declining in many Pacific islands. It is estimated that coastal catch added over USD300 million to GDP. In the Pacific, 88 percent of the households consume fish or seafood weekly and 58 kg of fresh fish is consumed per person, per annum in the region.“Pacific fishers are also adversely impacted by several factors such as climate change, population growth and COVID-19,” said Andrew Smith, the SPC’s Coastal Fisheries and Aquaculture Programme Deputy Director. “SPC is engaged in a strong community-driven approach that will build resilient island communities and sustainable livelihoods” he concluded.During the event, several video stories from fisheries from Pacific island fishers and fish farmers were shared, including a testimony from Ms Arun Lata, a woman aquaculture farmer from Fiji. “Due to the economic crisis from the health pandemic, my neighbors started to fish from my fish ponds too and I left it open.We don’t know who is going to survive, who is going to be there with all that’s happening. People need protein in their meal so I let them fish around the tilapia fish ponds,” said Lata."

In 2018, it rebranded as “Casino 21” to better reflect its new diversity and focus on entertainment after having come so far from the humble pokies only venue it started out as all those years ago.Mack says the changes weren’t just in the décor though, as he also believes that operators have a moral responsibility to accept a stronger “duty of care” in providing a clean, modern, safe and responsible environment for its guests, so the casino has more than doubled its security team throughout his time while also heavily concentrating on both security training and “Responsible Service of Alcohol” training for all staff to ensure guests don’t have to worry.“I want to provide a venue that my own daughter or wife would feel comfortable and safe going to regardless of whether it’s at 1pm in the afternoon or 1am in the morning,” says Mack.“We’ve even put on female security officers so that young girls and women have someone they may feel is more approachable if they have any concerns.”But he assures that the improvements for their guests won’t stop just because they’ve reached 30 years in the community.All new commercial air conditioning is currently being installed as part of their anniversary celebrations and Vanuatu’s first “non-smoking” gaming room is also being built to house many of the new games coming throughout this year.And as part of the 30th Anniversary celebrations this month, Casino 21 is giving away great prizes four times a day including Air Vanuatu domestic flights, Samsung Smart TV’s and phones, and up to 100,000vt in cash every day throughout January.Congratulations to Casino 21 on achieving such a huge milestone, and we wish them another 30 more years."

He also expressed his appreciation to the Chair of the RSS WG Meeting and Commander of the Fiji Military Forces, Major General Jone Kalouniwai for his ongoing support. DG Louma stated that the RSS WG was established to provide an avenue for discussing the development of the RSS, adding that in the face of the ever increasing and emerging threats to peace and security, it is incumbent on Members of the RSS WG to devise appropriate and relevant strategies to address common security challenges. “The importance of MSG RSS cannot be overstated. The current animated discussions on the Solomon Islands Government decisions with respect to its own security arrangements and the absence of Pacific Island input into the Indo-Pacific security narrative underscore the need for developing a RSS based on our needs and interests,” he emphasised.He said the Agreement Establishing the MSG (in Article 3) recognises the importance of aligning policies to further advance MSG members’ shared goals of peace and security. He further emphasised the importance of the RSS to address common security threats and challenges in the MSG region for our future sustainable development and prosperity, as recognised in the MSG 2038 Prosperity for All Plan. DG Louma stated that strategy had five strategic priorities, each of which was informed by common security challenges facing the MSG region, and captures both traditional and non-traditional emerging security threats. He alluded to the existing MSG agreements and cooperation on the Formed Police Unit and the Humanitarian Emergency Response Coordinating Centre (HERCC) as supporting instruments that would complement the MSG Regional Security Strategy.DG Louma hopes that the five identified strategic priorities of the MSG Security Strategy will surely complement and add value to some of the existing regional security initiatives as the Pacific Islands Forum’s Boe’s declaration. He said the national threats within Members’ jurisdictions are some of the emerging security threats that must also be explored in the formulation of the MSG RSS.In conclusion, DG Louma said that as Director General of the MSG Secretariat, he will keep a keen eye on developments in the RSS. “While I am pleased to note the progress made to date, the Secretariat would obviously need adequate resources to be able to deliver on the Strategy,” he said. Finally, he echoed appreciation to the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for their contribution and unwavering commitment and support to the MSG.The INP, in a statement, said that constructive engagement between Indonesia and the MSG will continue to be mutually beneficial, and will always be cemented by respect working relationship with each member. The INP is committed to hosting the 4th RSS WG meeting which was postponed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and is looking at the possibility of physically hosting the next 4th RSS WG Meeting in Indonesia at a time to be determined. The last RSS WP Meeting was held in Nadi, Fiji in 2019."
159,https://vbr.vu/news/employers-obligations-in-case-of-lockdown/,2022-04-05 21:28:00,Employers’ Obligations in Case of Lockdown,"In 2021, the Vanuatu Chamber of Commerce obtained legal advice on COVID-19 employers rights and obligations relating to vaccination and a lockdown. It commissioned a report which was prepared by Lee-Anne Sackett and Didier Hamel-Landry. The following is an extract from this report.Are employers obligated to keep staff employed during a lockdown and what payments are required?There are currently no legal guidelines for this. Employers can terminate with notice, require employees to take annual leave or offer leave without pay. Ministerial orders are needed.Under existing laws, employer have a duty to provide work in accordance with the period and number of working days in the contract. In other words, remuneration must be paid regardless of work being available as long as the employee remains in employment.The only exception to this is if there is ‘an emergency’ which prevents the employer for doing so. Given the ongoing State of Emergency declared due to COVID-19, there is strong legal basis for this exception to be grounds for breaching the duty to provide work, particularly if a government-issued order requires businesses to shut downThere is no legal guidance in the Employment Act to determine what happens in the situation that the employer cannot provide work due to ‘an emergency which prevents him from doing so.To address this, the following options are available:1. The Minister makes regulations providing further details of what happens in this situation.2. The employer can terminate the employee with notice, paying out all entitlements (outstanding salary or wages, annual leave and severance allowance) ‘as soon as the service has ceased. With this option, the employer will have no ongoing obligations towards the employee.3. The employer can require that the employee takes annual leave, if the employee has annual leave accumulated.If annual leave is not available, or if it runs out during the lockdown period, the employer and employee can agree for the employee to take leave without pay.The employee will remain in continuous employment and continue to accumulate annual leave and severance allowances during this period. If the employee does not agree to take annual leave, the employer may give notice of termination and pay out all entitlements.Employers are required to pay employees entitlements in priority over suppliers.If an employee that has been in continuous employment for over six years resigns during this time, the employer is still obligated to pay all entitlements, including severance allowance.4. It may also be possible for you to stand down your employees for the duration of the lockdown (as you are not able to provide work due to the emergency). It is not clear whether employee’s entitlements (e.g. annual leave and severance) continue to accumulate during this time.As detailed in the subsection above, there are also no laws to address what happens to an employee’s entitlements if their employment conditions are changed or reduced.For example, if the employee is able to do remote work but the hours of work reduced to below 4 days per week, this may no longer considered continuous employment but what payments are required to be made to the employee and when is not clear.Employers’ obligations in relation to staff that cannot work due to becoming sick with COVID-19 or isolatingWhat sick leave is available to employees if they fall sick with COVID-19?All employees in continuous employment are entitled to 21 days sick leave per year. Beyond the sick leave entitlements, the employee can cease to be employed if a medical practitioner certifies that the employee is unfit to continue to work. Ministerial orders are needed.For employees to be entitled to sick leave, they must be in continuous employment for over three months (working four or more days per week) and provide a medical certificate if away for two or more days (in Port Vila and Luganville) or four or more days (outside of Port Vila and Luganville).They are entitled to 21sick days leave each year and the employee is responsible for notifying the employer of their illness unless the employer is aware of the nature of the illness.Medical certificates cannot be backdated beyond four days from the date of the examination, and employers can send an employee to a certified medical practitioner for a second opinion at the employer’s expense.In situations where employees do not have sufficient sick leave, the employee may be considered (under current law) to be unfit to continue to work and the employee then ceases to be employed.For this to apply, a medical practitioner under the Health Practitioners Act must certify the employee being unfit to work.In this case, the employer would be required to pay out any outstanding wages or salary, annual leave and severance allowance.This is unlikely to be a practical solution in the context of COVID-19.An alternative option would be for the Minister to provide guidance in a regulation or order for this.Possible wording has been provided in Section 5 below.Employers still maintain the right to terminate the employee with notice, paying out all entitlements, or to require the employee take annual leave, if the employee has accumulated annual leave.When can an employee return to work after testing positive to COVID-19?There is currently no legal guidance around when an employee can return to work after having tested positive for COVID-19.SOPs should be developed to reflect the guidance issued by the World Health Organization (WHO).Under current law, employers’ duties to provide safe working conditions for his or her employees and a duty to ensure health, safety and welfare at work continue in this situation.The responsibility falls on the employer to determine what measures need to be in place to ensure safe working conditions for both the employee returning to work and those that have remained in the workplace and the risks involved in early exposure."
160,https://vbr.vu/news/women-chefs-expanding-horizons/,2022-04-05 21:36:00,Women Chefs Expanding Horizons,"Alternative Community Trade In Vanuatu (ACTIV)- a Spotlight Initiative grantee – has kickstarted Aelan Mama’s Cuisine, a social enterprise training women in food preparation, menu planning, and the sustainable management of a small business.During the training, 11 chefs learned more than just new culinary skills. They learned that knowledge means power, resilience and independence, and that it can lead to change and inspire women to become active leaders and role-models in their communities. Myriam Malo lives in Vanuatu, her journey to self-empowerment started from her kitchen at the central market of Port Vila, where she used to cook and sell food. With COVID-19 lockdown, Malo together with many other women like Emmy Siro, who was working in a hotel, ended up at home, with no other income. While uncertainty in the future of local businesses and tourism was ramping up, Malo and Siro together with other nine ni-Vanuatu women — some of which survivors of gender-based violence — had the opportunity to join a training organised by ACTIV to upgrade their food-preparation skills and learn more about food security, menu planning, finance and the sustainable management of a small business. Fast forward a few months and the newly graduated chefs opened Aelan Mama’s Cuisine — a new restaurant available also online at https://aelan.vu/store/ — which guarantees a job and a continued stream of income for the women and their families. Aelan Mama’s Cuisine marked the beginning of a new era for these female entrepreneurs. The impact of the training went way beyond the kitchen. It opened the eyes of women like Myriam and Emmy to new horizons, not only in the restaurant business but in understanding the power of knowledge and the opportunity it represents, opportunity that up to that time had been out of their reach. “While we were learning about food safety and finance management, we were so excited, we were in tears. We could all sense how this would have changed our lives forever,” said Siro, a new chef of Aelan Mama’s cuisine team.The training gave women the means to reclaim their agency and become more independent in taking decisions and managing finance, and voicing their needs for more learning opportunities to emancipate other women, especially those living in remote and rural areas of Vanuatu. “We need to help all the mamas get some training” said Malo, a community leader and chef of Aelan Mama’s cuisine team, “together we need to join forces to demand more learning opportunities for women and girls,” she added.The training blazed new trails to the new chefs and their communities, in a country where the combination of discriminatory attitudes and violence against women hinders women’s full and free participation in education, employment and public life. Malo has become a champion in her own community, leading change in the group of women in her village, working alongside the community chief and the committees in the village. She is now getting involved with the Youth Council of 21 Jump Street working on an awareness raising and knowledge-sharing project to sensitise young people about the impact of processed and imported food, on their health, the environment, and the local economy and livelihood. “When it comes to food and nutrition, we need to go back to our roots, and I mean it literally.” said Malo. “What we eat impacts our health, the environment, our culture, and the local economy and livelihood.”She stressed that there is an urgent need to sensitise young generations towards the use of locally sourced food and traditional cooking. “The training granted permission to all the women to dream bigger and broader, especially when it comes to their rights to learn new skills and participate in the community,” said Sandrine Wallez, president of ACTIV.The group of women chefs — now agents of change — is now thinking of new strategies to create more learning opportunities, not only in food preparation but also sewing, weaving and the creation of artefacts to empower more women. “We tasted what it feels like to be in the driving seat and take decisions that influence our lives and that of our community, that was the real revolution, there is no going back”, added Malo, who is now considering running for the municipal elections in Port-Vila to ensure women’s requests are heard and acted upon. “All the women need to know the basics of food safety, food preparation and finance. We need to reach all the women, we need to sit around the table where the decisions are made to channel the resources needed for women and girls’ training,” she concluded"

These are significant and critical steps in ensuring we are tourism ready,” said VTO Chief Executive Officer, Adela Issachar Aru.Through the SBO Coalition, which is a collaboration between the DoT, the Australia Pacific Training Coalition (APTC), Vanuatu Skills Partnership (VSP), the Vanuatu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) and World Vision, more than 300 tourism businesses and 2,000 non-tourism businesses across Vanuatu have received Safe Business Operations training.Under the current national lockdown, training and certification checks for tourism businesses will continue using online tools, to keep the program moving forward. The Department of Tourism along with other partners are positive that more operators will complete the certification process in the coming months and more businesses will come out of hibernation to prepare for border reopening.Vanuatu’s Safe Business Operations (SBO) guidelines are modelled on similar programs across Australia and New Zealand. The training program covers enhanced cleaning and protection measures, personal hygiene measures, and provides correct information sources on COVID-19. This is the baseline requirement for all hospitality and tourism staff. Everyone will be doing this from the Mama’s selling handicraft in the markets to bus drivers, housekeepers, and tour guides. Air Vanuatu staff are also active participants in the program as are airport staff.Each workplace will have a COVID-19 safety officer. This person is responsible for safety in the workplace, liaising with authorities and staying up to date with Health messaging and guidelines. They will learn about the Vanuatu Alert Outbreak system and what it means for them as individuals and businesses. This is an enhanced level of training and responsibility.The preparation of a COVID-19 safety plan specifically designed for their business is a requirement at a supervisory level training.– VTO"

This is paid for by the Agriculture Department. Gradually, other markets such as Freshwater, Seaside markets and those around Efate will follow suit but under Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs).These market outlets will abide to SOPs developed by the FSAC, according to Iesul. He added customers and vendors have to wear their masks at all time during their shopping.The Principal Agriculture Officer urged people to be patient when entering a venue, as there will be a long queue as they are making sure that everyone will have a turn to shop, but they must follow strict COVID-19 protocols.The markets at Sepeta Hardware and Vanuatu Fresh Produce Market (Ex Leon Hardware) are open daily."

El Manaro works with kava farmers from all over Vanuatu to make their product. “We make our kava according to the orders we get,” he said. “We guarantee our customers no hangover and no dry skin. We have shipped to America, Europe, Japan, and even Belgium. People cannot get enough. There is a very big demand for kava in the international market.”Nako added that kava farmers stand to make a lot if they link up with businesses like El Manaro to market their kava. However, he admits that at the moment the prices may have to go up.“With the community outbreak of COVID in Vanuatu, there are no ships coming in and out and the prices for kava are going up, which means we may have to increase our prices and the customers won’t like that,” he said.In the Vanuatu National Kava Strategy (VNKS) created under the Pacific Agriculture policy project, there are development strategies outlined to help Vanuatu’s Kava industry to thrive with a set timeline from 2016-2025.“Kava is a major agricultural commodity affecting the lives of ordinary citizens, two issues the Vanuatu Kava sector faces is quality and quantity,” the VNKS stated.“There needs to be quality woven throughout all kava value chains and increased production of quality kava only after these issues are dealt with can the Vanuatu kava industry thrive.”Vanuatu kava has reached a milestone as it is now an international commodity. Cameron McLeod is the former owner of the Kava Emporium in Port Vila and an ex Vanuatu resident.He is among the first people to jump into terrestrial and online marketing of kava in Australia, where he now resides and runs the Australia Kava shop with much experience selling kava on the international market to places such as America and Europe.This is an online business that has partnered with local kava exporters in Vanuatu to market it internationally.Recently, Australia has changed its rules on kava. Before, the only way to get Kava in Aussie was for people to bring 4 kilograms when they fly into the country.Now, the Australian Office of Drug Control still considers kava as a controlled substance. However, as of January 1, 2020, importation of kava through a permit system is allowed with very strict requirements.“Ex residents of Vanuatu living in Australia have welcomed the chance to import kava and set up their own businesses since the rules changes,” he said.“Our site www.australiakavashop.com.au is one of over 5 business’s selling via websites and there are at least another 4-5 business’s selling kava direct on Facebook.”"

Guests in attendance included the Minister of Tourism and Trades James Bule, the Acting Director of the Department of Tourism — Mrs. Geraldine Tari, the Vanuatu Tourism Office (VTO) Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mrs. Adela Issachar Aru, the media and industry representatives and partners.In her opening remarks, VTO CEO, Adela Issachar Aru congratulated the MG Cocomo Resort team on this venture, saying children form a big part of why people and families travel, try new things and get new experiences.She said one of the most significant reasons for families to travel is “because it’s exciting, and we are in a constant desire to explore new things”.“Travel or taking kids out to somewhere new and different, can open their world to new learning experiences, food experiences, cultures, knowledge, people and other moments that aren’t always available within a classroom,” she said.Minister Bule said the opening of the new Pikinini Kona is an investment that is not only appreciated and welcomed, it also goes to show that tourism is very much resilient and alive for Vanuatu’s local economy.Minister Bule added that after almost two years since Vanuatu’s borders have closed due to the pandemic, the launch of another brand new tourism product brings hope.“The fact that we are doing this while the borders are still closed, goes to show that we as Government are hopeful, our investors are hopeful, and our people are happy that we are still able to provide services for our own enjoyment,” he said.According to Minister Bule, it’s important to invest now while the borders are closed, as research shows that visitors, especially in Vanuatu’s core-markets, are waiting to return as soon as Vanuatu’s borders reopen.“Our visitors have never stopped reaching out to us, asking when will Vanuatu open its borders, and we expect that they will come back in floods when we are able to safely do so,” he said.According to the Minister, preparedness and coordination will be the key drivers to our tourism recovery success and is part of the actions of the Tourism Crises Response and Recovery Plans (TCCRP) endorsed by the Government in 2020 to chart new pathways for tourism in Vanuatu.“I commend all tourism operators for your resilience but also acknowledge your struggles as we navigate through this crisis — It is not easy. On behalf of the Government, I applaud your achievements, new investments and successes,” he said.On behalf of MG Group Vanuatu Project and MG Cocomo Resort, GM, Mr. Danny Seah, announced that the MG Cocomo would continue their full support towards further development of the domestic tourism market which they believe is working.The MG Vanuatu Project Chief Representative indicated that with assistance from the MG Group in Hong Kong, an agreement with Interval International in Singapore last month has approved MG Cocomo to be one of their member resorts.According to Mr. Seah, Interval International, a subsidiary of Marriott Group, is one of the prestigious vacation exchange programs for international holidaymakers. Interval International has more than 2 million members worldwide in more than 80 countries. Every year, the members are allocated a choice of resorts to spend their holidays.“Therefore, by joining this exchange program, MG Cocomo is one of the listed resorts in the program for these holidaymakers,” he said.“By being one of the member resorts, we are further promoting Vanuatu and the MG Cocomo Resort to international holidaymakers. We will open up more new markets to support our tourism industry.”"

While most cruise itineraries will remain unaltered by the change of ships, a 10-night cruise to Vanuatu departing June 1 has been replaced with three shorter domestic cruises.Pacific Adventure will now begin her maiden season of cruises from Sydney on October 22, when Pacific Explorer will sail to Adelaide for a new mini-season of four cruises. Pacific Explorer will redeploy to Melbourne in November for three months, before returning to Adelaide in February 2023 for a longer season of nine cruises.Meanwhile, the Brisbane debut of Pacific Encounter has been rescheduled from June 4 to August 20, 2022, prompting the cancellation of 15 cruises.Ms Fitzgerald said the cruise line deeply regretted the cancellation of the cruises and any changes to itineraries, and apologised to all affected customers.“Unfortunately the shifting landscape over the past two years made it very difficult for us to anticipate when and where we would return to cruising.“Now we have more clarity and growing confidence, we have reset our plans to stagger the resumption of cruising in a way that enables us to bring our ships and crew back to Australia as smoothly as possible.”Ms Fitzgerald said P&O would be working closely with agents and affected guests to explain the changes and rebook them on new cruises.The cruise line will also liaise closely with the governments of Fiji, New Caledonia and Vanuatu on the planned return of cruising to those countries in the second half of this year.“Our new schedule anticipates a return to the South Pacific from August, but we will be working closely with governments throughout the region, as well as our industry partners, to ensure this is possible and that we meet all local protocols,” Ms Fitzgerald said.She said the cruise line looked forward to supporting its suppliers across fresh produce, maritime and logistics, entertainment, shore tours and travel agency once again and to contribute to economies throughout Australia.Guests whose bookings are affected by the latest announcement will be notified of the options available either directly or via their appointed travel agent."

It is generally a nose swab carried out under supervision, and done by a healthcare professional.According to VPH, tests are provided for only patients or anyone who has COVID-19 symptoms. VPH confirmed that the Ministry of Health had provided the tests on Tuesday this week and testings commenced on Wednesday.The tests provided by the MOH are free and on medical reference from any VPH doctors for suspected patients with symptoms, however VPH charges doctor consultation and health follow ups. VPH said patients get tested and wait for 15 minutes before getting their results.VPS Director, Carines Marchiori, said that patients are required to fill out a form for doctors to evaluate whether they need a test or not.“Currently we assist patients that face severe COVID-19 symptoms,” she said.“We have a separate facility to cater for patients who are positive for our health doctors to monitor patient’s treatment.”Mrs. Marchiori stated that all private centers received a batch of RATs, and are operating within the World Health Organization (WHO) and MOH policies.VPH is appealing to the public to refrain from panicking, and to continue practising MOH’s hygienic rules in homes and communities.

Two women representatives of 20 vatu food sellers made the above remarks, saying they simply do not know how to feed their families now that all kava bars where women sell cooked foods and meats to put food on the table, are closed so they do not know how to make ends meet.“Please hear us out, the lockdown is everybody’s enemy because we have not planned for it,” they said. “How are we going to feed our families? How are we going to survive? We are pleading with you in authority to help us find the quickest solution to this hardship because we cannot earn any money to put food on the table for our families with all kava bars closed.”I met many of them at Port Vila Market and they shook their heads saying they did not know what to do. There was a mixture of anger, concern and fear of the unknown on their faces.Two mothers said they used their last savings to buy two bundles of island cabbages at Port Vila Market. “Look at these two small bundles of island cabbages. We spent VT400 on them and the bundles are getting smaller and smaller,” they said.They are appealing to the Management of Port Vila Market to advise the farmers and vendors not to reduce the quantity of their greens due to COVID-19. “On the contrary, we encourage all farmers and vendors to not reduce the quantities of their produce because life is already as difficult as we have not dreamt it to be at so please, show as a little kindness and sell us only your best produce at a fair price. The current COVID lockdown should not be an opportunity to make money but also to help us provide for our families,” they pleaded.Both women said they have each applied for a loan from the VNPF. “We are living with our neighbours who have no food. Our idea is to use our withdrawals to buy basic food to support our neighbours too,” they said.Port Vila Market has started selling local produce to the public this week.The Management wishes to appeal to the public to respect existing procedures by entering at the door opposite Sea View.The population of the Capital has welcomed the beginning of the reopening of the Market.However, the Restaurant Wing is still closed.Customers who have always enjoyed breakfast and lunch next to the Sea Wall cannot wait to return when life returns to normal.

172,https://vbr.vu/news/kava-price-gradually-increasing/,2022-03-14 23:54:00,Kava price gradually increasing,"By Josepheen Tarianga.Port Vila is in its second week of lockdown, and many kava vendors and consumers have already noticed changes in kava prices over the last week.Many nakamals in the capital get the kava supplied to customers from other islands. These are often sent over by ship and bought leisurely in small bulks so the kava is always fresh. This has changed greatly for many Nakamal owners and kava vendors.For one, many Nakamals have closed to the public due to the community outbreak and where only a few are open, the kava is sold as takeaway.This means kava stock is bought in much bigger bulks as there is no guarantee that transport will be available consistently in the coming days.In addition, some nakamal owners have had to switch suppliers and mixes for their kava while maintaining their prices.All the Nakamal owners and kava vendors that have spoken with Daily Post all share that the price of kava per kilogram has definitely increased.The Seal Team Kava Bar at Independence park is among the few bars that provide takeaway kava. Kava vendor, Wilma Hake, said the Nakamal serves kava from Santo. Previously, this was sent by ship in smaller bulks but, that has changed.“The cost used to be VT800 per kg, but now we have to pay for airfare so it has gone up to VT1,000,” she said.“We used to get 60kg supply every two days, but now since we don’t know if we will keep having suppliers. We have now brought in 200kg of kava at a total cost of VT200,000. By Saturday, this supply will be depleted.”Mrs. Hake states that to ensure she does not make a loss, she has increased the amount of water in each mix of kava.The Seal Team Nakamal has seen consistent business during the lockdown as people order takeaway kava daily.Ronnie’s Nakamal has adopted the same takeaway only rule for kava, and the vendors have had to switch their suppliers to only Santo and Port Vila suppliers. Where the Kava Price Ronnie’s had with its kava suppliers was around VT500 per kg before, this has now increased to VT800 or VT1,000 max.“The Nakamal maintains the same prices for its consumers and business is good,” a kava vendor at Ronnie’s Nakamal shared.“I think it is because only a few nakamals are doing takeaway. Only one person is allowed on the premises to get kava.”The Dash Studio Natangura Nakamal is also now a takeaway kava spot. Michael Levu is a kava vendor there. Levu attested that he has had to switch his suppliers for kava from Santo to Port Vila, Teouma Valley where he always gets 12kg fresh kava daily.“I pay for VT800 per kg if I go and pick up my kava, but if they come and drop it off, I have to pay VT 1,000,” he said.“That is now the norm. By 6pm each day, all my kava is gone. I still sell 1.5 liters of kava for VT1,000 so business hasn’t changed much, other than prices for kava.”For now, the nakamal owners are hanging in there and are finding ways to make profit, how long that will last is anyone’s guess."

The premium chocolate maker is based in Mudgee, NSW, Australia, and produces single origin chocolate from cocoa beans sourced in Vanuatu.Mr. Benson Ezra, LRT’s Administrator and Manager stated that with COVID-19 pandemic disturbing economy trends, people should embrace the multi-task approach as a means of support for family income.He added that with tourism as a main source of revenue for the government in the past years, COVID-19 has paralysed international tourism, which puts velocity into government revenue. However, Mr. Ezra commented that with international tourism a challenge over the past months, people should be more involved within the agriculture sector.LRT is recognized in Australia for producing excellent cocoa quality. Chocolate made from this cocoa at the Spencer Cocoa company are its 72% dark chocolate and 42% milk chocolate which have received various awards at the Australian Fine Foods Awards in 2016, 2017 and 2019 (Gold, Silver and Bronze) and also awards from the Sydney Royal Show in 2017 and 2019 (Silver and Bronze).Mr. Ezra said that with self-discipline, determination and commitment, youths or anyone living in town or villages, can be part of such achievements. He said there are many avenues suitable in meeting farming businesses.Ezra added that believing in oneself and avoiding gossip and doubts is the way forward. Despite challenges, especially when exporting, and costly exercises, he believes all challenges comes as an opportunity to boost moral support in one’s journey.LRT Export also plans on setting up a chocolate factory in Malekula, as the business expands.LRT Cocoa Producers Business Premium was established in 2015. The company has 13 members and is a registered private local cocoa exporter to the Spencer Cocoa in Australia. It also supplies cocoa beans to the Gaston chocolate factory."

The United Nations SDG 14 that relates to Life below Water has immense significance to the Pacific region in that it strives to “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development”.Ministry of Fisheries Acting Director, Neomai Rativu, acknowledged all the experts who have continued to mould, mentor and coach the Fisheries Officers in Fiji in enabling them to become effective fisheries managers, leaders and influential community members.She stated the purpose of this training was to enhance and build the capacity, intellect, skills, and abilities of fisheries officers who played a significant role in the management of all fisheries resources.SAGEONS Head of School, Professor Surendra Prasad was delighted with the collaboration and the contribution of the SAGEONS’ Discipline of Marine Studies (DMS) in this project and congratulated the DMS team on the progress so far. The project is coordinated by Dr Rajesh Prasad.He stated that, “We are inextricably linked to the ocean in our Pacific region and have been since the inhabitation of these islands”.“In a metaphorical sense, we live in the ocean, and the ocean lives in us. The ocean is our life force,” Professor Prasad added.He stated the project was valuable as it aimed to involve ocean guardians, Fisheries Officers, and communities in taking appropriate actions to meet the SDG 14 targets.“The scientific knowledge of our talented USP academics, as well as the financial and other support provided by JICA, would allow the project to achieve its goals,” he said.He thanked JICA, the Japanese government, and the Japanese people for their continued friendship with USP and the Pacific people.DMS Associate Professor, Dr Joeli Veitayaki, stated this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for USP and the Fisheries Officers to participate in the ‘capacity enhancement’.“This training allows us to come up with solutions. We require such solutions in projects, which are intended to be directed interventions with a specific result,” he said.Addressing the Fisheries Officers, he said, “You are the chosen ones who are assisting in finding solutions. Our Government is a member of a high-level panel on ocean economy sustainability. We are committed to insulating a sustainable ocean economy in the coming years.”JICA Expert Advisor, Mr Minoru Tamura, emphasised that JICA provided technical and financial assistance to divisions.He stated it was a fantastic course for future work of the Fisheries Officers. In total, approximately 130 participants would benefit from this course and the project.Mr Tamura mentioned that participants who fulfilled the requirements of the course and project in different phases would receive a certificate upon completion.The proposed training will be on different topics, determined by the Fisheries Ministry and the participants through earlier consultation and workshop. The Topics of the Phase 1 training are: Fisheries Resource Management and Conservation (1): Coastal Fisheries; Fisheries Resource Management and Conservation (2): Offshore Fisheries; Post-Harvest (1): Theoretical; Post-Harvest (2): Field Trip and Laboratory Work; Aquaculture (1) Mud Crab Aquaculture; and Aquaculture (2) Tilapia Hatchery Production.The project will run until 2025 and will involve other Pacific Island countries in years 2024 and 2025."

As Seresere completed his Year 10 in 2014, he sprung to the opportunity to enrol in VIT’s mechanical courses. Unfortunately, the odds were not in his favor and he had to redirect his passion to ICT as there was no available space in the mechanics course. The ICT field was not a foreign subject to Roy as he had already participated in Computer Lessons during his Year 9 study at Londua Presbyterian College, on Ambae.Without hesitation, Seresere and his father swiftly enrolled Roy’s name in Certificate I in Computing.“That’s the great thing about TVET schools,” Seresere recalled. “There are many courses available for everyone. All you would need to do is choose one that best suits your interests.”He completed the course in 2015, and later completed Certificate II in Computing the following year. Roy was also fortunate to undertake afternoon classes in Networking, which also added to his growing skills pocket.As Seresere recalled his journey with VIT, he felt that he made the right choice to enrol in ICT and discover the wonders of computer software and networking.Seresere currently works at VIT as the ICT officer, and available to assist any staff or students with their ICT issues.

With the difficulties that world has faced due to COVID-19 which has severely affected the tourism sector, Vanuatu looks for innovative solutions to help grow our economy.”PM Loughman said he has engaged with the Satoshi Island team and had been given assurance that they now and always, will abide by the laws. Loughman said with the assurance in place, the Government of Vanuatu welcomes the Satoshi Island project and its community to Vanuatu.“We look forward to watching the development of Satoshi Island unfold and invite your community to their new home,” said Mr. Loughman.Welch said there have been quite a lot a lot of developments on Satoshi Island project. He mentioned the PM was kind enough to write them a letter of recommendation. Mr. Welch said this has resulted in major publicity for Vanuatu and Satoshi Island, with over 300 articles being written in major publications worldwide including top papers such as the New York Post and The Sun.He said as of last month, their community now has over 50,000 followers. When Daily Post met with him in Port Vila on Thursday, he added their clients are increasing. Mr. Welch said there are some clients who are interested in buying the Vanuatu citizenship and residency permits. He said those people will take over the employments of the locals but they will give them employment. When commenting on Satoshi Non-Fungible Token (NFT) citizenship, Welch said that they haven’t sold any yet.“They are being released by an overseas company, in order to avoid issues with the VFSC,” he explained.“This is a shame as it is a lost opportunity for Vanuatu, but nevertheless it should have major follow-up for Vanuatu Citizenships and investment, at a time when we need it so much. “We are anticipating an overall investment into Vanuatu over in excess of VT110 billion.

The information is based on the feedback from the shipping lines on their current data.”Aside from the ocean freight costs continuous growth, another thorn in the sides of hardware companies is that cement purposely isn’t given space because it is simply too heavy.“No space has been given to cement because cement container is heavy, one cement container is 27.2 tonnes, one cement container is almost equal to two normal containers,” the Branch Manager of Wilco explained.“For the shipping line, if they drop one cement container they can get two other types of containers that means they can make more money and it’s about the space as well, the cost of the bulk cement can be lower.”The offload and transportation of cement took nearly a week and is expected to be complete by midnight (last night), with 36 20 to 40-ton trucks working 24 hours."

This is an increase of VT22 per Litre from the previous retail price of VT173 per Litre.”The prices are based on the cost fluctuations of the Means of Platts Singapore (MOPS), the regional pricing benchmark adopted in the downstream oil industry, including other cost components, foreign exchange rate, and other charges.The petrol grade dispensed at the pumps is the 95 RON Petrol.The DoE has suggested the following ways to improve fuel efficiency and save money at the pump.Firstly, accelerate and decelerate a little slower. Accelerating a little bit more slowly can improve the fuel economy of a vehicle with no extra cost.The Department advises referring to the manual for best speeds to achieve maximum fuel economy, with less adverse impact on the environment as well.Secondly, anticipating the flow of traffic by looking ahead and planning a trip is recommended.Slow down when reasonable and do not idle your engine for too long.Using a car that is smaller with less mass to move means less fuel to burn per kilometer. Remember to keep the tyres properly inflated.The DoE reminded that a car is designed to be aerodynamically efficient and extras such as roof racks, bull bars and bike bars, etc. will increase the drag.Finally, just getting some of the weight out of the car can make a difference."

The following day, the women in the Italian Parliament came to work wearing jeans in solidarity with the victim andholding placards that read “Jeans: An Alibi for Rape”.Since then, wearing jeans on Denim Day has become a symbol of protest against erroneous and destructive attitudes about sexual harassment, abuse, assault and rape.On Thursday 28th of April, Peace Corps Vanuatu will host another live webinar with support from our Government partners, who are experts intheir fields to speak to thetheme of Staying Safe OnlineDuring Lock Down. Stay tuned for the link, it will be widely advertised and you are welcomed to join the dialog to ask questions to our panelists from CERT Vanuatu, Cyber Crime Unit-Vanuatu Police, Vanuatu Women’s Centre, National Child Social Welfare Department of Community Services, Mental Health unit from the Ministry of Health and Vanuatu Internet Governance Forum.

PVCC and their staffs are working so hard to keep waste management operation in Port Vila City.“JICA wish PVCC will continue to operate the waste management operation with this large capacity excavator and keep the beautiful city, Port Vila clean.”Town Clerk of PVCC, Mr. Peter Sakita said, “PVCC keeps good relationship with JICA for a long time since first Bouffa Landfill Rehabilitation project in 2006.”He added, “JICA and the Government of Japan are continuing assistance to support PVCC. The PVCC Waste Management team must remember that the excavator and other machines must be maintained well for the long-term operation.”Ms Uemura mentioned JICA’s assistance is not only in providing the equipment.“Capacity development is the most important for the cooperation,” she said.“JICA has a scheme to dispatch Japanese experts to Vanuatu and providing training in Japan for PVCC staff for more effective cooperation.“We hope that Japanese experts will come to Vanuatu and also PVCC staff will be able to go to Japan for the training soon, although it will depend on the COVID situation.”JICA is planning to implement the third phase of the J-PRISM III project with PVCC, Department of Environmental Protection & Conservation and Luganville City Council for from 2023 for a period of 5 years."

He is a well-known person who supplies local bread within and outside his community.Mr. Kalsrap and his family have been supplying bread to the community for over 15 years. From the beginning, his bread was initially sold at VT120 then increased to VT150 due to the feedback he gets for his quality bread.The money he earns from making bread helps pay electricity and water bills, and to fulfill his family’s demands. But since last week he was forced to stop baking, because there is no flour. The baker is now focusing more on his garden to provide food for his family.“I pity my customers who come every morning to buy bread,” he said.“However, this situation makes me want to have my own flour stock which will last a year, just in case another similar situation arises in the near future.”A native from Ambrym, Lucy George, has been selling gâteau huit for over 25 years at Ohlen Freshwind. The gâteau huit is priced at VT20 each, thus she makes around VT3,000 a day. Starting two weeks ago, she has switched to sewing to help sustain her family’s needs while waiting for the next supply of flour to arrive in the country.Another senior citizen from Santo, Vekarai Samuel, who is also a longtime gâteau huit seller at Ohlen area said the money she earns helped her family complete a house and also provide food on the table. Most importantly, it also contributed to custom activities and other social activities.Right now, she is selling cooked food at the roadside markets and depending more on her mini shop at home to provide food and bus fare for her children to go to school.“I would like to encourage other local bakers out there to find another way to earn an income while we wait patiently for the next supply of flour,” she said."

Yes, we have heard of allegations of preferential treatments given to some of our Leaders, allegations of some Leaders preaching quarantine protocols and allegations of breeches of basic human rights and so on.While the Head of Transparency International Vanuatu (TIV), Dr. Willie Tokon, is a renowned medical doctor by trade, he says his spiritual faith has always played a leading role in all his decision making in his professional life. For this reason, he believes the global pandemic has been a catalyst for Christians to recognise the basic needs of their next door neighbours and show kindness to conform to ‘love your neighbour as yourself’ in line with Christ’s teaching. Assistance in all forms from well-to-do Leaders, Chiefs, Community Leaders, Church Leaders and support from family leaders must be acknowledged. TIV congratulates all parents for bringing back Family Worship in the home.TIV wishes to share its observations after its members of staff have discussed individual exchanges of how their neighbours are now sharing with each other in the current lockdown.“One of the young men jumped off the bus in my community with 15-kilo bag of rice comprising one-kilo pre-packed plastic bags of rice on his back. While on his way to his door, he opened the bag and started handing out a kilo of rice each to families saying, ‘Cook this for supper,” TIV Advocate Douglas Tamara says.“As men gather for their daily dose of kava at the kava bar in our community, everyone gets ready to go bottoms-up but this evening, the bar owner says, ‘Before we start drinking (our kava), may I ask one of you to bless the evening with a prayer to thank the Lord for being good to us’. We all paused. Someone prayed. This is the first time that anyone has cared to say a prayer before any kava drinking spree here!”Tamara says the virus crisis has impacted his community with so much love and care that it seems everyone has realised the importance of putting God in front of everything.Another member of staff says a senior public servant who used to be ‘in his own world’ has suddenly recognised the grassroot members of his community and now visits with greens and food supplies from the market.Our TIV Media Officer says last week his family was surprised when a Bongo vehicle stopped at their gate and started unloading fresh agricultural produce at their gate. The food supply was so much that they went on to distribute it to 50 households. The recipients were assured that it was “all blessings from God”.Speaking by mobile, the donor asked to remain anonymous saying she felt the urgency to buy all the food from Eton farmers then hired a truck to ask that the food be distributed to people in critical need for food at this time.Then the latest incident impressed then shocked two mothers when they followed their church doctrine to “go to your family”. They took with them seven parcels of ‘namba 8 kato’ – 5 in each. They started distributing for free to the first family. It immediately triggered fiery verbal exchanges between ‘mum and dad and son’ since the boy took more than one.The father threatened the son with a piece of iron rod and the poor boy returned one of the two ‘kato’ he snatched. The mothers ended up leaving 15 ‘kato’ to ease the situation.On hearing the sad report, TIV suspects similar experiences in the grassroot communities where most likely the lockdown is already causing hardship as far as putting sufficient food on the table for every member of the family.Fortunately for ni-Vanuatu, food sharing is an art and has sustained families and tribes for generations. Please keep the practice alive especially now in the current COVID-19 lockdown.Let us continue to work together, share and support each other. Cut out the preferential treatments, bribery and corruption. And may God continue to keep Vanuatu in His bubble of love, care and protection always."

The flour shortage means the bakery has not been in business for about a week, with many customers coming in to ask for bread.“We are expecting the container of flour to come in today but we have not received any flour yet,” she says.Brother bakery is yet to receive flour and is not sure when its customers will be able to buy bread fresh from the bakery again.Shefa Bakery manager, Galinie Jean Louis, confirmed Shefa Bakery has closed in the last week as well.The Shefa Bakery Manager shares that the Bakery makes about 10,000 loaves of bread a week. It has 24 workers that have not been able to work since the bakery has closed saying; “Shefa has an agreement with Chuan, it supplies our flour but as of late they have been shifting the dates for the arrival of flour. We are now expecting our flour on the 18th of November”.Unlike the Brother and Shefa bakeries, La Parisienne maintains its bread production at this time.La Parisienne accounts officer, Karol Nikahi shares that the bakery is maintaining its production of 12,000 loaves of bread weekly.The accounts worker stated the bakery is not facing a shortage in flour at all since it has much in stock and the recent increase in price from VT60 to VT70 per loaf of bread is not due to the flour shortage at all.“The VT10 added to the normal prices is more to do with freight and shipping costs. Importing has become costly and the VT70 price increase is related to that and not the shortage of flour,” Nikahi explained.Among the bakeries, La Parisienne has been the first to shift its prices to accommodate the costs of freight and shipping.While Ah Pow confirms that it still maintains its VT60 per loaf along with Brother and Shefa bakeries. The shortages and costs may soon lead to an increase in the market price of bread completely; as flour is a household staple in the country, similarly so is bread and baked goods."

We own a number of properties in town, a majority shares in the National Bank of Vanuatu (NBV) and 49 shares in UNELCO.“We will also own the project building until when the government pays it off.

These are made with empty plastic bottles with a salbutamol spray attached to a hole made at the bottom of the bottle.This is a mobile, easy access, way for asthma patients to breathe in the medicinal aerosols released by the salbutamol spray as the spacer carries the medicine deeply into their lungs.This makes the spacer an effective treatment of asthma. The doctors are pushing the spacer as treatment in case of a community outbreak of COVID-19 and the nebulizer machine at the hospital will not be functioning as a treatment for asthma.Dr. Atua explains that if a patient has COVID-19, has an asthma attack and uses the nebulizer machine, the machine releases aerosols into the air as well as taints the mask so that everyone will get COVID-19.“We have been encouraging people to use the spacer since 2019. The nurse that helped initiate this in 2019 had made an arrangement with the Vanuatu Beverage to provide us with Water bottles. This is the 3rd year that Vanuatu Beverage has donated water bottles, 200 water bottles for the spacers,” says Dr. Atua.VBL has been an active donor to the VCH and says that it will continue to do so in aid of the work VCH does.Additionally, Dr. Atua emphasizes that the VCH has received many donations to help its work and function acknowledging the donations BSP has made in chairs for the emergency department and the work of Giving hands Vanuatu among the help VCH has received.Giving Hands Vanuatu has aided VCH in preparing a storage area for COVID-19 gear for the nurses and doctors.

Unlike the SME grant of 2020, the SBG of 2021 will be over the course of 8 months, reimbursing the employer 50% of the wage up to maximum of VT15,000 a month per employee.The applications for the SBG and the Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) opened in July of this years and closed on September 30 with over 1,500 business that applied for the grant.The Vanuatu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) had stated that businesses who applied late would not need to worry as all the payments, if the business was accepted for the WSS or SBG, would be backdates to the month of May.VCCI Business Adviser, Joanna Spencer stated; “Businesses will not lose out whether they apply now or in September. They will still be paid for the 8-month period.”This has not been the case for businesses whose applications for the WSS or SBG have been accepted, some business owners share that their businesses have yet to see any outcome of the application they have submitted earlier this year.Obed Daniel Philips is among the many that applied for the SBG. He applied for the business grant 2 weeks after the opening of the application, with the help of VCCI.“Since the application we have not gotten any response at all but many other small businesses share that the payment is only backdated a month,” he said.“If I were to receive word that I would only be receiving 1 month back payment after we were promised to be backdated up to May, I would be very displeased as it cannot possibly sustain my business.”Nancy Alexander is also an SBG applicant who has faced the issue with the 1 month back payment. Her business is among those already approved for the grant but she shares that this is only backdated a month.According to Nancy, the bank statement for the amount put into her businesses account simply states SPG June-July and she cannot yet access her funds as she alleges that the transaction was not clarified by the Ministry of Finance with her bank.“The amount is not what was expected as VCCI had stated we would be covered for 8 months, this amount simply cannot do that,” she said.“We are awaiting a response from the Ministry of Finance as VCCI says it will clarify the reason for these complications.”In attempts to get information from the Ministry of Finance concerning the matter, the Communications officer for the Stimulus team, Lillyrose Welwel stated that any queries following the SBG and the WSS will be clarified at an upcoming signing and press conference that the Minister of Finance will be hosting to give an update.“At the moment, everyone with authority to talk with the media cannot do so until the Minister of Finance gives an official update at this press conference,” she said."

The company has incurred Vt70 million loss since that decision, according to Thode.Early January the management of Chicko Farm destroyed eggs worth of hundreds of thousands of vatu because according to the owner of Chicko Farm, the business was not able to sell out due to importation of eggs by other local by few egg distributors. Chiko Farm have seen a substantial fall in revenue as demand has fallen across the board.The Vanuatu Chamber of Commerce and Industry has just released a report which confirmed that “Chiko were one of the first businesses to be impacted by global shipping disruption, as first they lost 20,000 baby chicks due to difficulties caused by importing during COVID-19, and then there was a three-month delay in their packaging when the Evergreen blocked the Suez Canal.“This led to them being unable to distribute their eggs as normal. Since then, the shipping costs for their other imported goods – most notably feed – have increased by at least a third.“Chiko have reduced production and have roughly halved their staff, and at times have been forced to sell their eggs at a loss. They are preparing plans for being able to continue production if there is an outbreak.”In his 12 years in Vanuatu, Thode said he invested approximately AUD 14 million."

The problem is with the link that came from Wunpuko in north-west Santo and from Malo to west coast Santo.Mr Samuel said the company has sent spare parts to Luganville to replace damaged equipment on the cell tower site in west coast Santo.Mr Kenneth added that mobile coverage from the Digicel Telecommunications had also been down for some years now and people in west coast Santo are no longer using Digicel mobile network.He said it is also critical that the two telecommunications companies maintain their mobile coverage in the area.Brian Winji, the Telecommunications, Radiocommunications and Broadcasting Regulator, said last year the office carried out a coverage and quality audit in Vanuatu to identify areas that are still without coverage.“The good news is that we have all the areas identified and we are working to close the entire gap in Vanuatu with the help of the operators and the government,” he said.Mr Kenneth encourage people in west coast Santo to prepare for disaster as Vanuatu reaches its cyclone season.“Now that we have an issue with mobile coverage, it is important for everyone to get a radio to stay up to date on cyclone information,” he said."

The network will work in conjunction with the existing Interchange Cable Network, pushing bandwidth to every corner of Vanuatu, making it the most effective and affordable solution to provide fast and reliable connectivity to the whole country.Satellite connectivity has changed the face of telecommunications in many remote parts of the planet and is the most suitable solution for Vanuatu due to its many islands spread across large distances where infrastructure is limited.The Vanuatu Government is already one of ICL’s largest customers, and will soon be able to share its bandwidth with Government departments, hospitals, schools and other public institutions across every island.Increased connectivity also opens Vanuatu up to new industries, including data storage, which will diversify the country’s tourism-dependent economy.Once launched in December 2021, the AelanSat service will be available to customers through internet service providers in early 2022."

He says it is a privilege to open this office in just over 15 months. Something he feels is an accomplishment in itself.Finau congratulated Atom Limited for their dedication which resulted in the completion of the building. He also acknowledged Derrick Boudier the architect, he also acknowledged engineers, builders and suppliers who were involved in the construction.Finau says the total cost of construction totaled at VT60 million. He confirms it was paid for totally by revenue generated by the airline.Air Vanuatu was paying VT2 million a month when they were renting in town. Finau says now they will be able to save a lot of money and in under 3 years this new building itself will pay back its own costs.Finau says since 2012 the land was idle for almost 10 years however, today the total value of the land and building sits at VT79 million.Finau explained that today we live in a monumental turning point as COVID-19 requires all airlines to change the way businesses operate.Finau said many airlines struggle to adapt; however, Air Vanuatu tells a different story. He explains that through dynamic staff and support from the government which owns the airline, they can keep their planes flying to keep customers connected.Finau thanked staff for their enthusiasm, and support, he also acknowledges the sacrifices made by staff present and past as it is through those sacrifices that the new headquarters are now standing.Finau said this new headquarters will enhance communication and productivity.Despite the battle scars from COVID-19, Finau says the airline has formed new relations with Solomon Islands, Tonga, Samoa, Tuvalu, and Kiribati.Apart from expanding networks, Finau said they are building a strong local workforce. He said he is privileged to work with a team which uses knowledge for the advancement of the airline.Finau said it is important to develop strategic plans for long term objectives in contrast to band aid solutions which should differentiate Air Vanuatu from their peers. That he believes will make them become international leaders in passenger and cargo transport.With that being said, Finau believes they must identify unserved or underserved routes, find niche markets and create markets of their own. This he feels is in preparation for the demand on key regional and international routes.Finau said they are committed to flying safe and modern aircrafts to make them be the airline of preference, he says they have made arrangements for two brand new twin otters and a Boeing 737-800 which should join the fleet by the first or second quarter of next year.Finau also mentioned new state of the art check in and reservation technology to satisfy customers and plans are also in place for a frequent flyer program for people who travel regularly.Finau also acknowledged the diplomatic representatives of Australia, New Zealand, France and China, who enabled the airline to navigate through these difficult times.Prime Minister believes in growth once borders openPrime Minister Bob Loughman said he believes Air Vanuatu will grow and improve once the borders are open.He said the government made sure the airline operated locally and not be grounded like airlines around the world.Prime Minister Loughman mentioned a Bible story about a farmer who sowed seeds but planted some really deep into the ground. He said the deeply planted seeds grew very well. He believes this story represents preparations in bad times for good times coming.PM Loughman related this to today’s pandemic and says good times are coming and this is the beginning. He also says when good times will come it will help us to also prepare and be ready in case bad times come again in future.He thanked CEO Finau for his persistence and for his firm stand as he says doors would not have opened if no one stood firm.The PM believes this new headquarters is a solid foundation and with that, we should be 2 steps ahead. He also encourages the airline to look at servicing domestic destinations less served.He also thanked Air Vanuatu for dealing well with their creditors as he says these creditors could have grounded the airline. He also thanks financiers for being easy on the airline during these hard times.The PM said everyone keeps asking him when borders will be open but he says it is up to us the people to encourage one another to get vaccinated.He urged everyone to get vaccinated. He said people who think they are medical experts and those who claim they can kill covid with custom, need to put all that and get vaccinated for the common good."

216,https://vbr.vu/news/vfsc-wants-financial-dealers-to-move-onshore/,2021-12-31 04:00:00,VFSC wants financial dealers to move onshore,"Compiled by Germain SamThe Vanuatu Financial Services Commission (VFSC) wants financial dealers to move onshore and invest in communities to create employment.VFSC has imposed significant requirements forVanuatu Financial Dealer License (FDL) holders and one is the physical presence of at least one direct employee in the country.The only exception to the physical presence requirements is small brokers with limited activity will be authorized to designate a Licensed Resident Manager, that is, hire a local consultant, instead of moving onshore.The FDL holders must have three people onshore, one of them is their Chief Technology Officer because he will deal with digital assets.The onshore office would operate with a minimum capital of USD 500,000 (VT56 million) and an established track record as licenses.Chairman of the Financial Markets Association of Vanuatu, Martin St-Hilaire, said the government is prioritizing the local economy.“Our government wants to bring offshore industry back onshore to spur investment in country, create jobs, stimulate further development, and support education and training,” he said.The VFSC has established recently four categories of licenses, foreign exchange deliverable and debt instruments (Cat. A); corporate shares, precious metals or commodities (Cat. B); futures contracts and derivative products (Cat. C); and digital assets (Cat. D.).The new FDLs will never have to be renewed; they will be perpetual with the VFSC reserving the right to revoke them at any time for non-compliance with the law. Existing licensees will have until October 16, 2022 to comply.While the new compliance requirements may deter more than a few brokers from applying for a Vanuatu license that is precisely the goal of the VFSC.“Our regulator wants to attract only the most serious applicants. If they are genuine in their intentions, and dedicated in their approach, and they intend to properly run their business in Vanuatu, the VFSC will be flexible and patient,” St-Hilaire explained.The government has upgraded its monitoring and regulatory systems as well as its legislation, putting them on par with global standards, with the help of the Asia-Pacific Group on money laundering and the Financial Action Task Force.Vanuatu is an active participant in all major global initiatives in the fight against tax evasion, money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and a willing adherent to the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (CRS).“The government wants to bring about a sea change in the way it does business, by transitioning from an offshore, protected financial Centre to an onshore, transparent Fintech centre,” St-Hilaire said."
217,https://vbr.vu/news/local-entrepreneur-opens-takeaway-at-blandinere/,2022-01-04 22:25:00,Local entrepreneur opens Takeaway at Blandinere,"By Hilaire BulePeople in Port Vila call him a ‘Ni-Vanuatu Chinese’, but his real name is Leon Yawah.Mr. Yawah hails from Loutapunga village, Tanna.Yawah is a Ni-Vanuatu who has been competing with the Chinese retail business community in Port Vila for more than three decades. At the age of 17, he started to make “gateau huit” under a tarpaulin at Manples area.“In 1988, I made 20 gateau huit every morning,” he said. “I carried them in a basket and sold them at INTV where I was studying as a mechanic, after completing Grade 1-6 at Loutapunga Catholic Primary School back home.“At the end of my studies in 1989, I was left with VT11,000. This was the remaining money from my gateau huit savings.“I made my first deposit of VT3,000 out of VT11,000 at Indosuez Bank. I continue to cook gateau huit and sell it under the tarpaulin. Shortly after, I bought three metal roofing sheets. The three iron roofing sheets later ended up on a permanent building, which I named Perinoz.”Asked what Perinoz means, he replied, “My father died when I was 5 years old. One night, I dreamed I went into a big building.“I saw my father inside the building and I was told he owned it. I also saw that Perinoz was the name of the building.He said in 1989, there was a business boom and he purchased cargo valued at VT800,000 from Au Bon Marche.Perinoz was thriving until the Chinese expanded their business to Manples and Tebakor, and the shop was rented out. Perinoz is now a Chinese Takeaway.“I bought my first car at the time and used it as taxi,” Yawah continued.On 24th of December 2021, Yawah opened a new shop and takeaway at Blandiniere Estate. He said too many businesses are complaining that there is no money because of the COVID pandemic.The local entrepreneur said if there is no money in Vanuatu, this will be reflected in the national annual budget. He said people talk about tourists but only public transport operators and mostly mothers who sell artefacts to the tourists benefit from foreign visitors, not all locals. He added foreign investors who operate hotels and restaurants benefit more from tourists.“This takeaway is for locals living at Blandiniere and have less money to spend, compared to those who are can afford eating at other takeaways in town,” he said. “A plate of food costs VT250. The price will not change. We cook local food with salad and the price will remain at VT250.”He said since the opening of the takeaway last week, Blandiniere residents bought food there because it is much cheaper for them, compared to buying from a Chinese takeaway for more than VT380 and VT300 bus fare.He said for the time being, he is using local food from his own garden on Efate, but he plans to buy local produces from Tanna in the near future.Yawah also trains his young sons and daughters as chefs and to step in as cashiers.“We have to train our children and teach them practical skills that will help them in the future,” he said."

Currently, the main national goals are, boosting vaccination coverage and preparing the health system.The MOH is working to boost vaccination coverage rate. Regarding clinical preparedness, DG Vira said works to upgrade the country’s main referral hospital, Vila Central Hospital (VCH), to improve its capacity to care and manage COVID-19 patients, is still at the planning stage.He said they are still discussing it and are yet to receive funds for the hospital upgrades.The Minister of Health, Silas Bule, said no health paper was tabled in yesterday’s Council of Ministers (COM) meeting.However, a paper on needed clinical equipment is expected to go before the Development Committee of Officials (DCO) soon before COM, he added."

228,https://vbr.vu/news/kava-quality-begins-at-the-farm/,2022-03-02 23:21:00,Kava Quality Begins at the Farm,"Vanuatu’s Kava Industry continues to rocket as many lead farmers today on the main productive islands of Santo, Pentecost, Malekula, Maewo and Epi continue to increase kava production.Kava is an important crop to Vanuatu for a range of cultural, social and economic purposes and it’s Vanuatu’s green gold.The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s (DARD) Kava Officer, Peter Kwari, said kava is an important cash crop that generates more income in the country, benefiting 75 to 80% of Vanuatu’s population living in the rural areas.“Today, kava is gradually shifting away from traditional use to an economic beverage where most countries in the Pacific are generating more money out of it,” DARD Kava officer Kwari said.“It is essential that the farmers who are always at the frontline, alongside with the buyers and exporters, must ensure to produce good quality kava at all times to meet the requirements of domestic and export markets.“Producing good quality kava begins at the farm, complying with the process of dried kava and green kava before marketing point.“There are certain steps to follow in order to produce top quality kava such as farmers ensuring kava plants are 3-5 years before harvesting, after harvesting, wash kava with clean water, use a clean knife to separate kava parts and well cleaned before cutting into chips. Kava chips should be dried on a well ventilated area or surface.“Farmers can use transparent plastics to build solar drier above the soil, free from animals.“Once kava is well dried, the chips should be white in colour and can be easily crack when break open.“Farmers must ensure that the kava chips are dried up, well stored before buyers can purchase kava.“Vanuatu kava exports have long been considered an important part of the kava industry.”The DARD is encouraging local farmers to plant the noble kava varieties that are already selling at overseas markets.Vanuatu has more than a 100 kava varieties schedule in the Kava Act and the DARD has categorized it into four categories.; Noble Kava, Medicinal Kava, Tudei Kava — also call Two Day and Wild Kava.Vanuatu farmers are well aware of these noble kava varieties.Kava Officer Kwari added that there are ongoing challenges faced by the kava industry.“Despite the challenges such as the high cost of transport and poor road conditions and poor access to production sites and markets, COVID-19 pandemic, poor ship handling, early harvesting, two day kava, distance to the markets, no proper storage facility and poor quality, the income generated from kava has contributed directly to the livelihoods of farmers as an important commercial crop,” he said.“Farmers should respect each other and the buyers and exporters to maintain overseas market.”The DARD is planning to implement priority activities this year to address some of the challenges encountered by local kava farmers.“DARD will be assisting farmers to build proper dryer facilities to ensure farmers produce good quality kava for export.“DARD will be working in collaboration with appropriate authorities to organize trainings to train farmers to produce good quality kava.“When we talk about good quality kava, it all started at the farm. If a farmer does not plant a noble kava variety and is able to export that variety, the farmer is already tarnishing the quality of kava.“So farmers should be very honest about their work at the farm, growing noble varieties of kava so that we can protect Vanuatu kava market.”Kwari concluded, “I would like to advice farmers to treat kava as a beverage drink thus hygiene is paramount and farmers should consider that what they are producing will be consumed by many people at large.”The DARD encourage farmers to use the most appropriate agricultural farming systems that will boost growth rate and ensure kava is free from any diseases such as, Dieback disease.While kava takes five years to harvest, today farmers are more advanced in their knowledge of kava plantation management and understanding of the changing weather pattern to mitigate climate change impacts (high rainfall, drought and pest and disease) and managing their crops well to ensure that their returns from kava are consistent throughout the year."

The Money Minded course was designed specifically for the Pacific audience, taking into consideration the low literacy level, influence of Pacific traditions and cultures on how families earn and spend their income, managing businesses in rural communities.Though Vanuatu will celebrate 42 years of sovereignty independence this year, the sad reality is many Ni-Vanuatu homes today are still struggle to achieve their financial freedom. This is why a Training like Money Minded is deemed super important and is perfectly timed to bridge this gap by equipping participants with financial knowledge and skills. This course also provides walk away resources such as budget templates, vision board paper, and prioritizing needs verses wants cards.These tools will continue to help participants beyond training setting so they continue to apply finance knowledge into everyday living.Wilson reminded participants that coming to training is only 50% of the journey but the other half is when they put into practice what they learnt in training to achieve their financial freedom.ANZ is acknowledged for the Money Minded Training, particularly Mr. Turoa Vatoko for sacrificing his family weekend to conduct this training."

Applications for the 2022 program close on Sunday 13 March.The 16-week program was developed after Pacific Business Monitor research and feedback received from businesses, indicated a growing regionwide interest in developing ecommerce capabilities, accessing new markets and improving technology know-how.With an initial focus on Small Island States, the bespoke Pacific-focused course is now open to business operators from Fiji, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Vanuatu. Participation in the program is free, with each place valued at A$5,500.The start of the program is aptly timed, with the release of the recent PTI Pacific Business Monitor Report, which found that by the end of 2021, nearly one-third of Pacific businesses were seeking to improve their ecommerce capabilities to support their business, and nearly one-quarter were calling for better access to technological upskilling and training.Matisse Walkden-Brown, PTI Australia’s Communications Manager, said that with COVID-19 acting as a technological catalyst for businesses and consumers alike, the need to maintain a strong online presence and digital connection has been highlighted.“With more than half the world’s population using social media, the technology has quickly become a cost-effective and vital business communication tool.,” she said.“Through our research and discussions with businesses, we understand that there is a lack of readily available support for business professionals in the Pacific to learn how to effectively use social media as a powerful marketing tool.“Social media has also become more and more important for direct sales. Ecommerce has been central to business frameworks for years and as internet uptake rapidly increases worldwide, the number of digital consumers continues to climb year on year. Of course, in this new world impacted by COVID-19, the need to be digitally connected has been even further highlighted, and PTI Australia remains steadfast in its dedication to equip Pacific businesses with the best tools and skills to join and thrive in the ecommerce trade.”The unique program is tailored to Pacific businesses and covers social media marketing foundations, free social media growth strategies, and blueprints for profitable social media advertising.Last year saw 65 business professionals selected for the program from across the Pacific, with participants hailing from a range of sectors, including media, tourism, and telecommunications. The cohort completed the bespoke Pacific-focused e-learning course in three learning streams through a mix of online workshops, pre-recorded video modules and an online group discussion space.Leilani N Reklai, publisher and editor of The Island Times newspaper in Palau, said the development program is benefiting her business tremendously.“In the month since I started following the recommendations and posting ads linking my Facebook page with my Instagram, traffic to my website has grown by about 70%,” she said.“There are still a few challenges that, once resolved, will further increase traffic to my business. I own a newspaper, which is also available online. With the world moving more towards online news, our days as print media are numbered. It is critical that we transition to online media and learn how to maximise the tools available in order to do that. This training is what I have been looking for and it has exceeded my expectations. Thank you so much, PTI Australia, for giving me the opportunity through this scholarship! It’s a lifesaver!”Applications for PTI Australia’s Social Media for e-Business professional development scholarship program are now open to business operators in Vanuatu. Participation in the program is free, with each place valued at A$5,500. Applications will close on Sunday, 13th of March 2022."

Our new partnership will address all aviation sectors, such as commercial, regulatory and operations for the progress of aviation in the region,’ said Mr Andrew Valentine, PASO’s General Manager.“Our communique is a first for PASO and PRIF, and I am glad that we have ventured down this path to execute the Regional Ministers’ goals for regional aviation,” said Mr Valentine“We welcome the opportunity to assist PASO implement the RAMM deliverables. Our partnership provides an opportunity for PRIF to contribute to Pacific regional aviation recovery, which is a priority of our development partners,” said Mr Sean O’Sullivan, PRIF Coordination Office Team Leader.A key focus of the new collaboration is producing a COVID-19 impact and recovery assessment for aviation in the Pacific. At the 2021 Regional Aviation Ministers Meeting, Ministers expressed concerns over the impacts of COVID-19 and tasked officials to conduct the impact assessment. PRIF is funding this assessment and is now working in collaboration with Landrum and Brown with the support of PASO.The COVID-19 Impact and Recovery Assessment for Aviation in the Pacific will be presented to Aviation Officials consideration at their next meeting in April."

We are taking action to meet this call by elevating our ambition to $100 billion in cumulative climate finance from our own resources by 2030.”In 2018, ADB committed to ensuring at least 75% of the total number of its operations support climate action and its own climate finance resources reach at least a cumulative $80 billion by 2030. Yesterday’s announcement elevates the ambition of this financing.ADB expects the cumulative climate financing from its own resources in 2019–2021 to reach about $17 billion.The expanded climate finance ambition is a key element of ADB’s efforts to support its DMCs. Facing the interconnected challenges of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the climate crisis, many DMCs are taking bold action to promote a green, resilient, and inclusive recovery.The additional $20 billion will provide support for the climate agenda in five main areas:• First, new avenues for climate mitigation, including energy storage, energy efficiency, and low-carbon transport. ADB expects its cumulative climate mitigation finance to reach $66 billion.• Second, a scale-up of transformative adaptation projects. Projects in climate-sensitive sectors, such as urban, agriculture, and water, will be designed with a primary purpose of effective climate adaptation and enhanced resilience. ADB expects its cumulative adaptation finance to reach $34 billion.• Third, an increase in climate finance in ADB’s private sector operations. This includes creating more commercially viable projects for both ADB and private investors. The expansion will be underpinned by improvements in operational efficiencies, a post-pandemic recovery in market demand for financing, new technologies and innovations in climate financing, and new areas of business for private sector climate operations. ADB intends to support these initiatives with $12 billion in cumulative private sector climate finance from its own resources and anticipated crowding in of an additional $18 billion to $30 billion.• Fourth, support for a green, resilient, and inclusive recovery from COVID-19, including through innovative financing platforms such as the ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility and Green Recovery Platform, which are expected to leverage funds from capital markets and private sector investors for low-carbon infrastructure.• Fifth, support to advance reforms in DMCs to unlock actions through policy-based lending to support policies and institutions for enhanced climate resilience and climate mitigation.Across these areas, ADB will continue to expand access to new, climate-focused technologies and mobilize private capital toward climate finance."

Monitoring results and the types and costs of accommodation for students abroad are issues which need to be addressed, stressed the VNPF General Manager (GM), Parmod Achary. “The problem we had is that, there has been no monitoring of students’ results and we are not sure of where they were staying, whether the accommodations are safe and not overcrowded,” he said.“Another issue is not paying tuition on time. Students SOL accounts are usually placed on hold when we do not pay fees on time. This can result in students missing out on lectures and assignments.“It’s important that we (VNPF) get the accommodation and tuition fee invoices on time, to avoid threats or evictions by the landlords.“VNPF and the University of the South Pacific (USP) cannot be blamed for the deactivation of students’ SOL accounts. “The students have the responsibility to provide us the invoices immediately once they secured accommodation and enrolled for courses.“Normally under MESS, the pre-departure briefings are done by the Ministry of Education. Now VNPF will do it and will be able to outline this to the students.“In terms of the results, they will have to provide them to us before proceeding to the next semester.” GM Achary said VNPF will be sorting this out now that it will be operating the scheme independently, under the new name ‘Student Education Support Scheme’ (SESS). Under the loan scheme, students will be dealing directly with VNPF. Current students will be transferred to the new scheme.According to the GM, VNPF has already settled the VT32 million tuition outstanding for students at USP Emalus Campus in Port Vila."

Their main objective is to promote the social and economic interests of its members in accordance with cooperative principles.PCREEE is was established by the Pacific Ministers of Energy and infrastructure and Transport as a regional center for excellence operating under the Pacific Community (SPC).The center assists the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) to address existing barriers and strengthen drivers for sustainable energy markets, industries and innovation. PCREEE is co-hosted by the SPC and the Government of Tonga.The NGEF is a national vehicle designed to assist the Government to achieve the NERM targets through investment in renewable energy technology and infrastructure across Vanuatu while the Vanuatu Rural Electrification Project Phase 2 (VREP 2) is a project that aims to set standards in the solar systems as well providing a 33% subsidy to certified systems to address affordability.The VREP 2 project targets off-grid areas, or areas with no existing power supply.This project will be implemented through collaboration between the National Green Energy Fund (NGEF), the Vanuatu Rural Electrification Project (VREP), PCREEE and the NSCL.Charlie Namaka, a member of NSCL talked about the establishment of NSCL. “The NSCL cooperative was established in 2009, with the initial idea of developing a savings and loans cooperative, intended to financially help the members of the cooperative. In the beginning of 2021, the members decided to open up the society to non-members.“In August 2021, the NSCL bylaw was amended so to expand its products and services which includes providing loan to non-members.”“When we found out about the funding, we talked about how we could support the local entrepreneurs and disadvantaged people living in the rural and remotes part of Vanuatu.“Because it relates to energy, we know that energy is the catalyst of development, so we incorporated the two,” Joseph Temakon, another member of NSCL explained.It has been agreed that NSCL subsidize the costs of renewable energy for Clients who wish to invest on system from VREP 2. VREP2 will commit its 33% contribution to the system costs. There is an annual interest of 6% for NGEF.“We target renewable energy. Interested customers or clients will have to deposit 20% of the cost of the system with us. With the funding from PCREEE, the NSCL will put another 20%, and release the loan in the form of a solar system with a particular productive use equipment, e.g. sewing machine, freezer, virgin oil grinder, water pump or any other money making device.”Any interested individual who fits the Client definition may apply, but conditions do apply.Government workers are more preferred to apply, as the NSCL have direct links to their payments or salaries for security purposes.If a person does not work for the government, but has a close relative who is a government employee, and they agree to sign the guarantee, then they can be given a loan."

The students will be applying directly to VNPF,” he said.“The system will be a loan scheme with an interest rate different to previous 4% and under our requirement. The only difference is that, we will not be able to pay allowance, only tuition and accommodation.“Existing recipients of MESS will be transferred to the new scheme.“We will be focussing on existing and new teachers, accountants, agricultural, pilots, nurses and doctors, as the priority human resources that the country needs.”GM Achary further clarified a misconception among members about MESS. “Firstly, Section 44 (A) of the VNPF Act allows VNPF to introduce schemes like MESS, through microfinance model,” he explained.“What people are forgetting is that VNPF has been providing education support scheme since the existence of the Member Financial Services Ltd (MFSL).“In 2019, MoET wanted to be part of it and we thought would be better for the organising of the scheme in terms of coordination. The VNPF Act allow us to use MoET as an agent and the MOU was a guide us to set up the boundary.“A lot of concerns have been raised about consultation.“It is not a scheme for everyone. It is a business. What kind of consultation do we need to do a business? It’s business where we want to do profit and have the profits transferred to our members.“The support has been there for so long.“What we did was enlarge the boundary. We are not forcing members to borrow for their children’s education.“If you do not want to use the scheme, then don’t apply. Those who are participating now, it’s their choice. They have money in their accounts.”Achary said the Student Education Support Scheme will be operating under Members Benefit, not MFSL anymore.MESS has supported over 1,000 students last year and this year at vocational institutions and universities in Vanuatu and abroad."

In the weeks in which Unity Airlines had no flights due to the shortage, the company scrounged up enough fuel for the medevac.Lenakel hospital Medical officer, Dr. Geraldine Nimissa said the flight that took place on the 13th of September. Anna Kaim, a 30-year-old mother and 40-year-old Susan Jonas would not have survived if they had remained at Lenakel Hospital.Dr. Nimissa reported that it was later discovered at the Vila Central Hospital (VCH) that Anna had an intraabdominal pregnancy and she was continuously losing blood and bleeding internally.Delivery was impossible for Susan Jonas as the baby lied transversely and keeping them at the Lenakel hospital would have put both mother and baby’s life at risk“If Anna was kept overnight at Lenakel hospital she would not have made it, but at VCH she was immediately taken to theatre and it was a long operation,” Dr. Nimissa said.“The patient is well and is slowly recovering post operation. Susan is awaiting a cesarean section later on this week.”According to CEO Deamer, the Mercy flight was arranged by Dr. Nimissa, working with the Ministry of Health (MOH). The flights to Tanna usually are one hour each way. In this case, the approval from MoH came in very late in the day, normally Unity Airline flights would not have left so late.“The fuel shortage in Vila meant we had to refill the aircraft on Tanna from a drum of fuel, before we could put the two mothers to be and a nurse on the plane to come back to Vila,” the CEO said.“We departed Tanna just a few minutes before the last flight on the day,” says Mr Deamer. The Tanna runway has no lighting.Dr. Nimissa and the Lenakel Hospital greatly appreciated the work Unity airlines had done, resulting in saving the lives of the women and their babies. The Dr. highly recommended the airline.The Chief Pilot of Unity Airline, Sebastien Lamoureux said Unity airlines was happy to use their last stock of fuel at the time to save lives as both cases were deemed urgent.“Unity Airlines is delighted to have been able to assist which resulted in a happy ending. Our thoughts went towards people living on islands outside of our coverage areas who needed urgent care before the fresh stock of AVGAS had arrived,” he said."
244,https://vbr.vu/news/inflated-cement-prices-triggered-by-freight-charges/,2021-11-23 00:10:00,Inflated cement prices triggered by freight charges,"By Germain SamInflation is here and the recent increase of the price of cement is a precursor of what is to follow.A bag of cement use to cost VT980, now with the border closure it costs VT1,595, that’s a 62% increase on each bag.The General Manager of Transam Vanuatu Shipping, Stephen Blade, explained that the shortage of goods and the increase of price is due to COVID-19.The cancellation of flights put pressure on shipping routes. The shipping companies increased the freight charges and overflows to inflated charged and imported goods.The manager attributed two reason for the increase — the shipping cost and a decrease of production in China. The shipping cost is increasing due to delay from the suppliers in China.When the ships arrived at China they have to wait until the suppliers of products load the ships and it could take two or three weeks. While in China, the shipping agency is responsible for electricity, water and wharf costs.All the delay of shipping cost hits directly the price in Port Vila. The second reason is when the factories of cement and flour could not produce enough quantity of cement or flour due to lack of employees. The employees are exposed to COVID-19 and they can contract the virus easily.When there is a case on the vessel, the ship must cease operation and get to quarantine. All the risk shipment companies took could affect a full chain of operation and lead to a shortage of goods.SHEFA Cooperative Business officer, Nic Oli, held that business houses might take advantage of the pandemic situation to increase good price so they could make more income.“Some of the shops in Port Vila, especially hardware technically control their stock by increasing the good prices in order to maintain their stock until the arrival of the new stock,” he said.According to the Transam GM, one cannot blame the shipping companies, the factories, the middle men and the government, they just doing their best ways to make sure every people in the chain of production is served.It is a global issue and it affects every country, not only Vanuatu.Lucien Nirambath, a senior compliance officer and economist at the Prime Minister’s Office explained the market law. “When the demand is high and the offer is low, the price increases,” he said.The inflation affects all the economic levels and what could be frightening is when it hits food prices. The local supply of food is not enough to meet the people’s primary needs and it is a very important issue to deal with before that happens."

This is planned to change to a fortnightly run early 2022.”The Air Vanuatu CEO also expresses pride in the history that Air Vanuatu made in May of this year by flying to China for the first time ever.This has resulted in new business opportunities as the company is being considered for further charter flights.“CCECC has over 500 project workers throughout the Pacific region. With Vila as the quarantine hub, we will distribute workers to their project locations around the region and then return them to China once their projects are completed,” Finau explained.Regional collaboration has also allowed Air Vanuatu to generate income it has provided Kiribati with a repatriation flight.With the report of the work that Air Vanuatu has been doing over the year, it is no surprise that the company was able to bring in a revenue of VT1.2 billion between January and September of this year as announced by the Minister of Finance, Johnny Koanapo in parliament."

Minister Koanapo explained that the 10% increase is to address the consumption of instant noodles which are contributing to NCDs in Vanuatu. For instance, the Maggi noodles which is being imported from Fiji is being excluded from the increase. “But we have an existing excise tax on Maggi Noodles, which is VT20 per kilogram,” Koanapo explained.Each year, Vanuatu imports about 742 tonnes of noodles, worth around VT142 million.Currently, with the importation of noodles outside of the MSG agreement, duty targets 261 tonnes of noodles in a year. “We will see an increase of VT8.4 million on top of the current collections,” the Finance Minister said.Meanwhile, while the government increases tariff on noodles, it has also substitute it by decreasing duty on healthy snacks such as cereals.The MPs have further imposed import duty rate of 40% on nicotine and tobacco products, which is also contributing to the NCDs in Vanuatu.Products containing tobacco, reconstituted tobacco, nicotine, or tobacco or nicotine substitutes, intended for inhalation without combustion; other nicotine containing products intended for the intake of nicotine into the human body"
248,https://vbr.vu/news/pacific-forum-on-business-and-human-rights/,2021-11-23 00:15:00,Pacific Forum on Business and Human Rights,"By Len GaraeDirector and Spokesperson for Women Against Crime and Corruption (WACC) and Member of Diplomacy Training Programme (DTP) Alumni Network in the Pacific, Jenny Ligo, has assured partners who have been invited to the training sessions at the Grand on Monday this week, to know that they have been invited based on their expertise and experience as Human Rights Defenders and Advocators.She is confident that during the three-day sessions which opened yesterday, the participants are contributing meaningfully to formulate a firm statement from November 22nd to 23rd at The Grand. The 24th session will be held at Golden Port Hotel at the top of the hill.Asked how WACC is linked to the United Nation’s 2nd Forum on Business and Human Rights, Mrs. Ligo says linking with her is not something new because UN Human Rights Linkages are already in place in the Region.The Founder of WACC is a member of the Diplomacy Trading Programme Alumni Network in the Pacific. As such she accepted the invitation to participate in the Vanuatu Hub and quickly networked with her Partners including Dr. Andrina Thomas and Manina Pakete and a string of prominent women and men to attend the Diplomacy Training Programme.“I have decided to accept it to be held here because we feel that our human rights record in the country needs to be revisited. Various sectors of development are taking place but what we want to see is fairness, gender equality and transparency in all recruitment programmes,” she said.“Let me be clear that we who are active today are volunteers and are committed in our programmes because we believe in what we do to contribute towards a better work environment where everyone respects one another while we collaborate to work against discrimination, towards achieving fairness, unity, peace and prosperity in our country.”She is appealing to the Government to see them not as “attackers” but collaborators to help achieve the Goals of its National Development Plan.“Our focus nationally remains the same; to work against corruption while ensuring that people’s human rights are not abused but respected,” she said.Dr. Thomas has been invited to work with Ligo to coordinate the Second Pacific Forum on Business and Human Rights. “In the Pacific we have the Vanuatu Hub and Solomons Hub, while Fiji and PNG remain Virtual Hubs,” she said“UN wants us to mobilise our professionals to contribute our ideas towards a set lists of topics towards UN’s Guiding Principles.“But before that we are with WACC to advocate against Crime and Corruption, to advocate for good governance principles for use in our workplaces.“We also work as Human Rights Defenders. The role of human rights defenders and national human rights institutions are very important, to ensure that the Government recognizes what we strive to achieve”.Dr. Thomas says it is clear that in some countries, discrimination is a common practice. “While in Vanuatu, we can say there is no active discrimination but there are issues in place, and one of them which Mrs. Ligo and I worked on several years ago, referred to alleged corruption in recruitment into the Public Service. We were manhandled and taken to the police station. Even though we reported the case to the Ombudsman’s Office, nothing has happened”.She said this is one case that can be included in the list to the UN to see how it can be resolved, to help WACC to ensure that good governance always prevails.The topics to be discussed during the sessions include Land and Territorial Issues, Climate Change and Environment, Reaching Net Zero, Mandatory Human Rights Defenders and Access to Remedy, Extractive Industries, Diversity, Gender, Inclusion, Labour, Decent Work, Modern Day Slavery and Technology, Digital Space and Artificial Intelligence and so forth,All the topics have been selected for their relevance to the Pacific Region and Vanuatu.Pakete says the void regarding lack of women’s political representatives in Parliament remains their concern. “Not having a female voice in parliament is tragic especially when any wrong decision remains wrong for four years and women suffer as a result,” she said.“Increasing challenges facing our young people remain untouched especially with unemployment, teenage pregnancies and a seeming lack of concern for them is alarming especially when our leaders keep labeling them the ‘future of tomorrow’.“Youth have skills that are not made use of. We hear of so much money coming in to develop the country. Where has the money been diverted to? Why not put the money in the horse’s mouth? We’ve come 41 years without resolving our problems. What people want is not how many millions of vatu that come in but where it is spent to help them to improve their lives. This is where human rights come. People are not even aware that their rights have been breached. This issue is frightening, it is a sleeping giant“Undoubtedly this is the right time for all our partners to attend these three days of meetings to brainstorm to draw up the right programme to set our human rights challenges in focus to find the answers to help our young people”."

At the end of 2020, over 180 countries and regions are conducting Chinese language education, more than 70 countries have included Chinese language education in their national education system. Over 20 million people out of China are learning Chinese language.”He said in 2019, Mandarin was designated as the first foreign language to be taught in schools and for that reason, three Chinese teachers are now working in Vanuatu. The Chinese Ambassador said many parents believe that learning Chinese will help their children develop successful careers and more and more young Ni-Vanuatu citizens have approached the USP Confucius Classroom and join their peers to learn Chinese.“We are glad the see that Vanuatu’s “China Craze” is ascendant,” he said. “We are so impressed by the enthusiasm of Ni-Vans students’ for the Chinese language and culture, the great progress they have made and their eagerness to learn more.”Studying in China has become a top choice for students in Vanuatu. Altogether, 199 Chinese government scholarships have been awarded to Vi-Vanuatu students since 1995. Facts showed that studying in China will open a new chapter for the life of young Ni-Vanuatu which will equip them with knowledge and skills acquired, help them grow to be the pillars of Vanuatu national development and good-will ambassadors for China-Vanuatu relations.Mr. Zhou said China will continue to support Chinese language teaching in Vanuatu, offer more practical and effective support within their means and promote China-Vanuatu educational cooperation and comprehensive strategic partnership to new heights.Minister of Education, Samson Samsen, was at Vila Central School to receive the computers and handed them to the administration of the school. Mr. Samsen took the occasion to thank the government of China for his donation."

It continues to make payments to its other creditors,” the Finance Minister said.“The company is still not free from debts, but I believe it is doing its best to recover its debts.”Minister Koanapo conveyed that a contract was to be signed for the government to inject over VT200 million into Air Vanuatu, to sustain the airline’s continuous flights to destinations abroad.He revealed that the government will renegotiate the Airbus A220 Purchase Agreement committed by the previous Air Vanuatu Board, following the Commission of Inquiry (COI) into the matter.“As revealed by the report, that type of aircraft is not fit for purpose in the region but we went ahead to make a commitment thus, we must face its consequences.“The amount of money committed to the Airbus deal was more than an annual government budget. It was not a really good deal and we must find a way to negotiate our way out of it.“The government is trying to renegotiate the deal. With the permission of the shareholders, I as the Minister of Finance, assigned Technical Adviser — Jean Paul Virelala, to negotiate if it is possible for us to use that money to purchase two ATR aircrafts instead of Airbuses.“The ATR aircrafts are more appropriate for us. We want our domestic company to fly regional routes and offer shares.“We have never owned an aircraft. We must change our mode of operation instead of continuing to lease aircrafts.”One of the recommendations given by the COI into the purchase of the four A220 airbuses, is to negotiate an acceptable exist from the Airbus contract.Air Vanuatu signed the purchase agreement with Airbus Canada in 2019, making it the launch customer of A220 in the Pacific region. Almost VT2 billion has been committed by the government for the arrangement.The first aircrafts which were expected last year have not arrived yet."

Much like Vanuatu’s customary celebration of the Yam harvest. Being German herself, the idea came to her that Oktoberfest would be a wonderful annual event that would attract tourists to visit Vanuatu, once borders open. It is celebrated all over the world.For this year, the event is creating extra revenue for ten different businesses that would otherwise not have been earned. Red is working with two local bakeries to make German baked goods never seen here in Vanuatu, along with other suppliers for plenty of delicious dishes. Bratwurst, sauerkraut and schnitzels go without saying, all washed down with very large glasses of beer.The Grand Opening for Oktoberfest is 11am on Saturday the 13th, supported by the VMF Band, who are now busy learning five traditional German songs for the occasion.Red said the VMF were very impressed with their sense of responsibility as it is an Adults Only event.“We also want the community to know that we are totally aware of the current health situation,” she said.“Therefore, tickets are very limited for each session. We don’t want to pack people in like sardines.

It enables service providers to cover a myriad of use cases in a single return link without making tradeoffs between speed, efficiency and scale lowering their total cost of ownership.Kacific operates over 8,000 terminals, including the new cost-effective MDM2010 modems in Mx-DMA MRC mode, spread across 56 beams. The technology will allow access to an abundance of use cases across multiple markets, including underserved communities, businesses, and public institutions as well as 3G and 4G cellular backhaul services across the Asia-Pacific region. This allows Kacific to use a single return technology for the majority of its customers’ use cases, and quickly expand to more customers in underserved areas due to better efficiency, scale and operational simplicity.Mx-DMA MRC enables Kacific to scale its services while simplifying operations by optimizing the network bandwidth in real-time, utilizing self-organizing frequency plans that largely simplify network planning and eliminate the need for upfront traffic characterization or pre-configurations. As Mx-DMA MRC scales in MHz, it is independent of the number of terminals used in the network. Kacific can now offer the highest level of intelligent, real-time bandwidth allocation at SCPC efficiencies while maximizing the utilization of available bandwidth resources and delivering the best Quality of Experience (QoE). The new protocol fuels Kacific’s capabilities, driving connectivity in regions and making it the largest regional Ka-band broadband network.“We first introduced Mx-DMA back in 2014 as a response to the MF-TDMA versus SCPC dilemma that many of our customers face. Mx-DMA MRC builds on that legacy and takes it to another level,” said Bart Van Poucke, Vice President of Products at ST Engineering iDirect. “We are proud that Kacific has become one of the early adopters of this technology. This will enable them to unlock tremendous flexibility and scale, open up opportunities and allow them to deliver a broader range of service levels at a lower cost structure without compromise. We are constantly committed to bringing innovation like this to the market, delivering industry-leading technology that protects our customers’ investments well into the future.”“The efficiency of the MRC technology allows Kacific to deliver affordable price points and return speeds on small consumer-type VSAT terminals at a magnitude better than any other system,” said Cyril Annarella, Chief Operating Officer at Kacific Broadband Satellites Group. “Whether in suburban, rural, or fringe and remote areas, we help businesses, governments and communities fully participate in the digital world.”"

It was argued that his action indirectly affected the Ombudsman’s investigation and also resulting to all witnesses of prosecution losing their jobs with VNPF.In her ruling, Acting Chief Magistrate Anna Laloyer, said: “Prosecution could not secure a conviction on that count alone.“The Court is of the view that the defendant was the VNPF GM and the meeting of August 27 is fundamental to take place after the search warrant was executed on. The Defendant was frustrated but it is reasonable. “A copy of the search warrant was on social media. It was reasonable for the GM to protect the integrity of the VNPF at that time and the private phone collected was to monitor the social media.“The Ombudsman’s investigating officer had on his own initiative decided not to collect further information from VNPF staff. As stated earlier, the test for prosecution in establishing a crime is at its highest standard and less standard of evidence would surely end in a no case to answer as stated.“Having said this, the Court grants the Defendant’s application for a no case to answer, in respect to one count of improper influence, contrary to section 48 of the Ombudsman Act. The Defendant is hereby acquitted accordingly.”In regards to the charge of Preservation of Secrecy, the Court dismissed the application for no case to answer.After considering Mr. McGarry’s evidences and the submission of defence and prosecution, the Court was satisfied that the Prosecution evidence could secure a conviction on one count of Preservation of Secrecy.According to the oral ruling, evidence from the Prosecution established a copy of the search warrant issued on Daily Post after an interview between Mr. McGarry and the Defendant while the Ombudsman’s investigation was still ongoing.It was argued that GM Achary exposed the search warrant, despite being informed during the search not to disclose information about it."

He misappropriated over VT7 million from the Lenakel Branch from 2011 to 2013 and over VT4 million from the Aniwa Branch during that same period.Iausalok was initially suspended and later terminated in 2013. Currently, he is unemployed with three children and has a pregnant wife.The maximum sentence for the offence is 12 years’ imprisonment. Having considered the aggravating aspects, Supreme Court Judge Gus Andrée Wiltens gave Iausalok a starting point of 7 years.There were no mitigating factors.Aggravating aspects include the repeat nature of dishonest conduct, the enormous sum misappropriated -over VT10 million, duration of offending-26 months gross breach of trust, the unlikelihood of reparation and planning and pre-meditation.His sentence was reduced due to his early guilty plea and his admissions to the police and the VPL’s Chief Financial Officer.His personal factors such as being unemployed with three children and a pregnant wife, having no previous convictions and willingness to participate in a custom reconciliation ceremony, were considered.Judge Wiltens stated: “There has been considerably delay in the progress of this case. Mr Young (counsel for the Public Prosecutor) accepts that the prosecution is responsible for 5 years delay, and he attributes the other delay at least partly for Mr. Iausalok.“Any unnecessary delay is unfair and that should be reflected in a reduction of sentence. In this case, I reduce the sentence starting point by 4 months to reflect this unnecessary delay.“For his personal factors, the sentence start point is further reduce by 4 months.”The offending is too serious to contemplate suspension of sentence, Judge Wiltens added.Mr. Iausalok has 14 days to appeal, commencing from October 6 last week."

Some estimate that about 3,000 companies like us exist worldwide and they serve about 10,000,000 customers.“In 2021, Titan FX averaged 5,000 customers placing 100,000 orders every single day on our main platform.“Since Titan FX started in 2014, we have been recognized in our industry as an honest, efficient, and reliable online broker, with outstanding customer support.“Our main competitors are spread globally and they target the same global clientele as us through the Internet. As we have access to the same cloud-based technology, we are not disadvantaged despite being physically far from the main active market.”Donna Titi, Head of Compliance said it wasn’t always the case, but today Vanuatu has a regulatory framework that’s both flexible for financial traders and very tough for financial criminals. That’s a good thing if one wants to see more businesses like Titan FX grow the local fintech sector.“Our compliance team is already the biggest in Vanuatu, and we will keep growing. Our job is to make sure Titan FX adheres to all domestic and international regulations,” Titi stressed.She continued, “As one of the 126 financial dealers licensed by the Financial Services Commission, we must report to the Financial Intelligence Unit and we are subject to Vanuatu’s AML-CFT Act. “And we need to meet the international requirements in the global fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism – also called AML-CFT.“It’s important to note that our service is limited to online trading and nothing else; we do not give financial advice, nor allow the transfer of funds between parties.“This makes Titan FX much less at risk to be used by financial criminals than traditional financial institutions that are processing payment and facilitating inward and outward transactions with third parties.”James Hudson, General Manager said because Titan FX serves a global clientele, 100% of their proceeds come from abroad and “we can say with confidence that we bring wealth to Vanuatu.”Hudson continued, “We are investing part of our profits here. Titan FX sponsors many community initiatives in five strategic areas: Sports, Health, Education, Civic life, and Entrepreneurship. One of our biggest projects is to set up a computer coding school using a concept called CodeBoxx. It’s a 16-week Bootcamp to learn all the important basics with experienced teachers. After that, the students can complete their training and start a career in IT, some with Titan FX.“We want to keep doing more and more for the community, not only because it’s our duty as responsible corporate citizens but also because this is where we live with our families.”Martin St-Hilaire, Managing Director highlighted that Titan FX is the living proof that a local business can compete and win on the global stage in a cutting-edge industry. Our local operating expenses are about 200 million per year.“Now, imagine if there were 5 or 10 more fintech companies like ours combined spending would have a huge multiplier effect on the local economy.“It would provide world-class work experience to young Ni-Vanuatu graduates. Those who study abroad will be able to come back and start a fintech career here. And ten years later, they will have enough experience to train the next generation. And that’s how you create a whole new industry that’s competing on the world stage.“Titan FX embodies what can happen when the private sector, the regulators and the government work together collaboratively. We must keep going. When we work together, we can help move Vanuatu forward.”"

However, if parties insist on its continuation, they must seek approval from the Council of Ministers (COM).The second recommendation is for VNPF to continue its support for current recipients but avoid new recipients until the scheme is properly set up.Also, the MoET should concentrate on government scholarships and leave MESS to VNPF under its commercial arrangement.These recommendations were made following the Ombudsman’s investigation into whether MESS was established in accordance with the Government Act [CAP243].Investigations focussed on the conducts of the MoET and VNPF, the then Minister of Education, officials of the ministry involved, General Manager of VNPF and Board Members.When talking about the main findings of the investigation yesterday, Ombudsman Bulu revealed that the then minister was so focussed on the objective of the scheme that he became “careless and negligent”.“He is required under the Government Act to take MESS, as a significant policy, before the cabinet for approval. He has failed to comply with the law when introducing MESS,” the Ombudsman said.“The then Minister and MoET failed to carry out consultations with stakeholders and to obtain approval from the Council of Ministers (COM), breaching requirements of the Government Act.“The VNPF GM failed to consult members and other stakeholders before finalising the MESS Policy. The board as the trustee of the fund has obligation to act honestly, responsibly and in good faith in every decisions and actions.“The lack of proper consultation with stakeholders and agreeing to internal policies and guidelines with MoET to guide MESS implementation, in my view, breach the duty of care for the board as trustee of the fund.”Investigations further reveal MESS was not approved by the Development Committee of Officials (DCO) and the Council of Ministers (COM).Under MESS, students are offered with a loan to meet financial needs and will repay with an interest rate once they complete studies and secure employment.VNPF is covering most of the expenses for students eligible for the Vanuatu government scholarship scheme-tuition fee, airfares and accommodation, while the National Scholarship Office is providing allowances under the scheme.The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) formalizing the establishment of MESS was signed by the former Education Minister, Jean Pierre Nirua and VNPF GM, Parmod Achary, early last year.The Ombudsman concluded in its investigation that the MOU is invalid, as it was enforced in breach of the requirements of Government Act.The investigation report is available at the Ombudsman Office for public."

What we’re trying to do is commercialize the supply chain, getting products more cost effectively to and from the Outer Islands and also support our Agricultural Producers getting their products to market.“If we can increase containerized goods we can also build more export opportunities, via both IPDS and NISCOL operations as well. To date, we have touched 12 of the 83 Islands with Containers from Tafea to Torba, ranging from Project Support to General Cargo Operations and we currently do regular runs to Tanna, Port Vila, Malakula and Santo, but let us know if you’ve got freight because we have a Landing Craft and other barges as well,” says SSC Manager, Anthony Tonner.SSC Director John Tonner, adds the arrival of this latest truck in the fleet comes at a critical time for the company.“With the National Economic Recovery Plan focused on the Agricultural Sector, the Team is running hard to support the efforts by Producers to increase production and marketability of their crops,” he says.“The Vanuatu Government has assisted our latest investment expansion with Import Duty Exemptions and that’ll directly assist supply chain solutions to the Outer Islands.“Safety and Environment are very important to our organisation and by utilizing the containers we are also moving Diesel Fuel and other Bulk Products safely and with greater environmental protection. We’re in this for the long run so providing improved cost-effective services to remote communities and protecting our Island Paradise are foundation objectives of our everyday focus.“Steelbro, a container handling company in New Zealand, have also been vital empowering us to achieve this expansion by supplying us with our latest truckmounted Sidelifter and have been with us through our journey from the beginning, and we still have a way to go yet. Steelbro were very supportive by tailor-making solutions to meet our needs and always going above and beyond to assist us, ensuring we can always rely not only on their products, but also on their service.“One of South Sea Cargo’s most adhered to rules is the safety of those working with and around us, and the greatest way in which we can ensure we achieve this is through the safety of our tools and equipment.

It also emphasizes the need to increase diversity in leadership to optimize economic growth and the private sector’s capacity to lead economic recovery from COVID-19—a focus of PSDI’s work in the Pacific.The report finds that the Pacific compares favourably with global averages in many measures of business leadership. Women hold 21% of board seats and 11% of board chairs in the Pacific, well above the global averages of 16.9% and 5.3%, respectively. Women also hold 13% of chief executive officer (CEO) positions in the Pacific, but only 4.4% globally.The percentage of women in leadership roles varies considerably by country and sector. The Cook Islands, Palau, Samoa, and Tuvalu stand out as having higher proportions of women directors and CEOs than most countries in the region. When the data is examined by sector, tourism leads the way as the only sector to exceed the Pacific regional average in every category of leadership. In the region’s private sector tourism organizations, women comprise 18% of board chairs, 60% of deputy chairs, 28% of directors, and 50% of CEOs.“Although the Pacific is doing well compared to global averages, it is important to remember that these low global figures reflect ongoing and widespread inequalities,” continued Ms. Boxall. “What needs to be strived for is equal representation in leadership in all countries and in all sectors.”To guide the development of evidence-based policy that encourages and supports women’s business leadership, the report offers a comprehensive set of recommendations aimed at cultivating a better understanding of the structural barriers faced by women; establishing supportive policies, practices, and incentives; and monitoring women’s representation in leadership over time.PSDI supports the Asian Development Bank’s 14 Pacific developing member countries to improve the enabling environment for business and to achieve inclusive, private sector-led economic growth, including through reforms designed to enhance the economic empowerment of women."

The private sector has the innovation, the tools and the financing to support our development aspirations as individual nations and together as a region.“They are also a source of employment, so contribute to the social stability of any country. They can also be an agent of change for possible cutting-edge solutions.“Our presence here is our commitment to exploring these opportunities together in ways and means that do unlock those possibilities.”This is the second meeting for Melanesia’s sub-regional private sector workshop on accessing climate finance after the first meeting was convened in Port Moresby, PNG, in 2018."

We are looking at the option of securing an anchored tenant.”GM Achary said VNPF is exploring other options of reviving the investment.He said they will relook into the proposal of making the former Club Vanuatu become the new home for NBV.Purchased at Vt300 million, former Club Vanuatu building is one of the handful of VNPF’s failed investments. It has not been generating revenue since it was approved by the VNPF Board in 2013.Reviving VNPF’s failed investments to bring back lost funds owed to the members has been a main priority of the current VNPF management and board.Other investments considered non-performing and / or under-performing by the Commission of Inquiry includes Wilco Properties, VNBR, Customs land- Koyama ,Pekoa Land, Nambatu Lagoon Property, Interchange Ltd, Egan Land and Banian Subdivision (Santo), Bouffa Limited, Milai Farm, Nasama Resort, CL Agencies, NBV Building and NBV Shareholding, Bouffa Ltd, SPOL Equity and SPOL Vanuatu Venture (Shark Bay) A few of them have been revived by the current VNPF Management and Board"

A married couple can obtain these passports – holders can obtain visitor visas upon arrival in 123 countries, according to Vanuatu Immigration and Passport Services – for as little as US$150,000 plus fees.“A real estate option could make Vanuatu citizenship even more appealing by enabling one to invest in an asset ratherthan simply handing over a fee,” said Georg Chmiel, co-founder and group executive chairman of property portal Juwai IQI.Hongkongers fleeing in wake of 2019 protests, national security law boost overseas property markets from UK to CanadaCurrently, investors cannot buy homes or property for residency or passports in Vanuatu. The country is, however, working on a real estate option, which will enable applicants to invest in projects that contribute to the country’s development. The legislation was passed in April, and the government is currently working out exactly how the programme will work, including the time to launch and investment size.“The devil is in the details, so it is impossible to predict how popular the new option will be until we see the rules,” Chmiel said.Investment in Vanuatu property by mainland and Hong Kong buyers decreased by more than 60 per cent last year because of closed borders and loss of tourist income, which meant rents were no longer economical, according to Juwai IQI data. “Within three years, we expect it to be back to the levels of 2019, barring significant changes in the investment environment,” Chmiel said. Chinese investment was nearly nil in 2014 and climbed to a relatively high level by 2017, and stabilised somewhat in 2018 and 2019, he added.Chinese families were acquiring Vanuatu passports because they were easy and inexpensive to acquire and allowed their Children to obtain places in highly competitive schools at home more easily, Chmiel said.

So it is vital that whenever a person makes his or her decision, the three pillars are taken into consideration at all times.”With one Port Vila City Council (PVCC) by-election coming up this Friday at Freshwater Tassiriki and Anabrou Melcoffe Ward, a TIV Team led by Advocate Tamara, is doing its rounds to remind all voters to spend as long as possible to select the most qualified candidate to vote for, on that day.Tamara said Chapter 1 Article 1 of the Constitution says the people control the Power on which the Government shall rule. “We often emphasise that when you hold power, it means that we have the power to make the right decision to form a Government or Municipal Council. It means you are mandated to enter the small room to make the right decision to elect the right candidate to form the new Government or PVCC.“Even if you enter the room with a clear picture in mind as to who to vote for, you can still change your mind and choose another candidate if he or she seems likely to be a better and honest leader than whoever you have in mind.”Tamara reminded the people about the wordings of the National Anthem, saying the Anthem is worded to enflame patriotism for everybody to rise up as one group of “yumi” to work to develop the islands as a Nation.“I have travelled most of the islands from the North to the South and the sad truth is that some islands are empty of people,” he said.“They may say that life is hard on those islands but if you look carefully, there is fish in the sea and crops grow well in the gardens and everything is free where we come from.Despite the fact that they each differ in the environments in which they live, Tamara stressed the fact that the Anthem says “yumi brata evriwan” or we all are one.“While we all sing ‘yumi brata evriwan’ on the Nation’s Anniversary, it remains a question whether we live in peace in our homes and respect our families and do not mistreat our children and see eye to eye with our other halves”, says.With the current freedom of information flow, Tamara said all correct forms of information are available to unite everyone into one happy community. “Plante wok long ol aelan i stap” means that all kinds of jobs are pending, awaiting the availability of knowledge and wisdom to effect relevant changes in society.Chapter 2 of the Constitution refers to “right” to express oneself. Tamara measured a period between six o’clock in the morning and four o’clock the afternoon of the next day. “How many times have you greeted different people and apologised to someone for hurting them, or witness to someone about Christian truth?” he asked.He answered himself by saying most likely, people have gossiped about other people and said negative things more than anything else during the period. “In other words, we use our right to information to say negative things instead of positive things. If we continue without changing then we won’t contribute to the betterment of our communities, villages, islands and Provinces”, he said.Tamara encouraged all eligible voters in the communities that his team has visited so far, to prepare to make the right decisions with their choices of candidates to elect the candidate of their choice to contribute constructively towards promoting the most effective PVCC."

The ultimatum was confirmed by RBV Governor, Simeon Malachi Athy yesterday.Describing the operations of ‘Bless To Be Blessed’ as illegal, Mr Athy made the statement on behalf of the RBV which has the statutory powers under both the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu [CAP. 125] and the Financial Institution Act [CAP.254], to among other things: (i) ensure there is financial stability in the country; and (ii) issue licences for entities wanting to carry on banking business.“The Bank is aware that other relevant authorities are also playing their part to address this situation,” he said, noting members of the public in Vanuatu must have been aware of a Reserve Bank Notice this week about Scams, Ponzi schemes, Pyramid schemes and fraudulent activities that arise from time to time in Vanuatu.“In the last few months, the Bank has become aware that public were drawn in numbers towards an operation known as “Bless To Be Blessed” which promises high returns to depositors,” the RBV Governor said.“The Bank also understands that there are other similar schemes operating around Vanuatu, with similar characteristics of promising high returns.“The Bank is concerned that public in Vanuatu continue to fall prey to these scams, despite numerous public statements and awareness on these illegal activities and therefore advise against their continuation.“In the normal operation of such schemes, very high rates of returns are promised in order to entice new customers.“The scheme pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors; once the inflowing cash dries up, the scheme collapses, leaving a lot of people deprived of their hard-earned savings. Such schemes are set up to defraud people and always fall apart based on past examples. About four (4) different similar schemes have been established in the past.“Nothing much had happened to those involved and depositors’ funds have been lost or difficult to recover.“It is a concern that the public in Vanuatu has not learnt from those lessons.”The Bank therefore wishes to advise the public to stay away from these activities-as there is no guarantee that they will get their money back safe.“Bless to be Blessed” is an illegal activity that should have never been established in the first place, as the Licence obtained was issued under a non-existent law.The RBV has written to ‘Bless to be Blessed’ warning it that the business activities that they are illegally carrying on is a banking business without obtaining an appropriate banking licence from the regulator.On this basis, they are in breach of section 6 and 9 of the Financial Institutions Act.The Reserve Bank’s directive stipulates in that letter for Bless to be Blessed to immediately cease its operations:1. That all funds collected from the public be repaid forthwith as required by section 9 of the FIA; and2. Bless to be Blessed is given 7 days as of the date of this letter to refund all monies collected from the public.“In our discussion with B2BB, we advised them to formally write to the Bank on some of their requests; the Bank never agreed on the grace period as stated in certain media outlets,” Athy said.“The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu therefore warns the Public at large to immediately refrain from placing deposits into these illegal schemes as they are operating outside of the law and they do not have the necessary capital, investments and systems in place to guarantee the safety of depositor’s fund.”"

They must also bear the provincial government’s stamp and/or letterhead, licensee’s name, signature and/or name of the representative of the licensing authority and business licence number.Applications were then reassessed manually against the revised criteria. The reassessment identified 291 duplicated business licence numbers and these were corrected and paid. Furthermore, manual reassessment confirmed 223 business licences which were previously recorded as outstanding electronically were in fact paid.At least 706 did not meet the revised criteria while 392 met the required criteria.Delays in settling payment for the 392 was attributed to incorrect Bank account details and dormant Bank accounts. The Ministry of Finance stated it was very challenging to reach respective applicants to have such details corrected, thus, after three failed attempts to reach applicants, the applicants’ statuses were automatically changed to disqualified applicants.The Ministry assured payments to qualified applicants under the 2020 SMEs Grant will be processed directly to each respective account this week."

UNELCO is in charge of collecting this money, to be fully remitted to the government for the improvement of water systems for the outskirts of Port Vila.Director Sammy said they will be exploring other funding sources from the government or through multilateral partnerships to help speed up works. The first area outside Port Vila to be added to the UNELCO Concession was Teoumaville in 2019. Works are underway for the second area, Teouma Valley.An agreement was signed recently for the ownership of the water assets at the Teouma Valley Subdivision to be transferred to the Government. It was signed by REST Development Ltd as the developer of Teouma Valley Subdivision and the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources.DoWR and UNELCO will be working together to upgrade Teouma Valley water system to UNELCO standards.Residents at Teouma Valley will benefit from the agreement by receiving same quality water as enjoyed by other Port Vila customers and same affordable water rates, said Director Sammy.Director Sammy said everyone has the right to safe water thus, it is important that water systems come under the supervision of qualified operators or individuals specialise in water supply and treatment.A further agreement will be sign for UNELCO to operate and maintain the Teouma Valley water system on behalf of the government.

Due to the COVID-19 situation, other AUF campuses were not able to host celebrations.The event was joined by the Director of AUF Asia-Pacific, the French Ambassador, the Director of the National University of Vanuatu (NUV), Emalus Campus Director among other Ministry representatives and Directors of companies that partner with AUF.AUF Director of Asia-Pacific, Jean Marc Laveste joined the event over zoom call all the way from Vietnam and congratulated the AUF team in Port Vila, as well as the teachers, partners and students.The Asia Pacific Director said 80 students are continuing education for the Diplôme d’Accès aux Études Universitaires (DAEU) degree of access to university studies).Furthermore, 11 young people with academic difficulties who did not complete Year 13 have just passed the Diplôme Universitaires (DU) Multimedia mediation and internet monitoring, and 25 students are taking the European certification in computer science.AUF Port Vila is among one of the 60 employability centres of AUF with the main goal of strengthening the bridge between the university and the employment network globally. The centre is a network of Centres of employability connected on a global scale, network of 8 centres in Asia-Pacific, Bangkok, Hanoi, HCMV, Ulan Bator, Shanghai, Phnom Penh, Vientiane and Port Vila.“I am used to saying that our responsibility as academics is not to provide a degree, but to provide the skills that lead our graduates to a job, our youth to enter the world of work, participating in the economic development of their country, and in so doing to become responsible citizens,” said Director Laveste.The Director of NUV, Jean Pierre Nirua said, “We were fortunate to have a Francophone digital campus on the NUV campus, and now, in perfect adequacy with the university’s projects on student employability, the AUF is opening a Francophone Employability Centre, with whom, I hope, we will have a fruitful collaboration on this theme.”Director Nirua said this is a welcoming initiative, which will help and support ni-Vanuatu youth to train and find jobs in these difficult times."

VPPA reflects the true meaning of Independence.”The local entrepreneur said it is high time Vanuatu exports meet International and regional markets.“VPPA is the trigger to the country’s economic status,” he said. “There are no other avenues. Our lands are small, so we need to utilize our soil to produce more. This will produce a healthy Vanuatu, but also helping Pacific Island countries and other regions concerning food production.“VPPA has power to address issues we are facing. Such offers will step up the productive sector throughout Vanuatu. It is the right time as we are mature. We are 40 and I believe we are ready.“I acknowledge God for providing Tanna with one of the best soils in country which has been producing good quality farm products from past to present.”Niras was the first chairman elected to the Chamber of Commerce established in Tanna in 1993, where he labelled Lenakel as Blackman Town."

Such events assisted us to walk on water in terms of operation costs.”“The Resort targets international tourists but due to COVID-19, it has impacted us. It was difficult because the market advertised could not suit the locals, so we implemented local domestic tourism rates.”Evergreen Resort is also looking at other avenues to sustain its operation costs."

They’re best known for bringing monumental events, from the Moon landing, royal weddings, Live Aid Concert and Olympic Games in Sydney, into the living rooms of billions of people around the globe.As the foundational architects of satellite technology, Intelsat operates the world’s most trusted satellite telecom network. Today, Intelsat serves seven of the world’s top 10 MNOs, they’re the largest provider of connectivity for the offshore oil & gas market, they reach more than two billion people via TV and radio, 90% of cruise passengers and crew rely on them for connectivity, they provide in-flight connectivity to 20 commercial airline partners and more than 3,000 aircraft and they’re a large provider of satellite services in the government sector.With its notable track record, the company has a strong reputation for providing secure, reliable, and high-quality hardware that is safer against cyberattacks and more resilient to outages than any other global transmission service. Intelsat owns a fleet of 50+ orbiting satellites, combined with teleport gateways, making it the world’s most extensive and secure communications network on the planet, covering 99% of populated areas.The AelanSat network in Vanuatu will work in conjunction with the existing Interchange Cable Network, pushing bandwidth to every corner of Vanuatu, making it the most effective and affordable solution to provide fast and reliable connectivity to the whole country, which will improve security, and health, and education outcomes.Increasing connectivity capacity also opens Vanuatu up to new industries, including data storage, which will diversify the country’s tourism-dependent economy.Like the vast areas of the South Pacific, other remote locations globally have benefited from satellite technology, which has aided economic development and improved delivery of services in areas where infrastructure is limited.Only satellite can service many remote parts of the planet. In the remote southern channels of the Chilean Sea off the coast of Chile, salmon farmers in the world’s second-largest salmon-producing region capture and send huge amounts of production and environment data using satellite technology, facilitating analysis optimize feeding, caretaking, and improving fish welfare.Better communications between farmers and the mainland also improve their quality of life. In remote areas like this, only satellite communication can provide these vital services.After Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm in 2019, the devastation wiped out critical communications services, hindering relief efforts being coordinated on the United States mainland. Within 24 hours, Intelsat helped bring essential communications back online through the deployment of satellite connectivity terminals and Wi-Fi, keeping relief teams safe and coordinated, and enabling the massive support effort.In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), more than 65% of the population lives in rural areas, and the vast majority of them are not covered by mobile networks, representing a major socio-economic gap and isolation from the modern world. Hundreds of small villages that are widely spread would mean costly construction of infrastructure over long distances and difficult terrain, often with no electricity source available. Without a national grid, energy would be a considerable ongoing cost, especially in areas where cell sites depend on diesel generators — a common target for theft.Telecommunications company Vodacom made the logical decision to leverage the Intelsat satellite network combined with terrestrial services to expand mobile coverage into rural areas, which has vastly improved security by making it easier to contact authorities, and to open the door for job opportunities, new business ventures, and money transfers enhancing the health and well-being of people across the region.Due to COVID-19 related delays in global supply chains, the launch of AelanSat has been delayed until late 2021."

These two areas require immediate attention.“There will be no compulsory deductions from members. Members will choose if they want to be covered in the scheme or not.  “90% of members surveyed want MBS to be optional. We do not think we have the right to make it compulsory.“If they want to be covered in this scheme, they have to contribute a premium of Vt5,000 for five years to access the Vt1 million coverage.“We will proceed with special death benefit and funeral assistance and will later cover cyclone and medical assistance once we are ready. “Also, no insurance broker will be engaged in the scheme implementation, which means there will be no administrative expenses.“VNPF board has already approved the proposed Special Death Benefit Scheme. We expect it to be a much better scheme than the existing one.“We want to roll out the modified scheme starting early next year. Awareness will be conducted until the launching,” he added."

Even our seasonal workers abroad can start putting aside some of their income earned using their mobiles,” said the Minister of Finance.He said this concept of the mobile wallet has been a game changer in fostering financial inclusion, which is one of the government’s key priorities.“The government has a renewed focus on fostering financial inclusion of our informal sector workers, which make up around 80% of Vanuatu’s workforce-farmers, fishermen, drivers, market vendors, handicraft makers and kava owners. Many do not have any savings or a bank account,” Minister Koanapo said.“A more inclusive economy has many benefits for our people. Aside from supporting livelihoods of informal sector workers, there are positive flow-on effects on education, health and other primary service delivery.“With this initiative, VNPF is helping the government in improving the digitalisation of financial security and integration to our informal sector as well.“The government is working hard to support the informal sector by facilitating inter-island trade and industry.“This M-Vatu platform is an important stepping stone towards extending access to key productive markets and services to our rural population.“We first welcomed Vodafone’s M-Vatu initiative in Vanuatu in 2019, with the support of the Reserve and UNDP. Sending and withdrawing cash, buying mobile credit and making bill payments is now possible from a mobile phone.“M-Vatu is a safe and convenient way for people to move money in our primary cash-based economy. And with free registration, anyone can join.“I encourage every self-employed worker to join VNPF, register with M-Vatu and secure your future.”This M-Vatu transaction for VNPF has been realised through the partnership between VNPF, Vodafone, International Labor Organisation (ILO) and the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF).Minister Koanapo said he has directed the VNPF Board and General Manager to work closely with Digicel, Vanuatu Post, Bred Bank and other similar electronic wallet platform providers to develop stronger working relations.“We understand Bred Bank has already initiated discussions for their payment gateway online payment processing platform with VNPF.“This relationship will see all Bred Bank customers which are VNPF employers, once signed up for this payment gateway, will be able to pay their monthly contributions for their employees directly through the platform.“We are living in a digital transformation age and we need to take on board such initiative to help boost the social welfare of our members,” said Minister Koanapo.Chairman of the VNPF Board, CVNPF’s GM Parmod Achary and Vodafone’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Barlen Lutchmoodoo joined the Minister of Finance to launch the M-Vatu initiative in the presence of Vodafone and VNPF staff yesterday."

Transparency between regulator and airline is vital.“At Air Vanuatu, you, our customers are the focus of everything we do.“For each trip you take with us, our airline team knows your safety, the service we provide to you and your satisfaction are number one!“With regard to Bryan Johnston’s comments, our concern with his involvement in the carrying out the aircraft owner’s asset inspection was one of privacy and security as well as commercial sensitivity.“Our concern was obviously justified because here he is sensationalising missing out on a job.“For your information, aircraft owners have previously arranged for independent, unbiased engineers from NZ to carry out their asset inspections, there are no aspects of safety involved whatsoever.“An alternative arrangement was made and a desk study of the aircraft’s records for the period was undertaken.“I also find it ironic that Mr Johnston talks about the safety of people’s lives and yet unsafe engine run practices almost killed one of his Ni Vanuatu staff recently.”"

The government is fully supportive of Hello Vanuatu and their business ethos of providing this technology free to our people, with data privacy at the heart of the network”.The system boasts the latest cutting edge technology so Vanuatu can leap frog the technology gap. It is a world first blockchain technology with the capacity to go offline. Minister of Finance stated “this system is designed by Ni-Vanuatu for Ni-Vanuatu and address the limitation of internet, Vanuatu’s vulnerability to natural disasters, in-affordability of software. It takes into account the needs of our people in the islands”.Unlike other platforms the Hello Vanuatu runs without the support of systems from tech giants. The importance of this is to ensure there is a no data leak. Your data is your data and will not be sold to a third party. Minister Koanapo said, “the Government is excited about the protection of personal data of Vanuatu citizen and having a system that is own by yumi everiwan. Let us protect Vanuatu’s core values of culture and respect.”Hello Social focuses on protecting culture and reducing addictions. The system is user friendly in and is trained to understand Bislama.

Any eggs that come in will be hit with 40% egg tariffs. Imported eggs means money going to other countries and less employment for the Vanuatu people,” he said.“The government should just totally ban eggs coming into the country to give Ni Van people small egg farms to make a bit of money.”Since the borders closed, delay in eggs cartons or egg trays have also added to the financial stress of Chiko Farms. Mr Thode explained that their product is time sensitive and it needs the proper packaging, so a delay would mean that eggs cannot be safely packaged and shipped to the outer islands of Santo, Malekula, Tanna, Ambae and Ambrym.Chiko Farm Sales officer that over 100 trays of eggs are shipped to Malekula weekly that’s over 3,000 eggs to Malekula only and when there are no trays, the eggs either have to be given for free or sold at half price before it expires.“Chiko has lost VT60 million due to imported eggs and lack of packaging,” the owner of Chiko Farm said. The General Manager of Dynamics, Sophia Fogarty refused to comment on the increase of imported egg tariffs. Dynamics imports eggs from New Zealand."
331,https://vbr.vu/news/vfsc-no-guidelines-for-digital-assets-yet/,2021-08-07 23:19:00,VFSC: NO GUIDELINES FOR DIGITAL ASSETS YET,"By Hilaire BuleVanuatu Financial Service Commission’s (VFSC) Commissioner, Branan Garae, has said Vanuatu wants to promote digital assets but there is a risk as there are no guidelines in place yet.He said there is a need to put in place a guideline for interested people to apply.Manager Supervisor for the VFSC, Joshua Tari, said currently there is potential for the people to loose their money.For that reason VFSC has decided during its board meeting this week to issue a first statement to educate people of Vanuatu on this issue.VFSC said as the integrated regulator for non-banking financial services it is supportive of Fintech (financial technology)-related activities in the jurisdiction.In light of the developments in Fintech activities, and the numerous queries from its licensees and stakeholders regarding the possibility for them to invest in cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, the Financial Dealers Licensing Act has been amended and now gazetted.The amended Financial Dealers Licensing (FDL) Act No. 9 of 2021 created four classes of FDL licenses, Class A, B, C and D.The Class D license authorizes the regulated and licensed entity to “provide service of distribution, secondary trading, custodial storage, provision of investment advice or other services in relation to digital assets”.In seeking to provide clarifications to its licensees and stakeholders on investment in digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, VFSC says it considers as a digital asset, any token in electronic/binary form which is representative of either the holder’s access rights to a service or of the ownership of an asset.A digital asset, in this respect, includes a digital representation of value which is used as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value but which is not legal tender, even if it is denominated in legal tender, represent assets such as debt or equity in the promoting company and provides access to a blockchain-based application, service or product.The VFSC statement said that a digital asset will, however, exclude any transaction in which a business, as part of an affinity or rewards programme, grants value, which cannot be exchanged for legal tender, bank credit or any digital asset and a digital representation of value issued by or on behalf of the publisher for use within an online game platform.“Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in Vanuatu and the VFSC considers it as sub-category of digital asset,” the VFSC statement states.Cryptocurrencies, unlike fiat currencies, are not legal tender in Vanuatu as per the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu communiqués No.15 of 2017 and No. 10 of 2018.However, the VFSC acknowledged that, albeit reliant upon market demand and supply, cryptocurrencies have “value” since they are exchangeable for other things that have value.“Thereby showing characteristic akin to physical commodities such as grain or precious metal.“The VFSC thus considers cryptocurrencies, from a regulatory standpoint, as being a “store of value”, similar to physical commodities.”The statement said there is recognition of digital assets cryptocurrencies as an asset-class for expert investors.“Since transactions in cryptocurrencies are unregulated and their prices are extremely volatile in their exchange rates to fiat money, investments in cryptocurrencies tend to be of a high-risk nature.“The VFSC nonetheless, recognizes that digital assets and cryptocurrencies may constitute an asset-class appropriate for investment by sophisticated investors, expert investors, expert funds, specialized collective investment schemes, professional collective investment schemes (PCIS) and closed-end funds (CEF) for licensed dealers.“VFSC wishes to inform the public that financial dealers license holders are already regulated entities.“Only these entities holding classes A, B and C licenses may be considered for a class D license which will be allowed to deal in digital assets.“No issuance, no initial coin offering is allowed, so restriction in the nature of dealings.“All of them are reporting entities to VFIU and are licensed and supervised by VFSC.”The VFSC statement went on to say that the addition of digital asset to the Financial Dealers Licensing Amendment Act is a small step forward for Vanuatu and a fully fledged regulatory and legislative framework still needs to be put in place and there is till a long way to go.“The Distributed Ledger Task Force led by VFSC is currently working on further amendment and on a specific detailed legislation about virtual asset business that will address the needs of Vanuatu and will provide the necessary enabling legislation to ignite the full potential of blockchain technology.“VFSC is informing the public that investment into digital assets and cryptocurrencies is not protected by any statutory compensation arrangement in Vanuatu.“Given the high-risk nature of Investment, the VFSC considers that cryptocurrencies may not be suitable for investment by retail investors at this stage.“VFSC thus urges all prospective investors to fully ascertain the related risk prior to committing any funds for investment in digital assets and cryptocurrencies.“In addition, VFSC hereby informs the public and retail investors that any investment in cryptocurrencies is at their own risk and that they are not protected by any statutory compensation arrangement in Vanuatu.“All Financial Dealers Licenses granted will be reviewed before renewal and at this stage VFSC confirms to the public that no license of class D for digital assets dealer has yet been issued.“Innovation and digitalization are phenomena no jurisdiction can ignore; Vanuatu must mitigate the risks whilst harnessing the opportunities that digital assets provide.”"

Especially in underserved areas in Vanuatu. Wantok sees this as a paramount need to the country and so, we welcome the initiative to do so. I think we can all agree that t6he areas to be served are all very challenging but the best way to serve them is if the networks collaborate under the umbrella of the Universal access policy (UAP).”Wantok is a newcomer to this agreement. According to Mr Kaitapu, Wantok launched in 2014 in Vanuatu under different leadership and ownership.”The current ownership is very formidable in terms of investments and in terms of growing the business”This must be so as the CEO discloses that Wantok has earlier in the year decided to go Pacific wide. An expansion from Vanuatu to other Pacific islands.”Wantok will also be introducing new services here in Vanuatu under the Wantok brand. In the coming months the Wantok Branch will be launching in Tonga as Wantok pans out” says the Wantok CEO.Under the UAP Wantok will be providing voice and text services to the people of Vanuatu. Wantok has 14 towers throughout Vanuatu.”Regardless of our current position, the agreement binds us to provide 80%coverage to the population of Vanuatu, that is our target for the next 12 months,” says Mr Kaitapu.The launching of Wantok’s new services is still something the company is keeping on the down low but the CEO was clear in stating that the launch will be very soon. “We hope that Wantok’s entry into the Market will contribute substantially to the availability of network services in Vanuatu,” says the CEO."

The Bisnis Nakamal provides these benefits to individuals, businesses and the Government departments.Unlike other programs that are sponsored by several sponsors, the Bisnis Nakamal is established in partnership with Breadfruit Consulting and Wanfuteng bank, which will be subsidising the costs allowing the trainings to be at affordable prices to all who are interested. Not only so, but unlike other v-lab programs that last almost a year, Bisnis Nakamal cycles last from 8 to the maximum of 12 weeks.Presently three cycles have been developed to help young entrepreneurs. The Seed Haos, The Green Haos and The Market house. These all deal with different stages of an idea and a business.The Chief Risk Officer of Wanfuteng Bank, Marianna Lal shares that “Wanfuteng Bank is proud to sponsor Bisnis Nakamal, the new V-Lab project supporting the development of business entrepreneurs. Since its inception, Wanfuteng Bank has been passionate about financial inclusion, financial literacy and advancement of local businesses, therefore this initiative ties well with the Bank’s social responsibility objectives.”She continues; “The Bank considers the Bisnis Nakamal targets to be closely aligned with the Vanuatu 2030 Peoples Plan (National Sustainable Development Plan 2016-2030) Economy Pillar 4 by aiming to create jobs and business opportunities. The Bank is excited to see local talent being given an opportunity to access resources which will help them to develop their business ideas and turn them into viable business models.”Senior Consultant at Breadfruit Consulting, Chris Elphick says, “We are not running a training institution. This is about helping people learn and through learning, learning together. We will not be running huge workshops, we will be working in small groups.”According to Mr Elphick the whole notion of the Bisnis Nakamal is that there is no starting curriculum, there is just a need to help develop businesses. The whole idea is to create an environment to grow these business ideas and in turn, businesses."

TRBR regulator Brian Winji says; “TRBR is the implementing agency of the Government that implements the Government policy in regards to universal access.Vodafone, Digicel and Wantok sealed their agreement with TRBR through the signing of this contract providing that the three operators provide extended coverage.This means providing service to 20 rural areas in Vanuatu with large populations.” According to Mr Winji , Wantok is a newcomer to this agreement. There is a policy that requires 98% broadband (internet) and narrowband (texting and voice services)coverage in order to be eligible to participate in the agreement.Wantok as a mobile operator meets this criteria in providing both, rherefore it has been invited by TRBR to join this program.The program is intended to close the gap in communications. “So far we have 90% covered but the remaining 20% gap is what we are trying to close,” says Mr Winji.All three operators agree that Vanuatu is one of the most challenging places to connect due to geographical and natural Disaster elements.The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Vodafone Vanuatu Barlen Lutchmoodoo says, “On Epi Island, the rural infrastructure, its hills make it difficult for us to operate.But people need communications to breach the digital divide. Despite the challenges Vodafone has done its best as an operator and will continue to try its best in closing the 20% gap in coverage”The Head of Business Solution at Digicel Vanuatu, Rupert Benson states, “Digicel came to Vanuatu 13 years ago. This is the most challenging country. Digicel has been through cyclone PAM, Cyclone Harold, it has been through Ambae and Tanna, It never stops moving.There are many challenges but the people of Vanuatu always find a way forward. Digicel plans to do the same” The CEO of Wantok Vanuatu, Justine Kaitapa says “Wantok is quiet happy to participate in this program.We hope to complement existing infrastructure in the country as well as existing operators and what they have achieved so far on the collaboration effort going forward” Mr Winji says the operators will relieve direct assistance from the Vanuatu Government in terms of implementing paid approach in Vanuatu.The operators who have signed recommitted to play (keep developing their networks in rural areas) instead of paying the Universal access (UAP) levy to the Trust account of the Government.Other operators who are not included in the agreement or committed to play pay UAP 4% of their net Revenue to the governments trust account.“Other benefits of the agreement to the operators include exemption of import duty, exemption of VAT on some particular items, exempting on spectrum licenses. Also, this year TRBR will provide a small subsidy to help meet challenges in cash flow and loss in low revenue,” says Mr Winji.The roll out of Universal Access Policy (UAP) in Vanuatu is to leave no one behind and offer the affordability services to the people from North to South of Vanuatu."

The FFB is intended to help resolve this problem.The FFB encourages locals to be domestic consumers, local tourists.The FFB transports free of charge, booking is available at the Vanuatu information Center (VIC) office.This is opposite Alliance Francaise in town, next to Western Union.Bookings are open from Mondays to Fridays from 8am-3pm. Upon booking a VT1,000 Deposit has to be made. This is in case the booking is not met, then the VT1000 is not returned. However, if customers do use the FFB, the deposit is returned.The buses are only available on weekends and public holidays with two FFB in service a day.The FFB also operates in Santo presently.There is an itinerary of local tourism sites prepared that people can choose to go when booking the FFB. After booking the VIC makes all other arrangements to ensure complete ease for the consumer.The FFB has generated a lot of positive feedback.“More than 50% of consumers are making use of the FFB,” Songi said.“We are able to see a lot of locals that are now through the FFB able to go out and spend at local tourism sites.”The Domestic Marketing and Tourism officer also talks about VTO’s Tourism Marketing storian. VTO visits outer islands and tourism operators that are registered in the VTO database.The purpose of this is to help find local operators find ways to market their business as well as prepare them for the borders opening which may be soon.This means updating web pages, putting up updated pictures and contacts as well as adding a google mapping feature to help international travellers.So far, the VTO has visited several islands such as Islands in Torres, Banks, Mota Lava, Rah Island, Vanua Lava, the East and South of Santo, South, Central and Eastern part of Malekula, North Efate, Pele, Nguna, Tanna and Aneityum.

349,https://vbr.vu/news/ato-proposed-change-to-tax-guidelines-affecting-australian-expatriates-in-vanuatu/,2021-05-29 23:12:00,ATO proposed change to TAX guidelines affecting Australian expatriates in Vanuatu,"In the 2021 AUSTRALIAN Budget, The Australian Tax Office proposed new guidelines on how the ATO will consider who is a resident or non-resident in Australia under Australian Tax law. This will change how tax will be paid by expatriates living overseasIf and when implemented, it will have a profound effect on the way that Australian expatriates are recruited and paid internationally. There are many expatriate Australians currently employed in the Public and Private Sector of Vanuatu. If an Australian earns income in Vanuatu but is considered a resident for Tax purposes in Australia, all overseas income will need to be declared and assessed by the ATO. This means that any income earned in Vanuatu will need to be taxed if the individual fails to convince the ATO that they are not resident in Australia.Currently, the main guideline for tax planning of Expatriate Australians is based upon four tests for the definition of residency status.The Resides RuleThis test is a subjective interpretation of where an individual is actually residing based on economic ties, dependencies, social and living arrangements.The Domicile RuleUnder this test, if the individual is not residing in Australia under the Reside Rule, but shows clear ties to Australia through ownership of a home that is not being rented, or have dependents, and there is intent to live in Australia, they are considered resident for tax purposes unless their permanent place of Abode is outside of Australia.The 183 Day RuleUnder the 183 day rule if an Australian stayed in the country for 183 days over a period of 12 months, they were deemed to be resident for tax purposes and income earned outside of Australia was taxable under Australian law.The Superannuation TestIf an individual has superannuation paid by an Australian company, they are deemed to be resident for tax purposes.The Proposed ChangesThe Australian Residency rules were enacted over 80- years ago and there had been criticism that in the current environment of global work practices and an increasingly mobile labour force, a review of the rules was needed to provide a more consistent approach on determining the residenvy status of individuals who currently work overseas.The Bright Line TestThe changes are based on recommendations by the Board of Taxation which conducted a review of the rules to determine residency in 2018. The board’s proposed residency rules called for a two-step approach, with the first being a 45 day Bright Line test – where an individual who spends 45 days or more in Australia is a considered a tax resident. The Bright Line test and is similar to rules of residency in other Countries like the UK and the US.Adhesive Residency RuleThe second test under the proposed changed is the introduction of Adhesive Residency Test. The concept of an Adhesive Residency is that the Australian Residency “clings” to you for a period of three years after you have left Australia.The ramifications on Vanuatu will be felt in how employers recruit non-citizens and the employment contract negotiations. These changes will mean that any Australian employed under two year contracts in Vanuatu may have to consider that their Salaries could be taxed when they return to Australia. The cost of living in Vanuatu is amongst highest in the Pacific but the absence of income tax on wages and salaries, and the attractive lifestyle here, has made it financially feasible to attract Australian contractors. Among those affected would be teachers who have been recruited from Australia, Managers of large Aid Donor Projects like the current Cook Barracks, and Senior Management at some banks.For those other expatriate Australian who qualify to be Non- Resident, but still have ties to Australia through owning property, family and other factors, they now need to consider whether the option of taking out Vanuatu Citizenship is an attractive proposition if they are earning high incomes.The timing of when the new changes will be implemented is uncertain with the current COVID-19 situation. It has been suggested that these changes will come in to effect in 2022."

Its two objectives are:1. Technically support and financially assist tourism businesses in the short term to survive the impact of the COVID 19 crises and to have them ready to receive local tourists while they wait for the border restrictions to be uplifted and to also be ready to receive international tourists for when the borders do open.2. To encourage tourism businesses to follow the principles of sustainable and responsible tourism, including product diversification, increased local benefits, safe business operations, energy efficiency, waste management and water conservation.”Under the TBSP financial assistance will be available to eligible and approved tourism businesses under three categories:• Tourism Business Survival Grants: for costs associated with cleaning, maintenance, gardening, security, safety and utility bills.• Renewable Energy Subsidy Scheme: assistance for audit checks and appliance purchasing through the National Green Energy Fund.• Agritourism Support Program: assistance for selected projects who have integrated the tourism and agriculture sectors into their products.Application forms are available on the DoT website and can be filled out and submitted on-line.The TBSP Management team will be available both at the DoT head office in Port Vila and through the DoT Provincial Offices to assist all business operators with questions about the application forms.Further Awareness Workshops are planned for each of the provinces on the below dates: Port Vila – Mon 31st May – Thur 3rd Jun – Grand Hotel; Tanna — Mon 14th Jun – Fri 18 Jun; Malekula – Mon 21st Jun – Thur 24th Jun; Santo – Mon 28th Jun – Thur 1st Jul; Ambae – Mon 5th Jul – Thur 8th Jul; Gaua – Mon 12th Jul – Fri 16th Jul; Vanua Lava – Wed 14th Jul – TBSP Session, and Mota Lava – Thur 15th Jul – TBSP session."

363,https://vbr.vu/news/recovery-plan-priority-of-new-air-van-ceo/,2021-01-11 23:59:00,Recovery Plan Priority of New Air Van CEO,"By Royson WillieThe newly appointed Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Air Vanuatu, ‘Atu Finau, told Daily Post yesterday in an exclusive interview that the priority of the airline currently is to formulate a recovery plan.That is the first major task given to the new CEO on his first week in office by the Board of Directors of the airline and Shareholders.His first impression on the first week is that there are even more challenges than anticipated.Mr Finau said the recovery plan involves implementing strategies and cost-reduction measures so that the airline can begin to have a more positive outlook.“We are putting together the plan now as required by the Board of Directors as well as the Shareholders.“We have to submit it by the 15th of this month, which is next week.“It’s basically a plan of what’s happening now.“Right now we only have the domestic.“So what we’re doing, we are reviewing every aspect of the domestic to see if it is the right schedule, the right airfare, the right people, the right numbers to provide service because, for businesses the service should be able to cover the cost of all the people who are in services required to provide that service.“That’s what we’re trying to do,” he said.Mr Finau said the airline’s history shows that it has been on the higher side in terms of numbers.He said the recovery plan is a rescue plan for the airline.“We are mindful on when the borders will open and what are the areas that need immediate attention.“We’re working hard with every agencies such as in tourism to come up with the right prediction (on when the border opens).On the Commission of Inquiry, Mr Finau said his team is working together with the Commission in its inquiry.He said the aircraft at the centre of inquiry, after the purchase of two Airbus A220, is a new type of aircraft that no one (in Air Vanuatu) knows anything about it yet.This means it will require a lot of training for staff and other requirement in order for the type of aircraft to do the Air Vanuatu routes.“What i want to do is to understand the reason why that person or that group of people made the decision.“And at this point i haven’t reached that understanding yet,” he said.On sticking to schedules and much complaints raised, Mr Finau says he wants to see the airline stick to its schedule unless it is a matter of life and death for the schedule to change.“I have already had discussions with management in regards to schedules.“If we say we fly at 8, we have to fly at 8.“We’re doing this review with the mindset that hopefully we can decrease the airfare.“Schedule, timing, frequency we have to get them right and the basic issue is, do we have the right type of aircraft to do this type of operation?“It’s like we’re overhauling the whole domestic.“I am very hopeful that there is a possibility we will decrease the current airfares,” he said.Mr Finau is a strong believer of the localisation policy in terms of staff and operations of the airline as well as having the right balance of expatriates and ni-Vanuatu in the company.He said safety is a high priority for him as well for the airline.The Air Vanuatu CEO said Post-COVID-19, the situation the airline is facing is the same as many other airlines are facing.However, there are financial issues arising from optimistic and ambitious decision-making that pre-date the global pandemic, that have left the airline more vulnerable than it might otherwise be.“In planning for recovery, we will closely examine our present financial position and determine ways to lower cost.“This will include reviewing and resizing personnel numbers, property, plant and equipment and then discarding non-value generating assets that may have some disposal value.“The number of staff members employed needs to correspond with out current level of business activity.“That is, domestic flights for in-country travellers and repatriation flights as arising.“Further along, as border restrictions ease and we begin to generate more income, we’ll be able to look at gradually increasing employee numbers once more.“Previously, international operations have cross-subsidised unprofitable domestic routes.“The lack of international business has fully exposed the economic realities of domestic air transport policies, scheduling and pricing.“Government policy obligations confirm their continued intention to subsidise domestic air transport, however holding prices at the same level while the Consumer Price Index (by 5% per year in the past five years) has further impacted domestic operation viability.“A way to manage this would be to quantify subsidise and allocate funding on a regular basis to mitigate the impact,” the Air Vanuatu CEO said.He acknowledged the Board of Directors and Shareholders for the confidence and support.“Our journey forward will present many challenges.“How we meet each one, identify a solution and make it a reality will be proof of our commitment to succeed,” Finau said."

365,https://vbr.vu/news/first-ever-domestic-tourism-marketing-strategy-launched-at-mi-tumoro-vanuatu-travel-expo/,2021-06-26 22:29:00,First ever Domestic Tourism Marketing Strategy launched at ‘Mi Tumoro Vanuatu Travel Expo’,"The Vanuatu Tourism Office (VTO) is excited to release its Domestic Tourism Marketing Strategy 2021-2023. This new strategy is just another way that VTO is Answering the Call of Vanuatu.One of the few positives to emerge from the global Covid-19 pandemic is the opportunity that it has given VTO to be able to trial a domestic tourism marketing campaign, Sapotem Lokol Turisim.VTO have been trialling this campaign to encourage more Ni-Vanuatu and expatriate residents to experience more of what Vanuatu has to offer.“We live in one of the most stunningly beautiful countries on Earth, but sometimes, we take this fact for granted, and forget to take the time to go and go spel in our own country,” VTO stated.With VTO’s trial Sapotem Lokol Turisim campaign, many more people are realising this. The campaign has built on the strong consumer sentiment that exists in the community for supporting local business through this difficult time. It links to the wellbeing theme of high-value low-impact tourism, implementing activity 1.1.5 of the Vanuatu Sustainable Tourism Strategy as the policy priority facilitated by the Department of Tourism (DOT), providing these strong results:• The Vanuatu community has shown overwhelming support for local tourism businesses;• Tourism businesses have received revenue;• Tourism businesses have been able to provide ongoing work for staff;• Tourism businesses have been able to keep their staff’s hospitality skills up-to-date;• Consumers previously reluctant to think of themselves as domestic tourists have gained the confidence to seek their own tourist experiences at tourism businesses and attractions;• VTO has discovered a host of new products, helped develop them, and promoted them to domestic tourism consumers.• Many local tourism consumers have created special memories of places and experiences.Ultimately, the main success of this campaign is how it has led domestic tourism consumers to realise just how many incredible tourism attractions, locations and experiences are available in our country.VTO’s new Domestic Tourism Marketing Strategy builds on the lessons learned by the trial phase of our Sapotem Lokol Turisim campaign, and creates for the first time a strategic direction for VTO’s marketing activities in support of domestic tourism.The VTO will use the DTMS to guide the creation of new marketing initiatives that will form the marketing component of the Tourism Crisis Response and Recovery Plan and the Vanuatu Sustainable Tourism Strategy that VTO is responsible for implementing.The Domestic Tourism Marketing Strategy has three goals:1. Provide short term revenue streams for the tourism industry while borders are closed;2. Encourage the domestic market to make a habit of using tourism businesses as part of their everyday lives;3. Encourage the domestic market to see more of Vanuatu, and drive dispersal of domestic tourists to businesses beyond Efate.To reach these goals, the DTMS is based on six objectives:Objective 1: Domestic leisure tourism grows throughout the whole country;Objective 2: The government and corporate travel market segment become ‘ambassadors’ for domestic tourism;Objective 3: Demand for adventure activities increases throughout Vanuatu;Objective 4: Cultural festivals and events become a major reason for domestic travel;Objective 5: Movement of domestic tourists to their destinations and back home is facilitated;Objective 6: Demand for restaurants, bars and hospitality service providers for the domestic tourism market is developed and utilized.The Domestic Tourism Marketing Strategy also complements the 2030 Vanuatu Tourism Market Development Plan, which provides the strategic direction for VTO’s international marketing activities, and links to the high-value low-impact approach of the Vanuatu Sustainable Tourism Strategy for the development of a domestic plan to support Vanuatu’s tourism industry.But that’s not all the Vanuatu Tourism Office team has been up to since the global Covid-19 pandemic closed our borders. In addition to working hard to support Vanuatu’s tourism businesses by creating and stimulating demand for domestic tourism through the Sapotem Lokol Turisim campaign, VTO has undertaken a number of other related activities, including Free Fun Bus services in Espiritu Santo and Efate, and Turisim Marketing Storians conducted on almost every island in the archipelago, from the Torres all the way down to Aneityum.VTO has also run a number of consumer events, including this week’s Mi Tumoro Vanuatu Travel Expo in Port Vila, where the Domestic Tourism Marketing Strategy is being launched today at Haos blong Handikraft.“I’d like to thank all the tourism operators who have participated and supported our efforts to develop our domestic market,” says VTO’s CEO, Ms Adela Issachar Aru.“In particular, we thank our national airline Air Vanuatu as well as other aviation partners who have supported domestic tourism with affordable airfares for domestic tourists.“I urge everyone to help VTO grow domestic tourism in Vanuatu. There’s never been a better time to get out and enjoy what our country has to offer.”VTO encourages everyone to get out and Sapotem Lokol Turisim — and don’t forget to post your domestic tourism experiences on social media using the hashtag #SapotemLokolTurisim!"

Both wharfs provide vital connections in terms of domestic trade, commerce and the movement of people from the outer islands to Port Vila and Luganville.Fletcher will have 180 days to complete the repair works, or six months commencing from the date of contract effectiveness.Lenakel and Litzlitz wharf repairs come under Vanuatu Inter-Island Shipping Support Project (VISSP), delivered by VPMU and funded by the New Zealand Government and Asian Development Bank (ADB).The key aim of VISSP is to strengthen inter-island connectivity through construction of new island wharf or jetties for at least seven islands including Tanna, Malekula, Santo and Efate.Chairman of the VPMU Steering Committee, who is also Director-General of the Prime Minister’s Office, Gregoire Nimbtik expressed delight at the conclusion of the procurement process.“VISSP has had its challenges, made worse by the current global pandemic.

She says, Air Taxi Vanuatu have a five-seater Cessna 206 aircraft based in Santo and a six-seater Cessna 207 aircraft based in Port Vila.The CEO says, the Cessna 207, registered YJ-TAN, has an upgraded IO-550 engine, a more powerful, reliable engine from a state of the art overhaul facility in Australia. In addition Air Taxi has installed a brand new, larger yet quieter and more powerful ‘Hartzell’ propeller.Johnstone says ,new digital engine instruments have been fitted to improve reliability especially when it comes to reading the cylinder head temperature,exhaust gas temperature, and general oil pressure and temperature, along with new tachometer, fuel flow and manifold pressure gauges.She says the 206 aircraft registered YJ-VAC which is currently based in Santo has a new IO-520 engine fitted, also recently overhauled at the state of the art facility in Australia and has also been fitted with a new and upgraded GPS.Air Taxi Vanuatu’s aircrafts operate under the Visual Flight Rules (VFR), meaning they can only operate in good weather when the visibility is good so the pilots can use the visual features outside as reference. Under VFR they can not fly at night.Johnstone however says one of their twin engine aircraft, the Britten Norman Islander is capable of flying under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) which allows the pilots to fly at night and in bad weather totally relying on the flight instruments when the visibility is poor.The CEO says when charter flights from Port Vila to the other islands take place, potential passengers can buy tickets to fly back to Port Vila when the plane returns, however she says this depends on what the charter is or who is doing the charter.Johnstone mentions there are some goods which are classed as dangerous for flying, and she says they will always comply with the Civil Aviation Authority of Vanuatu and New Zealand when it comes to determining what is safe to fly.She adds Air Taxi prides itself on customer satisfaction, price beat guarantee and aircraft reliability."

As everyone stocked up on hygienic products and shops started to run low on stock. Vanua soap provided a timely solution.Joelle Kamata is the mastermind behind this fairly recently established business.Based in Santo, Vanua soap handcrafts soap with original formulas totally unique to the business. All products are made with local resources Coconut oil, Tamanu oil, Nangai oil, Cocoa butter, Turmeric, Moringa, Cocoa powder And soon ginger powder.The business currently produces between8.000 to 10.000 soaps a day with Retail prices that range from 40 to 100 vatu and currently employs 8 permanent workers and 3 temporary workers.There are 6 different soaps made with different raw elements. In the coming month more varieties will be unveiled on the company’s Facebook page Vanua soap.Vanua soap has grown through challenges to exist as it does presently. The entirety of 2019 was dedicated to preparing the soap factory in Santo for production and its Grand opening in 2020.In April of the same year opening Tropical Cyclone Harold had swept across Santo severely damaging the goods produced as well as the raw materials. This proved a huge challenge as the business had to begin again from scratch.Despite it all, in July of 2020 the Department of Industry invited the resilient business to take part in a trade show in Port-Vila where Vanua soap made a name for itself promoting its products and the company while establishing professional network.Vanua soap has worked with several other institutions at this time.It has produced soap for World Vision, sold their products at shops in Santo such as New look, Shops in Port-Vila such as Pandanus and Organic and Paradise. Currently the company is working with Cellovilla to produce liquid soap and amenities for hotels.Joelle reveals some future plans for the business as she states;“Nowadays, we hope to increase the number of customers and afterward, open a branch in Port-Vila to ease the distribution of our products.”There are big things in store for this business but according to the owner she wants to focus on assuring that the staff of her business in Santo are well trained before advancing onto bigger things."

Businesses in attendance of the showcase were Ricoh, Navit communications, Single window, PDT consulting, Raise Vanuatu, Salem Nomo, Tasinga, Vanuatu Brewery Limited, VBL Media, VIT, Vodafone, Xero, Digicel, Bred Bank and AJC.Some businesses presented their new big ideas, some presented new digital features while others showcased software that plays an essential role in their businesses, from 3-D printers to online payments and free advertisements sites. Digital innovation was once overlooked because of lack of understanding but has found its place as each presentation bringing an exciting new prospect.All these presentations were accompanied by an explanation of the purpose and the use of these digital components, why they are necessary to the business and how they can be utilized by other people as well as businesses. Most of the demonstrations illustrated how to use and manoeuvre the digital platform.Yumi Work believes that Vanuatu is ready to use more digital solutions. The idea association recognizes that this digital transformation can only be achieved by business environments adopting more structure, that is the purpose of the idea association.After the exciting presentations a round table discussion was held. Sitting on the discussion panel were several experienced and knowledgeable people with different work backgrounds, ideas, opinions and experiences with technology. The panel was made up of: Marc Gérard — president of the Idea association, Tony Crétier — Director of VBL Media, Jean Pierre Nirua — Vice Chancellor of the National University of Vanuatu, Barlen Lutchmoodoo — CEO of Vodafone Vanuatu, Philippe Noirot — Deputy Director of Bred Bank Vanuatu, Martin St Hilaire — Managing Partner at AJC Vanuatu and James Rory — Vice president of the Idea association.The discussion focused on digital readiness and the multiple factors associated with its environments.Jean Pierre Nirua had shared his experience with technology during the discussion saying it is a must to train the population to use technology, breach the gap (between digitally literate people and non-digitally literate people). A typical Ni-van client will not trust digitalized services offered by banks. How can banks assure people that their information is safe?Further into the discussion, Martin St Hilaire shares that if things are digitalized a lot of things will move faster and be more transparent, resulting in people trusting the government and its processes more.Such things like filing an application, a work permit, the health system or applying for a driver’s license can all be digitalized. This will greatly help the environment, as the community will be saving plastic and paper by digitalizing these documents instead of making hard copies.Mr. Hilaire added, “we do not have to make the oceans dirty before we start cleaning them”.The discussion brought up solutions as well as more questions where digitalizing is concerned."

In any time, it has been identified that people living with disability are especially vulnerable and as such they are the only beneficiaries for this program in SHEFA.The Vanuatu Society of People Living with Disability (VSPD) along with Shefa Provincial Council are in the process of identifying the individuals living with disabilities who will become the beneficiaries and receive a special tap and pay card with credit on it through the Oxfam program. This enables the beneficiaries and their families to decide what they need and wish to purchase and restores dignity and choice to the beneficiaries, across a network of local shops and vendors.One of the unique aspects of the Unblocked Cash Program is that by delivering support in terms of cash via a card payment system instead of more traditional aid which is often goods, this new approach supports local businesses in communities in allowing them to deliver services to the people. This in turn means the money stays in the local economy.VSPD has conducting a need assessments to identify household needs along with the updated data for people with disabilities in the area around Port Vila and offshore islands. VBRC in partnership with Oxfam is assisting to identify retail shops, hardware shops, pharmacies and local fresh food market vendors to be the service provider to the program participants; these service providers are selected, contracted, and then become the Vendors. Vendors are reimbursed weekly by Oxfam for the goods they sell to beneficiaries redeeming their cards.The Shefa program is scheduled to operate for 3 months commencing in Mid-February to end of April. It will provide stimulus to the economy which will assist the families in need, and also support businesses in the provinces during this crisis.The programme has also demonstrated a market multiplier effect – every 1vt spent generates at least 3.5vt (3.5x) in market activity through the program.The successful business owners that will be identified by VBRC will be the first on Efate to drive the system which is a new mode of payment through blockchain and mobile phone technology. Beneficiaries simply tap their card against a vendor phone to complete payment, with categories of purchase and expenditure amounts tracked in real time. This will be an exciting opportunity for these vendors as the program extends to the grassroots which in turn upgrades their skills to another level of using digital technology.The program also encourages women business owners around Efate and offshore islands as this program strongly encourages involvement of women and support of their business skills. This will be a challenging experience for these women especially market vendors but a good opportunity for them to participate and learn a new method of doing business. This will in turn give them confidence and build their skills in financial literature which will be a good example to other market vendors.Oxfam would like to acknowledge the generous funding support of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade for their support of this program."

John says marketing, finance management and decision-making are what helped him grow his business.Harry feels that the business coaching helped him gain confidence and now he presents himself well in public.He feels he needs a bit more accounting training, especially in VAT returns.Harry has been able to employ a staff of one, who gives quality service. He also says he has managed to outsource some configuration and installation.Cash flow is still a major challenge with his business, he said.Harry also runs an electrical company, Pacific Tech Electrical, which he says did not perform well at the start, however it has improved since July last year, thanks to V–Lab.With the electrical company he says unpaid invoices by customers are a burden as that also makes it hard for him to pay his bills.Harry hopes to have a permanent office and also recruit an agent on Santo, as well as a full-time manager. He currently has 5 staff for Pacific Tech Electrical.Pacific Tech Electrical currently has currently 5 contracts they are working on, one of which is the correctional facility at Stade.Harry is happy to employ people as that way he gives them an opportunity to support their family.Harry thanks V–Lab for everything, especially their training on advertisement as that was what brought in more customers.Vincent BenVincent Ben who owns Lokol Praes, thanks the V–Lab team and the sponsors for everything. Ben believes there should be more activities for incubees to learn from each other. He also feels there should be more visits during trainings to businesses of similar nature to see how they are doing and learn how they started and grew.Lokol Praes was established in late 2019, and slowly grew to success in early 2020, however things didn’t go well as people could not pay upfront and with a failed investment on Malekula, sales dropped.Despite this little downfall, Ben feels that he is getting back now that he has an extended product range which includes kitchen utensils and jewelry which he imports from New Zealand. He employs two part-time staff and he will soon launch an e-commerce website and also have payment options available through Bred Bank, National Bank of Vanuatu and Vodafone’s M-vatu system.Ben is now optimizing with local shipping companies to secure deals with the best ones to deliver the goods to his customers throughout Vanuatu. He prefers sea transport as he says, Air Vanuatu is too expensive and with sea transport, the ships cover more of Vanuatu than planes.Jack KalsarapJack Kalsarap and his wife Mary, are part of Mama’s Life Vanuatu who manufacture reusable nappies for babies and reusable menstrual pads for the ladies.Mr. Kalsarap says they support women to take control of their own lives. He says he has really learnt a lot from V–Lab over a year as the coaching taught him a lot.He says V–Lab taught him well on how to present himself and his products to people of all walks of life.Mr. Kalsarap says one thing V–Lab should do in future is to individually assess each business individually in the beginning as all businesses are different in nature.Kalsarap says he enjoyed learning from other business people and says V-Lab should encourage international partnership in future.He says 2020 was a good year for them as they travelled to the Torba Province to showcase their products.Kalsarap believes that with more donor funding, the Nappy Pilot with Bambino Mio and Savvy should be a success.He says tampon orders increased after tropical cyclone Harold and with the COVID-19 outbreak, they also manufactured face masks.Kalsarap says consistency of staff is something he would like to keep. He also aims to establish more regular customers. It is also a big wish of his to see the government ban disposable diapers one day.He wants to get a bigger site in the near future and more equipment for mass production as he hopes to expand to other islands of Vanuatu. He appeals to the government of the day to upgrade local businesses so they can in turn grow the economy of the country. With that being said, he is also appealing to the government to sponsor a machine for mass production.Rebecca BogiriRebecca Bogiri who owns Isi Kakai, says the three important things she learnt from V-Lab as an incubee are price strategy, the benefits of having a coach and how to make use of social media to market products.Bogiri encourages future trainees to understand their own pace, be willing to try new things and to always make use of all resources at their disposal.If she were to do this training again, she would like it to allow incubees to determine content of trainings prior to training delivery so it is responsive to their needs. She would also like it to be for a shorter period, so it can maintain momentum. Best period is between March and October.She would also like the program to include training needed by SMEs transitioning into sustainable businesses in areas like: VAT basics, understanding the loan process, writing business plans and project proposals."

Since showing his interest in potato farming back in 2019, farmer Harry purchased a two-wheeled rotavator to expand his potato farm in 2020.“With the subsidy, I see the opportunity to diversify and introduce other crops, especially Wailu yams to supply the Port Vila market,” says farmer Harry.Harry became the first beneficiary after the Ministry of Agriculture Livestock Forestry Fisheries and Biosecurity (MALFFB) issued the first machines and materials under the National Subsidy Initiative, more commonly known as the 70/30 and 60/40 subsidy on Thursday this week.Since its launching on December 17th 2020, this is the first issue following due process where interested individuals need to compete 5 steps-application process in order to be eligible for the subsidy.MALFFB DG, Moses Amos said this initiative will stimulate an increase in primary production where farmers are given an opportunity to own a machine, tools or boats and equipment to aide production thus taking primary production to new heights in 2021.DG Amos says the festive season has affected the subsidy process thus it took over four weeks to apply till the machine is delivered to the farmer today.However, he adds “Be rest assured that the MALFFB team will need three days to scrutinize all subsidy applications and each applicant will receive their items nor later than a week”.The six-steps application process requires interested applicants to register with the Vanuatu Primary Producers Authority (VPPA). Once the registration is complete, the applicant’s registration and request for items is submitted to a Department Assessment Committee for vetting. After the vetting process is complete, the approved list is submitted to the Director for each respective Department who then signs a letter of approval allowing the applicant to pay for the item under the subsidy initiative.The applicant then pays for the discounted 30 or 40 percent to the government cashier, produces their receipt to the MALFFB Project Management Unit to collect their item. The final step is the Monitoring and Evaluation where officers in the respective MALFFB departments will evaluate the use of these machines/tools/equipment in each quarter or twelve-months period.Prior to receiving each item purchased under the subsidy, applicants are required to sign a contract agreement between MALFFB and the applicant. The contract agreement stipulates conditions under the subsidy program, one of which does not allow applicants to trade items purchased under the subsidy program.The agreement also spells out the period whereby the Monitoring and Evaluation activity will be conducted.The handover on Thursday marks the beginning of the roll-out of the subsidy initiative.According to current data, Departmental Assessment teams are assessing approximately a hundred-plus applications per week.Application forms for the subsidy can be obtained in any offices for the Departments of Agriculture Livestock Forestry Fishery and Biosecurity across the country.Any queries regarding the application and its process can be directed to MALFFB Extension officers in the provinces or the main offices in Port Vila."

In Vanuatu, the staff of the Shefa Provincial Health Department hosted an afternoon tea to thank their health colleagues from other provinces for their solidarity and hard work to fight successfully against COVID-19.There has never been any case of COVID-19 in Vanuatu communities. Some people could say Vanuatu was lucky and they would be right. However, luck cannot be the only answer. After all Vanuatu is amongst a handful countries around the world with no active COVID-19 case. Preventing a world pandemic away from entering its communities requires strategic decisions and a good coordination of different organisations and management of workers’ skills.Both the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and the Ministry of Health have successfully led the response to fight COVID-19 in partnership with the Shefa Province. The efforts focussed on developing an effective quarantine system to ensure virus did not spread in the communities. Different partners participated actively into the response including the provincial health workers.The Ministry of Health called on them to come to Port Vila to support their health colleagues from the Shefa Province and to learn COVID-19 preparedness response skills.Lolyne Jeremiah Arnhambat, Provincial Public Health Manager for Tafea Province, is one of them. She has been in Port Vila since 5 November. With the last 2020 repatriates out of quarantine she can now go back home with her family.“During these two months I have learnt so much. Participating in the quarantine system provides me the confidence to run similar operations in Tafea province if there would be a case,” said Lolyne.The Ministry of Health also provided the Provincial Health Workers with a set of COVID-19 preparedness response training. This included support to develop surveillance plan for their province and to detect people facing mental health issues while in quarantine.Shefa Provincial Public Health Manager, Obed Manwo, Shefa Provincial Health Administrator, Morris Amos, and Shefa Provincial Assistant Nursing Services Manager, Barry Saniel, thanked warmly their colleagues from other provinces for participating in the national COVID-19 response.“It has been an incredible journey. Thank you [provincial health workers] for leaving your family and your normal duties for helping Shefa Provincial Health Department in this fight against COVID-19. We faced a lot of challenges, but we can be proud to say we met our objective. Vanuatu remains COVID-19 free,” said Obed Manwo.“No one can achieve alone or in isolation what we have accomplished. We proved that working altogether in combining our health resources from national and provincial levels work,” said Morris Amos.They also thanked World Vision Vanuatu and the Australian Government for their ongoing support to develop and implement Vanuatu’s quarantine system."

It is taking us a lot of time we at CK, we are trying to help.”Mr. Bernier said he cannot be playing favourites with the tenants and grant them different concessions, everyone must be treated equally.“I can’t give in a favour for someone and the other one hasn’t got the same favour, if I give 50% then I have to give 50% to everybody, then if the landlord has issue with financials then it becomes my issue as well, so we have to be careful what we do for each of the tenant because we have to protect the interest of our landlord.”Keeping the delicate relationship stable between agent, landlord and tenant has gotten a lot more difficult with the inclusion of the pandemic, which the Managing Director of CK says is a first in his career.“We have never had that sort of issue before, I remember Pam in 2015 where you had damaged houses but at least we knew what exactly needed to done, we have to fix the houses we have to get them sorted out and we have tenants moving in.“At the moment we have people vacating and we have empty houses to manage and we have no income and we have to accommodate with the problem for the landlord, accommodate with the problem for the tenant, so there’s lots of issue and it’s never been like this before, I have never had in 30yrs as a registered agent those sorts of issues.”So far, no tenant has been issued a foreclosure notice due to unpaid rent and Mr. Bernier said they are doing everything in their power to help the tenants pull through this difficult time.“We have no foreclosure yet going on, we have accommodated everybody, we have sent letters to say to the people if they don’t pay we will stop the lease but until now there has been no foreclosure yet.”According to Mr. Bernier, for the commercial tenants who are finding it difficult to meet their rent, he has invited them to visit his staff at the Caillard & Kaddour office and they will try and assist with the help of the landlord.“As much as I can I am trying to help everyone in the situation and some people have to come and talk to us in the office as well. Come and discuss, tell us what they are doing to help their business, it’s like a bank, we have to understand exactly their situation, we will help,” he said.“People should come and talk to us about their situation, I have the staff ready to discuss, as long as we understand their situation we can see what we can do and what the landlord is willing to do.”In the meantime, Mr. Bernier advised the commercial tenants of Port Vila to be happy with the reduction because it’s better than nothing.“Having a reduction in rent is better than nothing, my commission is based on income if that income is zero I don’t get any income so I would rather have a reduction in income than nothing, I’m trying to help but in some cases, we cannot go over than 30% and in some cases, we will look at it."

Our survey confirms what we are hearing from businesses, that the pressures have not eased and financial pressures are compounding due to no revenue.“As the year draws to a close we look to 2021 to provide the respite and global response needed to ensure the survival of so many Pacific enterprises. The announcement of a Transtasman bubble and the development of vaccines providing the first concrete glimmers of hope on a road towards recovery.”According to the December survey, nearly a quarter of businesses remain temporarily closed while another 43 per cent are only partly operational.The survey reports that the top three challenges as a result of COVID-19 remain poor cashflow, uncertainty on how long the crisis will last and the impact of closed international borders.The top three initiatives that businesses have been calling for are financial support, reviews on financial position and assistance with improving online commerce capabilities.PTI Australia continues to use the data from the PTI Pacific Business Monitor to champion the Pacific’s private sector at a regional level and bring a spotlight to the current reality Pacific businesses are facing.It reinforces the findings from the Lowy Institute that the Pacific is staring at the potential ‘lost decade’ due to economic damage of COVID-19, projecting the average income per person in the Pacific will no recover to its 2019 levels until 2028.“We also use this data to help inform the design and delivery of our programs across the 16 Pacific nations we service. This month we launched our Social Media for e-Business scholarship program, a bespoke 6-week program designed specifically for Pacific businesses to help bridge the digital capability gap and enhance e-commerce skills,” said Jarvis."
416,https://vbr.vu/news/ahapi-stationery-opens-in-luganville/,2020-12-29 05:07:00,Ahapi Stationery opens in Luganville,"By Len Garae“My message to all schools and parents is for them to come and see what Ahapi Stationery has to offer. If we don’t have available what they want, we would be most happy to source them for our clients. We are there and we want to be the best stationery in the country.”Indigenous investor, Johnny Arnhambat, makes the statement after launching the second Ahapi Stationery in Luganville on December 20, after the first bookshop by the same ni-Vanuatu Company, was launched in Port Vila on January 19 this year.For the successful ni-Vanuatu investor, indeed action speaks louder than words because the launching in the Northern Town was mistaken by locals for a foreign investment by an expatriate investor.But the ni-Vanuatu investor shrugged it off as just one of those developments that have to emerge at this time especially immediately after the country’s graduation from its former Least Developed Country to Developing Country status.Interestingly the Luganville Ahapi Stationery with its competitive prices seems set to have opened its doors at the right time, especially as it already has Torba Province, Sanma Province, Penama Province and Malampa Province in its sight.In other words the company is prepared to cater for the stationery interests of all four Provinces too.“It’s quite a big building with so much there for people to eye shop to find so much varieties of goods in terms of stationery and other services, we can be of assistance to them to help them to get their specific orders,” explains the investor.“At the same time I think it is only proper just after our graduation from LDC, we need to prove ourselves that economically, we are capable to prove to the outside world that we are able to stand on our own feet.”He says the timing is right for the Government to play its part while the private sector also participates actively in the economic development of the country.“At the same time we want to ensure that the economic development of our Provinces is also on the same pace of development, to confirm that 2020 will go down in history as our country’s economic springboard from which we as a company, have embarked on our continuing economic vision to connect with Luganville followed by Tanna perhaps next year then Malekula,” Arnhambat continues. He is optimistic that Luganville Ahapi Stationery is going to be a “trading centre” for all four Northern Provinces.“Also we believe that as a ni-Vanuatu company, we have to prove that celebrating 40 years of Independence means that we are capable of exploiting our own resources to actively contribute to the economic development of our country”, he adds.“But we must also acknowledge our foreign investors including the Chinese, for being there before us to maintain our country’s economic prowess to help project us to Developing Country level”.But Arnhambat admits that the country’s graduation has a short list of ni-Vanuatu investors to its name. What he wants to see is more ni-Vanuatu stepping out from the safety net of spectators to join the current indigenous investors to play an active role in the economic development of the country.“We go to school to graduate to return home to work. Perhaps after a while, we have to start challenging ourselves as to what we as individuals, can do to contribute towards the development of this nation”, he insist.Arnhambat says the purpose of launching Ahapi Stationery in Luganville is to “assist Luganville Stationery” to provide an alternative service to the population.“We want to set the bar high so that our local clients appreciate that we are there to provide another professional service to assist children to access their school items for their studies,” he says.Asked what prompted him to take the risk after investing millions at Go Eton, the Ahapi Stationary in Port Vila and now in Luganville, he replies, “Our parents drummed the message home to us when we were kids that we had to study well to make sure we did not return to where they were”.The name Arnhambat is well respected on Malekula to this day as once belonging to a paramount chief of the Big Nambas Tribe in North West Malekula.Johnny Arnhambat has moved on to marry his wife Mary from Ambae, and they have three adult children – two girls and a son as well as grandchildren.He and his wife have made sure that their siblings are playing an active role in the running of the family businesses.In fact to live up to his determination to involve his entire family in the business, the investor ensured that the Stationery in Luganville was officially opened by two of his grandchildren"

The former seasonal worker says a lot of returnees have wanted to start businesses for themselves, however the main barrier to this is having financial capital to start. He says though a lot of returnees have land and have started some small-scale farming projects, other thing which they lack is knowledge in book keeping, financial management and marketing.John says if all returnees become entrepreneurs, they will give a major boost to the national economy. He says everyone will have money and be rich. He says if these returnees start businesses, they would then create employment while also contributing more to the national income in the form of taxes and business licenses. Using Port Vila as an example, he says if more businesses are set up, they would branch out from the CBD to the other suburbs and even the nearby areas such as Etas and Teouma which John believes could eventually become new towns.John says V-Lab along with other stakeholders, should establish business incubators in Luganville, Lakatoro and Lenakel so that businesses grow and there is more contribution to the economy.John currently runs an architectural business which also touches on plumbing and electrical wiring. The former seasonal worker now turned recruiting agent, says this time he has ventured into designing and building eco-friendly homes which he markets especially to the returned seasonal workers.John says most of the time workers coming home want to build houses with indoor access to both electricity and water. Since most of the workers come from rural areas, John says most people want a home which is furnished so he has designed homes through the isodo eco-friendly construction methods. He specifically designs these homes to be powered by solar energy and other renewable power sources."

Globally the virus has cost more than one million people their lives, the world economy is predicted to shrink by 4.4 per cent in 2020 and global debt has ballooned. Our own region has not been immune. We have seen New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Guam and French Polynesia facing the virus head-on. In Australia, there have been over 27,000 cases and over 900 deaths.The Pacific region’s economy has also been disproportionately affected and is predicted to shrink by 6.1 per cent.I applaud Vanuatu for responding early to COVID-19 and its status as one of the few countries in the world where no cases have been recorded. Australia has been proud to stand with Vanuatu in partnership to support COVID-19 preparedness and mitigate the economic shock. We have pivoted our aid program to help strengthen Vanuatu’s health system, to support social stability and essential service delivery, to promote economic recovery, and to protect the most vulnerable including women, girls and people with disabilities.We have also invested an additional 1.3 billion vatu in health security and economic support measures, including funding for front line health workers, medical equipment and health infrastructure, and supporting schools, communities and vulnerable households, including through cash-transfers. Of course, responding to Vanuatu’s broader priorities, our partnership also continues in traditional areas of education, skills, policing and justice, security, economic governance, agriculture, infrastructure and humanitarian response.While we will continue to provide this broader support, there is no higher priority right now for Australia – and for our Pacific partners – than a COVID-19 vaccine. Across the world, scientists are racing to produce a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible. Once it is developed and approved, and its safety rigorously assessed, a vaccine will enable our economies to reopen and will help to keep our people healthy.Australia believes that once a safe and effective vaccine is developed there is a moral responsibility that it be shared with the world. That is why our Foreign Minister, Minister for International Development and the Pacific and Health Minister have announced a new 39 billion vatu Regional Vaccine Access and Health Security initiative to ensure Vanuatu, as well as other Pacific island countries and Timor-Leste, can achieve full COVID-19 vaccine coverage. Australia will also make a significant contribution towards meeting the needs of Southeast Asia. This is an important step towards ensuring our region can recover, rebuild and prosper.Building on our long-term partnership to strengthen Vanuatu’s health system, Australia will also provide support for Vanuatu to assess the safety and effectiveness of vaccine candidates, as well as helping to ensure health systems and workforces are ready to deliver vaccines as soon as they are available.This new initiative is in addition to Australia’s 6.3 billion vatu commitment to the multilateral COVAX Facility, which will support access to sufficient doses to meet the needs of the highest risk populations globally.These commitments build on and complement Australia’s existing partnership with the Vanuatu Government to fight the impacts of the pandemic.Our joint efforts will help to save lives. They will promote regional stability and economic recovery. And they will allow us all to get back to a more normal existence as soon as we possibly can.Just as we always have, in good times and in bad, Australia will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder in solidarity with Vanuatu and the rest of our Pacific Family."

In the event of a cyclone, members will be able to get support to rebuild houses and children go back to school.“In Melanesian countries, funerals are expensive and saving money is not a culture. Social benefits of VNPF members must be addressed.”According to GM Achary, the bill addresses all issues which were raised by the Commission of Inquiry (CoI) into VNPF in 2016.“Basically, the bill covers the appointment and conduct of the board, code of conduct for board members, staff and senior staff,” he conveyed.“Any person who breach these conducts can be penalized by a specialized committee. A disciplinary committee will also be established.“The new legislation specifies the role of VNPF as a trustee and powers of inspectors.”Another area covered by the bill is the reduction of withdrawal age, he said.“Members can withdraw only 50% at the age of 47 and up above from their Medisave and Investment accounts, excluding Retirement.”GM Achary said the changes expected from the Bill for the VNPF (Amendment) Act will bring significant changes.He added VNPF is looking at investing on electricity, cable and telecommunication in the infrastructure sector.Since the establishment of the Act in 1987, the Act has undergone only one amendment in 2007."

These ministries include PMO, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and Ministry of Education and Training. He said all agencies currently under the Ministry of Justice are important and the Government will ensure the Hall of Justice remains a priority to address.Consultations were done within the government to decide on which ministry would be replaced, prior to a final decision been made, the PRO confirmed.This policy decision was approved by the Council of Ministers (CoM) as per the CoM decision 179 at Lakatoro, Malekula on October 15, 2020.Prime Minister Bob Loughman tabled the policy direction as priority efforts to develop the productive sector. It is the government’s intention to put more emphasis on the development of the primary sector. The current government under the leadership of PM Loughman acknowledge that a separate Ministry should be allocated to Fisheries as this sector covers a wide range of important areas. It is about time that ni-Vanuatu tap into marine resources; not only focusing only on small scale fishing opportunities, but, expand their priorities to value added products to boost the country’s economy. Vanuatu is rich in its marine resources but it is not utilising and benefitting fully from its resources. With the new ministry, Vanuatu would be contesting cannery processing and other major fishery and ocean related revenue generating avenues, as well as significant issues such as ocean boundaries and Flags of convenience. PRO Vurobaravu confirmed a Taskforce will be appointed to oversee the restructuring and implementation of the new policy direction. Members of the Taskforce will comprise the Director General (DG) to the PMO, who is also the Chairman of the Taskforce; First Political Advisor (PA) to the PM; Chairman of Public Service Commission (PSC); DG of Finance and Economic Management; DG of Foreign Affairs and External Trades, who currently is the chairman of Maritime Boundary; DG of Agriculture, Fisheries, Forestry, Livestock and Biosecurity; DG of Internal Affairs; DG of Justice and Community Services; and Acting DG of Public Works and Public Utilities."
426,https://vbr.vu/news/micro-insurance-for-staff/,2020-11-02 04:21:00,Micro Insurance for Staff,"VanCare Insurance Limited has launched a new Micro Insurance product managed by Vanuatu Insurance Brokers that provides workers with Life insurance and cover for funeral expenses, personal accident, and loss of a dwelling through fire. This is the first insurance policy of its kind in Vanuatu and the Pacific Island region.VanCare Insurance said, “We pride ourselves in being able to provide innovative insurance products to the market that suits the needs of its people. The bundled micro insurance product has been successfully rolled out in Fiji through our parent company FijiCare Insurance Limited and we are now working on offering this product in other Pacific Island countries so that people from different sectors are able to get insurance coverage.”The policy provides Vt200,000 life and funeral insurance, Vt150,000 permanent injury from personal accident and Vt150,000 from loss of their residence from fire even if they are a tenant. The quick payment provides some assistance during their time of need.Pikinini Playtime is one of the first employers to take out this cover and has insured more than seventy (70) of its teaching and administrative staff. The Business Manager of Pikinini Playtime, Mr Tony Batten, said “One of the greatest challenges for education in Vanuatu is maintaining a motivated, skilled teaching staff who are reliable and punctual. In many schools, teacher absenteeism continually disrupts classes and demotivates students and this is a key factor contributing to the very poor standard of education. Our staff are competent, reliable, and highly motivated and we want to reward them by providing them with a safe secure working environment. We work closely with our insurance broker to maximise the effectiveness of our insurance budget and we are very appreciative of this opportunity to show leadership within the education sector.”One of the tragic realities of life in Vanuatu is that people die of illnesses that would be readily treatable in other countries. Pikinini Playtime has lost two staff and a student from treatable conditions since 2012.Mr Batten went on to explain how increasing pay scales is often unproductive as many staff are the sole bread winners in their family and increasing take home pay simply means that “fulap moskito blo famili oli stikim nek blo staf”.He said, “The greatest staff challenges we face are dealing with domestic violence and providing staff with financial security. We believe this insurance policy is one way we can alleviate some of the stresses and worries that our staff carry and that this will help them to perform their tasks with confidence. If they were to take out a similar policy personally, then it would only be a short time before some other ‘need’ overwhelmed their capacity to pay the premium. We believe by paying the premium for our staff we will be making sure that each one is reliably covered and that they can be confident that in the event of a tragedy, their family will have financial assistance.”"

Labour plays an important role to the economic growth of Vanuatu.“Success of individual workers brings forth the success of individual families, communities, provinces and Vanuatu as a whole. This project is a milestone in this wave of success.”Commissioner Meltenoven said “On behalf of the Department of labour, I would like to thank the Government of Australia for funding this project. This achievement, the renovation and refurbishment of the new Department of Labour office reflects the great strength of the 40 years of partnership between the Governments of Vanuatu and Australia.”The Vanuatu labour mobility program has grown a lot over the last ten years, and in 2019 a total of more than 10,000 workers travelled to Australia and New Zealand with the Seasonal Worker Programme, Pacific Labour Scheme and RSE. The newly refurbished Department of Labour building will enable the delivery of training and services to the departing workers and provide much needed office space for the Department, including the Employment Services Unit that manages the implementation of labour mobility programs. This increased office space will also support the Department of Labour’s national labour initiatives, as well as all the other roles that it performs such as conducting OHS checks, preparing and approving work permits, and facilitating work place mediation.The funding of this renovation and refurbishment project equates to 65 million vatu. The Public Works Department within the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities is responsible for implementing the project, in partnership with the Department of Labour and the Australian Government. Part of the funding will be allocated towards building a new training space which will be used for seasonal worker Pre-Departure Briefings and other related ‘work ready’ and ‘reintegration’ training for workers."

Reading, however, is not enough and so there are some questions for reflection at the end of each poem allowing readers to think about the powerful lessons found within.Teachers will especially welcome this anthology, as it provides creative learning opportunities for students to critique both poetry and visual art.It also provides a selection of older and newer poems by seasoned and emerging writers bringing together a cross-generational narrative of Pacific stories of struggle and survival.For many students, it will be an introduction to the safe space that creative expression provides for otherwise difficult or sensitive conversations.For others, it reinforces the critical cultural role that the arts play in knowledge and learning. The creative works and activities in this collection present multiple opportunities for students and teachers alike to reflect on their own values and beliefs and to connect with the broader theme of unity and humanity.The MoET said the handing over of the anthology of Pacific poems is a milestone through the Social Citizenship program funded by the European Union through the Social Citizenship Education Programme (SCE), led by SPC’s Human Rights and Social Development (HRSD) division under the Pacific Partnership to End Violence Against Women and Girls Programme (Pacific Partnership).SCE programme aims to enhance Pacific youth’s formal in-school and informal education on gender equality and on the prevention of violence against women and girls.The Pacific Partnership has three outcome areas jointly coordinated by HRSD, Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (Forum Secretariat) and UN Women’s Fiji Multi-Country Office."

Hence, the introduction of new medical rating charts is a good improvement to the health sector.”Luke, who was selected as a trainer for the next Advanced Life Support Training course said, “knowing that a patient’s life is in your hands, you must make sure that you are prepared and confident enough to save that person at all cost.”The 2-day workshop was co-supported by the Australian Government through the Australian Volunteers Program (AVP) and the Vanuatu Health Program."

In particular, I want to highlight the importance of the transition to the use of the national ID card in future elections. Once the transition will be completed, the electoral rolls will be extracted from the Civil Registry database”.He added, “a comprehensive data cleaning exercise and field validation the data of the voter lists is currently ongoing.

UNDP and New Zealand are keen to support democratic processes in Vanuatu. Engagement is the first ingredient of success.New Zealand’s Foreign Affairs Minister Nanaia Mahuta said in her official announcement, “This project, valued at $5 million over the next four years, will help the Vanuatu Electoral Office to improve voter enrolment and the quality of the voter roll, and enhance public confidence in the electoral system.“New Zealand and Vanuatu share a commitment to democracy and free and fair elections. We are proud to be working with the UNDP and the Vanuatu electoral authorities to deliver the VEEP project,” she added.New Zealand’s High Commissioner to Vanuatu, Jonathan Schwass said, “New Zealand has been working with UNDP and the Vanuatu Electoral Office since 2018, to strengthen the capacity of the electoral authorities. After the successful implementation of VEEP we are proud of the results achieved and keen to support another phase of this UNDP initiative. We look forward to UNDP and NZ consolidating lessons learnt in the 2020 general elections to further strengthen electoral processes in Vanuatu.”The UNDP Pacific Office in Fiji, Resident Representative, Levan Bouadze, said, “Vanuatu is one of the first countries in the Pacific to introduce an ID card to its citizens, despite limited resources, very complicated geography and some areas with very limited access to information.“This is a tremendous achievement for both the Department of Civil Registry and Vital Statistics and the Vanuatu Electoral Office.“At the same time, it is a significant cost-saving measure for the Government and an essential begin of having accurate population statistics to identify appropriate strategic responses to development challenges. We are happy to continue working on consolidating results already achieved through VEEP phase I (2017-2020) and address issues identified in the March general election.“We are ready to provide assistance to any electoral reform measures that may be considered relevant by the electoral stakeholders.”The Department of Civil Registry and Vital Statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs will be a new partner of the project, along with the Electoral Commission.VEEP-II will also focus on the findings of the first-ever nationwide post-electoral review which evaluated the 2020 general election. It aims at broadening the partnership of the electoral authorities with the Civil Society Organisations to increase electoral awareness to citizens."

SANMA Province and Luganville will receive VT1 million each. The major portion of the funds will be used in Port Vila.In recognition of the 4th of December being the date set aside for this significant event, CoM also endorsed that date as a public holiday. A recommendation has been made to the Prime Minister and due procedures will be followed prior to an official declaration from the Head of State.Development partners also reaffirmed their support towards the two-day celebrations.Activities that will highlight the two-day event in Port Vila include Talkback Shows, panel discussions on topics surrounding LDCs and what it means to graduate from the LDC category.There will be cultural entertainment from Vanuatu and Pacific community groups, sports competitions and more entertainments from popular bands and fireworks display to end the celebration.Speaking as the former Yumi 40 National Coordinator, Samuel stressed that this event is probably the most biggest achievement for Vanuatu that deserved the celebration.“This is a very important year, we are mature as a nation,” he said.“The United Nations has recognized us and granted our fight to gain our political independence in 1980. A lot of people have worked together towards achieving this goal. The UN has also recognised that.“It is worthwhile for Vanuatu to celebrate this graduation. We are demonstrating to the world that Vanuatu is capable and matured and now moving onto another level. Vanuatu must be proud, hence, set aside these days to acknowledge previous governments, this government, former leaders and all who have put effort and contributed towards this journey.“While we celebrate, we not only celebrate, but a lot of educational awareness has to be done.”The National Coordinating Committee for the LDC Graduation event have provided explanations to clarify this issue. One of the important asked questions is why Vanuatu is graduating.“A country can graduate from the LDC category by meeting two of the three criteria at two consecutive triennial meetings of the UN Committee for Development Policy (CDP),” the Committee members explained.“Since 1991, Vanuatu has consistently met the per capita income graduation threshold, and in 2012, became eligible under the ‘income only’ criterion, having over twice the income per capita threshold. Vanuatu has never come close to meeting the economic vulnerability threshold.“The CDP made special mention of the fact that Vanuatu remains ‘highly vulnerable’ and recommended that ‘donors and trading partners extend the maximum possible flexibility and support’ following graduation."

This will include working with commercial banks, money transfer operators, and other key stakeholders in the remittance sector. If successful, this work will also help drive financial inclusion in the region.The Governors of the nine central banks thank all of those involved in the work to date, including: International Monetary Fund, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, the UN’s Capital Development Fund, Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade; New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs; and all other Pacific Island country government agencies that have made contributions to date."

Although the pandemic has not yet spread in an alarming manner in the region, it is essential to provide assistance to these countries and territories in their efforts to stem propagation while strengthening their medium- and long-term capacity to cope better with future risks.This additional funding will therefore make it possible to continue to develop their preparation, response and adaptation capacities as regards the health effects of climate change, through the establishment of robust public health surveillance systems and a coherent array of services, accessible to all, for the surveillance of emerging diseases in the region.“Our communicable disease response plan in the region is based on our ability to respond immediately to country needs, while preparing for the future,” explained Paula Vivili, Director of the SPC Public Health Division.“The novel coronavirus surprised the whole world and the pandemic was able to spread because many countries were not well enough prepared to cope with it. Nobody knows what may happen tomorrow in terms of health, and in a region vulnerable to epidemics, such as the Pacific, we must have infrastructure in place to be able to face any scenario.”At the project launch, Philippe Renault, the AFD’s Regional Director for the Pacific based in Nouméa, emphasised that this project is “an ongoing strong commitment from AFD, because since its creation in 1996, PPHSN has always enjoyed French support. AFD is today again joining forces with SPC in order to strengthen Pacific Island country capacity in the areas of clinical services, surveillance and laboratory diagnosis, vector control and mitigation of the impacts of natural disasters on marginalised communities, including people with disabilities.”The project is being implemented in conjunction with PPHSN partners, in parallel with existing projects funded by ’Agence Française de Développement’ (AFD), the Australian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the European Union (EU), the French Pacific Fund (France), the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) and the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC)."

The vessel concluded its trip in Levuka, Fiji, on October 3, 2020.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic borders were closed and flights cancelled, leaving a lot of people stranded away from their respective countries.However, fishing in the WCPFC, IATTC and other regions continued as normal but presented a dilemma for the hardworking Fisheries Observers as flights were closed at all offloading ports in Asia as it is a “High Risk” COVID-19 Area.The Vanuatu Department of Fisheries then proposed the sea port repatriation to the National Disaster Management Office, health authorities, and all border agencies.Once authorization was acquired from the Vanuatu authorities, the vessel departed Levuka, Fiji, with Mr. Paolo on board on the 24th of October 2020 bound for Port Vila.All Vanuatu Seaport COVID-19 protocols were fully applied in ensuring that personnel involved in the repatriation were safe: Vessel arrived in port and berthed, once disembarked, the Fisheries Observer underwent COVID-19 checks by Health Officials, Customs and Immigration formalities applied, the vessel was then cleared by Customs prior to departure from Port Vila harbor on the same day.The overall disembarkation process lasted less than an hour.Mr. Paolo was then transported to the quarantine facility to undergo the required 14-day isolation period. Vanuatu Fisheries Observers play an important role in collecting fisheries data onboard Vanuatu licensed or flagged as well as foreign flagged vessels in Vanuatu and other waters.The data collected is used by national, regional and international fisheries bodies to make sound management decisions on fisheries resources. The work of a fisheries observer aboard a fishing vessel is not for the faint of heart.The department is grateful for the sacrifice these group of young men and women have made to ensure the utilization and management of Vanuatu’s fisheries resources are well documented.There are 10 Fisheries Observers still on active duty on various carrier vessels within the WCPFC Region and 4 on tuna Longline vessels based in Apia, Western Samoa under the Vanuatu National Observer Program. The Fisheries Department continues to maintain regular communication with the fisheries observers using their InReach 2-way satellite communication devices by sending messages, as well as satellite vessel monitoring of the vessels on which the observers are placed on. Regular communication is also maintained with vessel agents and owners to eventually repatriate all remaining Vanuatu fisheries observers when their respective trips end.The Department of Fisheries met the costs for the first repatriation."

New Zealand High Commissioner Johnathan Schwass highlighted the five key pillars in his speech, which includes; safeguarding the health of citizens and visitors; planning for moving people internationally and nationally in a COVID environment; ensuring tourism businesses are financially viable and ready to launch their products again when the time is right; helping to build international demand for Vanuatu tourism, including through messaging that Vanuatu wants to be part of the proposed New Zealand and Australia tourism bubble and finally ensuring good communications throughout Vanuatu about the changes taking place within the sector.“These five pillars will help shape New Zealand’s engagement in Vanuatu tourism over the next few years,” he affirmed. New Zealand has been Vanuatu’s core partner in the tourism development for five past years.“We have been proud to have supported the stunning marketing and brand development work that has been done by the Vanuatu Tourism Office (VTO) and to have been able to help build the policy capacity of the Department of Tourism.“We’re now nearing the end of our first phase of tourism assistance and we intend that support in the future.”Director General of Tourism, Roy Mickey Joy urged for a dynamic deliberation during the four-day event."

VFIPA could have done more. The number of jobs should double that figure by now.“VFIPA have faced challenges with projects being approved without implementation over the past years. It comes back to the investment environment of the country.”A lot of works needs to be done to tidy up the regulatory environment and policies on foreign investment, he said.“VFIPA needs to be able to promote genuine and sustainable foreign investment, something it has not been doing in the past due to insufficient promotional budget,” he stressed.VFIPA is developing its new investment promotion marketing strategy, he said. CEO Aru also said that he is looking at seeking legal clarity on the reserve investment list as defined under the law."

Well the owner believes it can only be divine intervention at work.Proprietor of ‘The Village’ café at Tanna Cine Plaza, Constance Yuriki Wei explained that it is the will of God that allowed her business to grow at a steady pace even though she opened a coffee shop without a clue on how to make a basic cuppa joe.“Before this I don’t have any knowledge on how to run or start a business, everything I have built from the café is from God,” Ms. Wei explained.“He has led me every step of the way, He has been my light through all this everything I have is because of Him and I have followed His steps. With zero business knowledge it can only be God Himself.”According to Ms. Wei, her customers are locally oriented, so the border closure hasn’t exactly stopped ‘the Villagers’ from entering The Village – “We are getting more and more Ni-Vans which we are happy to see, we are more local based.”However, the Good Lord isn’t exactly playing favourites, Ms. Wei stated that her and her mum have had their fair share of hardships, working at times up to 18hrs a day at a retail and takeaway shop took a toll on their relationship and health.“We never had any time to be together or even to sit down and have a proper meal, it really took a toll on her health, that’s when we thought we wanted to change, we didn’t want to live like that anymore, it wasn’t a life for us,” she said.“So we prayed and we thought what can we do to change our lives that’s when we saw an opening, a free space for rent and we thought it might be a good idea for us to do something else and make a change but we weren’t sure what to do so I said to mum, ‘what about a coffee shop?’ ”In an attempt to keep her mum from working herself to the bone, Ms. Wei decided to proceed with the café concept and invested in barrister training overseas.“I left overseas to do a proper barrister training course so I know everything that you need to do to make a good cuppa coffee and at the start when we started the business is to give people a nice cuppa coffee,” Ms. Wei said.The psychology student explained that a business expansion is not the priority and never will be, adding that the future ambitions of the café is tethered to something more, down to earth.“We didn’t start the café to make a big brand for ourselves we started it to make more quality time with family, and to create a warm environment for people we didn’t want it to become a commercial thing and it won’t.”Being a fulltime student and business owner, Ms. Wei says that despite the kerfuffle of a new endeavour, the rewards are starting to show since the change in concept from takeaway to café.“We are now able to have dinner together, go for walks or beach on a Sunday, it’s good, we are dividing the shift up and no one is over working, the café is more profitable because the clientele is more different, we have our regulars who knows our menu very well, it makes us feel very happy.”With a close-knit Christian staff of four promoting the tenets of the café, “Love, Grace and Joy” Ms. Wei attributes the continuous business achievements to the Man upstairs, “We are staying afloat because God provides and we have everything we need”."

This means only one person is travelling now, for every four people previously.This was conveyed via Airports Vanuatu Ltd (AVL)’s recent update to stakeholders on the importance of air access and the flow on implications to the lives of every Vanuatu resident.Borders closed since March; passenger traffic decimatedVanuatu’s borders have been closed for nearly six months under the State of Emergency.• Overall passenger traffic is 76% down on a year ago, meaning only one person is travelling now, for every four people previously.• Domestic flying recommenced relatively quickly in April, but capacity has been constrained by Air Vanuatu’s available fleet. The 68-seat ATR aircraft which has served Tanna, Santo and Port Vila has been stranded overseas during maintenance. Domestic passenger movements for the August quarter are down 56% on a year ago.• International air travel continues to operate in a limited capacity under the direction of the National Disaster Management Office to enable humanitarian relief, repatriation and cargo flights. Just over 3,000 international passengers travelled during the August quarter, 97% down on a year ago.Ni-Vanuatu impacted by reduced access to air travel everydayAVL believes air travel is essential for the social and economic health of our nation and our people. CEO, Jason Rakau, commented, “Air services are essential to every one of us, even though not everyone in Vanuatu actually flies. Delivery of the social aspects of The People’s Plan relating to health are under threat, without regular air access. Health, education, seasonal worker programmes, visiting technical specialists — many people are impacted by limited air services, resulting in constrained supply lines and freight. Air access is the key enabler of global connectivity and since the borders closed, without access to air travel and freight and limited sea freight, every Vanuatu resident will have seen an impact on their quality of life. We welcome the certainty that Air Vanuatu’s limited air services through to December have given our community. As a first step, fortnightly services will operate for cargo and repatriation to Auckland, Brisbane, Noumea and Nadi”.AVL committed to contributing to the Tamtam Bubble and working closely with other agenciesAVL has taken a prominent role behind the scenes in recovery planning and its key consideration in all decision making is public health and acting on the advice of the Ministry of Health. It is preparing for the reopening of borders when it is safe to do so, to welcome back international visitors and kickstart the larger economy. While COVID-19 situation remains challenging in Australia and New Zealand, AVL urge decision makers to continue to take a pragmatic approach to aviation, and work with ourselves, Air Vanuatu and the NDMO in the provision of flights which can bring critical cargo.Kevin Abel, General Manager Operations for AVL, commented, “We need to maintain our aviation assets for safe and compliant operations at an airport and airline level, to ensure that we are able to continue to operate essential air services through limited international flights operations commencing now, through to the end of the year, and then to be ready to reengage with the world, when the time is right”."

474,https://vbr.vu/news/vanuatu-company-to-sell-citizenship-to-stateless-people/,2020-09-11 03:39:00,Vanuatu company to sell citizenship to stateless people,"By Prianka SrinivasanVanuatu has become one of the few countries in the world to sell its citizenship to stateless and nomadic people.The company at the centre of the scheme, Vanuatu Lifestyle or VanLS, recently signed a deal with the Vanuatu government to sell citizenship to 300 stateless or nomadic people, who don’t have existing citizenship documents.But applications cost more more than $US130,000.Thi Tham Goiset, the director of Vanuatu Lifestyle said the new initiative is a way to support people who face discrimination in their homelands.“You have today some stateless people who are wealthy,” Ms Goiset said.“They can take the citizenship of Vanuatu so that their children can go to London to study, go to France to study.”Stateless people are individuals who have no identity documents that prove their citizenship.They can face persecution and forced displacement in countries that don’t recognise their nationality.The United Nations estimates there are more than 10 million stateless people in the world today.That includes the Rohingya, an ethnic minority who live in the Southeast Asian country of Myanmar, but aren’t recognised as its citizens, and also some people living in Europe’s former Soviet Union countries, who lost their citizenship when countries like Estonia gained independence.Laszlo Kiss, a citizenship agent based in Malta who has partnered with Vanuatu Lifestyle to market Vanuatu passports to stateless people, told Pacific Beat he can easily sell these new passports.“We are talking about 300 possible applicants,” Mr Kiss said.“Even in Estonia which is a very small country, 80,000 people are stateless, so I have no doubts we would be able to fulfill that.”Vanuatu’s controversial ‘passports for sale’ programs have allowed people around the world to pay for ni-Vanuatu citizenship.The initiative brought in about 30 per cent of Vanuatu’s national income last year, and the Vanuatu Citizenship Commission has confirmed to Pacific Beat that they’ve already had more than successful 700 applicants this year.Mr Kiss says Vanuatu stands to make a significant income, at a time when its tourism industry is being hit by the pandemic.“The local peoples are helped in this respect by this money,” Mr Kiss said.But not everyone is so optimistic about the new scheme.Vanuatu’s opposition leader Ralph Regenvanu has described this latest deal to offer citizenship to stateless people as a “dubious private money-making venture”.Michelle Foster from the Peter McMullin Centre for Statelessness at the University of Melbourne fears the initiative gives states an excuse to continue persecuting minority groups.“We should be heading toward inclusion as a community rather than almost excusing the behaviour of those states and saying ‘ah well, you don’t have to have responsibility for the problem you’ve caused, we can just solve it over here by selling this citizenship’,” she said."
475,https://vbr.vu/news/ban-on-poultry-products-from-victoria/,2020-09-10 03:06:00,Ban on poultry products from Victoria,"By Mavuku TokonaVanuatu has placed a ban on all imported poultry products from Victoria, Australia, due to the Avian Influenza, Acting Principal Veterinary Officer of Biosecurity Dr Roger Philips confirmed this week.The Biosecurity doctor stated that they (Biosecurity) were informed of an outbreak West of Victoria and had to take measures to protect Vanuatu poultry.“We received a formal notification of an outbreak of AVIAN influenza commonly called bird flu.“We have a ban on all poultry products from the state of Victoria, from other states such as New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia it’s fine, we have just put a stop to the import of poultry from Victoria to remove any possible risk of any devastating disease from Vanuatu,” Dr. Philips said.According to Dr. Philips, the ban is a necessary not just for commercial farms in Vanuatu, but to safe-keep the chickens in villages and communities as well – “eradicate the disease would prove very difficult especially with the village, our fowl situation in Vanuatu there are many chickens, a lot of many people keep chickens and it would be a disease that would spread easily and to control it would be an economic disaster”.The Acting Principal Veterinary Officer of Biosecurity emphasized that there isn’t much of a public concern since the Bird Flu is known to only affect birds, nonetheless, Vanuatu still needs to keep the disease out.“It’s primarily a chicken disease, in 2009 with the H1N1 virus, which was infecting people but primarily it’s a disease of chicken and poultry, not really a public health concern but it is destructive to the poultry industry.”As for the situation in Victoria, Dr. Philips reported that the three farms have been placed in quarantine with a 5km radius, “stop vehicles coming in and out of there, being a virus it spreads on peoples’ feet, clothing, vehicle tyres, it means you have to have a containment zone around the farm. I think it spread to three farms from the first farm, it spread to two other farms in Victoria.”Bird Flu has a high mortality rate so infected chickens are unlikely to recover which makes highly concentrated chicken farms an easy target for the influenza to spread – “it’s one of the world’s most leading concern with poultry growers along with another disease called new castle disease”.Before Vanuatu can lift the ban on Victorian poultry, a declaration by the state that they are free from the disease must be made public.“We require certification from the veterinary authority from exporting countries to state that zone, state or country is free of AVIAN influenza and new castle disease, of course they can’t be certain right now from Australia, so no reports are possible.”Currently, Australia has actioned their response plan to contain and eradicate the Avian Flu, until a declaration is made by the state of Victoria the ban stays Dr. Philip said.“Border security officers are aware, until a declaration of freedom from that state of that disease, we have this ban in place.”"

So within 18 years, we have achieved a huge increase in price.“Many farmers through- out Vanuatu have benefited a lot from this commodity that it empowers farmers to continue increase production.“When we have increased markets, this implies that there is increased demand. Consequently, we have good price but if we have limited markets, the price will remain low.“Potential market for Vanuatu kava is huge globally.“In the future if we are not careful, other countries who do not usually grow kava will start planting kava like the Solomon Islands.“We need to ensure that Vanuatu produced kava is branded locally and continues to maintain its top quality.“Ensuring top quality is the responsibility of processors and exporters to make sure all facilities are of high standard.“If we want our market to grow and Vanuatu’s name to become well- known, we need to supply top quality kava.“Branding is very important as competition will be high since other countries have started producing more kava as well. So we need to promote Vanuatu original kava and maintain the quality standard as exporter of top quality kava.“Kava is Vanuatu’s green gold, a commodity whereby local farmers earn a lot of income from.“Farmers are encouraged to target good quality product to maintain market,” he concluded."

Ticket validity extensions will also be provided to affected passengers uncertain about booking their future travel, with tickets automatically being held in credit and valid towards a new airfare for travel until 1 December 2022.“Due to the fact that we don’t see any relaxation of borders for international travel any time soon, we are unfortunately extending the suspension,” said Solomon Airlines CEO Brett Gebers.“We are continuing to work with all Governments and responsible Ministries to ensure compliance with all travel restrictions, and we will only publish an international schedule when travel restrictions are eased and we are allowed to resume normal operations.“In the meantime, we will persevere and we are continuing approved repatriation flights and charters and have conducted extensive reviews of the company’s current finances and potential future operations.“Regular, scheduled international services are vital to our survival, and while there is no clear timeframe currently for borders opening, we continue to explore the viability of first opening access between COVID-19 free Pacific neighbour countries, observing all relevant travel protocols.”Mr Gebers said Solomon Airlines’ Helpful Holidays domestic tourism initiative is also continuing.The airline is working with local industry partners to develop the next phase of holiday offers, to cover travel to the end of the year.

Its mission is to efficiently distribute relief funds to at-risk communities across the globe while increasing financial inclusion.Situated on the infamous Ring of Fire and located within the Cyclone Belt, Vanuatu experiences many geophysical and hydro-meteorological hazards which includes earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, landslides, cyclones, floods and droughts.With this Unblocked Cash Transfer programme, Oxfam in Vanuatu is planning to deploy a large-scale cash transfer response, adopting a consortium style approach that provides e-vouchers as aid assistance in times of disasters.Instead of giving money in forms of cash, Oxfam provides an e-voucher card with a deposit of Vt10,000 that renews every month to affected households. The entitlements are held on the card as a sequence of deposits and withdrawals.In the Oxfam-Sempo system, the data stored on the Near-field Communication (NFC) compatible card could only be modified by an NFC-compatible smartphone, which can scan the card when held nearby (two cards cannot interact).Registered vendors/shop sellers will be provided a free standardised smartphone to aid in the cash transfers of the e-voucher system.The Unblocked Cash Pilot last year has shown modest cost-savings and significant time-savings related to operational activities.The provinces covered by this program are: SANMA (Santo), SHEFA (Efate) and TAFEA (Tanna). It is said an estimated total of 5,000 households will be targeted in this response which will commence in the following months.The response program is implemented in three phases:Phase 1: Preparedness – donor proposals & partner agreements (June – August)Phase 2: Design & Setup – network setup & package preparation (June – September)Phase 3: Implementation – field trainings & pre-identifications (October – March 2021)The beneficiaries in this program who are mostly vulnerable age-groups are: single mothers (with children), widows and widowers (under 60yrs), elderlies (60+), people with disabilities and displaced people (houses destroyed).Main donors for the program are provided by the Australian and New-Zealand Government. Other resourceful partners include: World Vision, Save the Children, Digicel, Vanuatu Society for People with Disability (VSPD), Vanuatu Business Resilience Council, Barrett and Partners, ADRA, Vanuatu Christian Council (VCC), Vanuatu Red Cross, Vanuatu Disability Promotion & Advocacy Association (VDPA), Viewpoint Exploration (ViewpX) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF).The Oxfam Unblocked Cash Transfer call-centre and hotline have been setup and will be activated during the course of the response. In case of problems or feedbacks, one can call beneficiaries on +678 34888 or ask their Community Focal Person."
485,https://vbr.vu/news/total-australian-aid-increased-but-cruel-cuts-outside-the-pacific/,2020-10-07 23:21:00,Total Australian aid increased but cruel cuts outside the Pacific,"By Stephen HowesThe Australian Coalition Government did something very unusual in the aid budget last night. It increased foreign aid. It kept the headline aid figure at $4 billion (as per last year’s forward estimates), but then said it would spend another $211 million this year to respond in the region to COVID-19. This supplementary amount is identified as separate from rather than part of the aid program but it is in the form of grants for development so clearly it is in fact more aid.Including this supplementary amount brings total aid for 2020-21 to $4,211 million, an increase of 4% over last year. It’s not a huge increase, but it is the first budgeted aid increase under the Coalition since their election to office in 2013, and it is well above the rate of inflation.Clearly the government isn’t trying to earn a reputation for generosity. In fact, it seems like the opposite: it is trying to keep the increase in aid hidden. Presumably, the government wants to continue to be seen to be tough on aid – likely to ward off attacks from the likes of Pauline Hanson and others on the right.The other factor driving the odd accounting could be that the government does not want to be seen to be providing a permanent boost to aid. Normally forward estimates are provided for the aid budget, but, strangely, not this time. Presumably though, from its signalling, the government is comfortable with $4 billion as the “right” amount for aid going forward.The challenge for aid advocates will be to keep aid growing in real terms next year and beyond. The challenge for the government will be to sustain the fiction that the supplementary funding is not aid. While countries have the right to select what they include in their aid (Official Development Assistance) when they report to the OECD, it would be absurd and ultimately counter-productive (because of its complete lack of rationale) to dictate that some of DFAT’s aid is not to be counted as such. (This artificial distinction will also likely complicate aid programming within countries.)The above might explain the government’s framing but it doesn’t explain the substance: why did it increase the aid budget after years of cutting it? To understand this, we have to first cover the bad news – the big cuts to aid outside the Pacific.Aid to Southeast Asia (excluding Timor Leste) is unchanged in nominal terms. Aid to South and West Asia is cut by 27%. Aid to sub-Saharan Africa is cut by 48%, and aid to the Middle East and North Africa by 61%. These are massive reductions, but aid to these regions had already been reduced over several years. Therefore, this new round of cuts only generates $180 million of savings. $80 million is needed for various multilateral commitments (such as our new vaccine pledges), and $40 million to bring the aid budget down from $4.04 billion last year to $4 billion this. The net result from all these savage cuts is therefore only $60 million for extra aid to the Pacific and Timor Leste – or just a 4% increase for this priority region.Clearly a 4% increase isn’t enough to respond adequately in our region to the greatest crisis of the post-colonial era. And so, for the first time, it has been admitted that cuts elsewhere can only take you so far, and that actually the Pacific Step-up needs an increase in total aid. With the supplement, aid to the Pacific and Timor Leste increases by $270 million or 18%.It makes no sense to take $28 million from a country like Afghanistan whose people are really suffering and give it to relatively stable and comparatively prosperous countries such as Samoa and Tonga. But, while the share of Australian aid going to the Pacific seems destined to continue to increase, it is something of a victory to at least see the government concede that the Pacific Step-up cannot be executed without an increase in total aid.Notes: The supplemental amounts include $202.4 million (this year; $304.7 million over two years) as a COVID-19 economic response package for the Pacific and Timor Leste and $8.9 million (this year; $23.2 million over three years) for a COVID-19 vaccine and health security program for the Pacific and Southeast Asia. I assume half of the latter amount is for the Pacific.This article appeared first on Devpolicy Blog (devpolicy.org), from the Development Policy Centre at The Australian National University.

Holding violators accountable will set an example to other repatriates.Restriction will be applied to smokers, visitation from families and repatriates’ movements.Apart from limiting visitations, restricting physical movement and kava, alcohol consumption by repatriates, Director Tarivonda said quarantine facilities who are found not to be following regulations will also be dealt with.“They will be removed from the list of approved quarantine facilities,” he added.Approved quarantine facilities are required to provide security with the police to maintain order as well as ensuring no close contact throughout the 14-day period."

One of this is Vanuatu Helicopters.The helicopters of this company have been used numerous times to medivac people requiring immediate medical attention but the moment the helicopters have been grounded as they require scheduled maintenance and Vanuatu does not currently have any aircraft engineers who are qualified to do helicopter maintenance.Ground and Flight Operations Manager of Vanuatu Helicopters, Andy Martin says due to the closed borders they have not been able to bring in engineers to run maintenance on their helicopters.The helicopter pilot says the grounding of the aircrafts have caused a hindrance on providing essential services such as medivac flights and he mentioned the fisherman who went missing on the east coast of Erromango.Mr Martin says he was contacted by the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and the Police Maritime Wing to assist in the search, however he cannot help as his fleet has been grounded, needing maintenance which can only be done if engineers are allowed into the country.After several attempts by Mr Martin to arrange for the arrival of the engineers with the COVID-19 task force, Director of Public Health and spokesperson of COVID-19 matters, Len Tarivonda, says the engineers can come in during the upcoming second phase of repatriation and all flights will be done by Air Vanuatu.Dr Tarivonda says the engineers must include in the lists of people scheduled to travel to Vanuatu which are currently being compiled by Vanuatu’s high commissions abroad.They will have to pay for their own flights and possibly their own quarantine costs.He says all repatriation flights in phase 2 will align with Air Vanuatu’s scheduled weekly flights to Auckland and other ports in the region, however Air Vanuatu is yet to provide this to NDMO and the Ministry of Health.Dr Tarivonda also says all inbound travelers and returnees are obliged to undergo the 14-day mandatory quarantine period in designated government approved quarantine facilities and Vanuatu Helicopters would have to pay for the quarantine costs.He mentions NDMO will issue a new regulation order soon to completely remove all previous requirements to disinfect and quarantine inbound cargo at the ports of entry.Vanuatu Helicopters operates a Robbinson R44 Clipper II and a Robbinson R66."

In the same way, we have to be ready to dialogue with Jakarta”, he says.“The Prime Minister assured my Committee that he has not received any invitation from Jakarta but that his Government received a communication from a Jakarta Office in New Zealand in which West Papua was mentioned but that there was no invitation directly from Jakarta”.The Chairman was approached by an individual who claimed that the Chairman’s name was also on the list of persons allegedly invited by Jakarta to visit Indonesia.“Following the allegation, I wish to reiterate that my committee can only work with the Government but not with any innuendo(s) regarding our work on West Papua”, he stresses.He says so much has been delayed due to COVID-19 but that as soon as the current travel restrictions are lifted, he wishes to assure the people of Vanuatu and the Pacific and the world that his Committee will definitely be “moving with the current wherever it is heading”."

We (the school) have exhausted our budget in developing the home school packages,” he said.“It costs a lot for a school like mine with a large enrollment to develop the home packages.”Like other schools throughout the country, Ecole Saint Jeanne D’Arc needs the annual grant from the Ministry of Education and Training (MoET) to keep operating.Principal Johanin said the school has already provided its application for the next grant but the MoET is taking too long to release the funds.“The school’s tuition fee structure has not been approved. Tuition fee is one of the sources of income for the school.“The stimulus package should cover the homes school package costs but primary schools and kindergartens are not entitled to this.”Operated under the Catholic Education Authority (La DEC), Ecole St Jeanne D’Arc also enrolls early childhood learners.Director of La DEC, Simon Bangus, said the school has been facing financial stress since 2017 and COVID-19 crisis has made the situation worse.He assured parents that they are negotiating with the MoET to sort out the issue for classes to resume.Apart from Ecole St Jeanne D’Arc, other schools are also facing similar challenges.For example, Ulei Junior Secondary School in north Efate has issued a notice on July 31 to parents not to send children back to school yet as the school is facing shortage of funds and cannot meet its expenses.Ulei Junior Secondary School stressed that it is still waiting to receive subsidy funds from the economic stimulus package as promised by the government.A decision is yet to be made concerning the school fee structure and whether students will not resume or not resume classes until after two weeks break.Meanwhile in a statement issued yesterday, the MoET said principals and school councils must get approval before closing doors due to reasons relating to finance.“Everyone should be reminded that teaching and children’s learning is always priority compared to school development projects in this current crisis,” the MoET stated.“Principals and school councils must ensure children continue learning.”All principals and school councils are reminded to follow the process and meet the requirements in place in order to access the next grant and all information should be provided through the Open VEMIS.The MoET conveyed that it is also reviewing school fee structures that were submitted this month and has urged school authorities to submit fee structures before August 21, 2020."

In his keynote address, the former diplomat who spent over 10 years in Europe was nostalgic in his memory of his young school days in Port Vila.He said it was indeed a miracle when the country’s original leaders raced against time to design the country’s Flag, write the Constitution, write the National Anthem to replace the British and French national anthems and produce the first Vanuatu Passport.The DG said those who were 40 years and younger, would never know the country’s young heart beat in the last quarter leading to July 30th of 1980.Things were completed at unbelievable speed to meet the dateline for Independence.For this reason, the DG said as a ni-Vanuatu, he said he understood why so many national leaders today did not support the sale of the Green Passport as it is the country’s “identity” and should not be sold for monetary gain.He said the term “statelessness” was in reference to all then New Hebrideans who, in the absence of a genuine passport, were allowed to travel on a black or dark blue covered document which clearly stated on one of the pages words along these lines that the holder of the document did not own it, that it belonged to the British/French Governments and they had a right to take it away from the holder at any time.For this reason, the DG appealed to all young people to read to understand the history of the country to appreciate and respect these important items that qualify Vanuatu as a Sovereign Nation."

With my presence in NBC, I am also a Shareholder in Air Vanuatu, so here I am ready to assist.”The Minister acknowledged the impact of COVI-19 saying the virus is affecting the whole world but added, “…when the border reopens, we will definitely run very fast to overtake some of our close neighbours”.The CEO responded, “We have to create Vanuatu to become the most competitive destination in the Pacific, not only for visitors but also investors that want to invest in Vanuatu’s Tourism Sector.”Mrs Aru praised her committed staff for achieving the vision this year as per the Tourism Publication, “Tourism 2020”.“We have made so many market researches to confirm that we must change ‘Discover What Matters’ and relaunch Vanuatu in the market place.“Unfortunately for our target of one million cruise visitors by 2030, the current impact of COVID-19 now means a major cruise reform in the cruise sector.”It remains to be seen based on advice from Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruises.“I want to bring to your attention Minister our Improved Market Readiness. We want our local operators to be market ready not only for international markets but also for domestic markets.”VTO is already eyeing marketing local products through its Provincial Tourism Operators."

With increasing threat of Intellectual Property Infringements, Managing Director of Fibreglass Vanuatu, Geordie Mackenzie-Reur, made a right decision to ask the guidance of the Intellectual Property office for advice to protect the boat designs which are unique for Vanuatu waters.Production Manager, Jason Mackenzie-Reur, provided the technical specifications of each boat as required in the application process. Application process began in October 2017 and over two years later the 7 metres fibreglass boat was registered in December 2019 and 5.8m boat in June 2020.This is a great achievement for a local manufacturing business in receiving the certificate of registration as it gives the company the exclusive right over their designs of the 7m and 5.8m fibreglass boats.The Vanuatu Intellectual Property Office encourages other local businesses that have created their own designs/products to go to the office to seek more advice on how to protect their different products under the different Intellectual Property laws of Vanuatu as this is the same footsteps the Fiberglass Vanuatu have followed to get their designs registered under the Design Act No.3 of 2003.Timing for this special achievement coincides with Department of Industry initiative for local companies to register “Vanuatu Made Brand” with pride on their products and to celebrate Vanuatu maturity to its 40 years of Independence."

This percentage increases for May and June. As the ESP was designed to support employees to remain in paid employment during the COVID-19 crisis period it is becoming increasingly more difficult for businesses to be able to pay their staff while waiting for the promised support.Secondly, 42% of businesses that have applied for and received March payments of the ESP are small businesses with four staff members and under demonstrating that the business community is largely made up of small businesses. These small businesses often do not have cash reserves to turn to in such tough times.“With the ESP coming to an end in June we are requesting that an extension of a minimum of 3 months is offered to the ESP so that businesses can retain staff while working out what is next for them in this increasingly difficult economic environment,” the VCCI stated.“Concerningly, if the ESP does not get extended over 58% surveyed will be making staff redundant with the ending of the ESP payment in June. On top of this many businesses simply cannot afford to pay out severance and entitlements so will out staff on leave without pay.”The VCCI noted that recently both the Australian and New Zealand governments extended their employee support by an additional three months to September, in recognition of the ongoing hardship faced by SMEs in their own countries, before concluding, “we have shared our findings and recommendations to relevant ministries of the Government and will continue to lobby for extended support”."

However, there are concerns which we would like to stress to the current government and the VNPF board in regards to the student accommodation allowance,” they alleged.They told the Daily Post that the offer letter which was signed by students at the beginning of the semester clearly stated the VNPF scheme will fund the tuition fees, travelling expenses, book allowances and accommodation allowance while the scholarship office will fund the students’ living allowance.“This has brought to our attention that the tuition fees have been fully funded by the VNPF except the accommodation allowance which has not been met even though it was stated in the agreement letter. We know that the scheme is a kind of loan which will be still repay with interest at the end of our studies,” the students said.“Therefore, we appreciate if the current government through the Ministry of Education and Finance together with the VNPF board to reconsider this and to meet our accommodation allowance as mentioned in the agreement letter.”The students said some of them had resigned from their jobs expecting that the scholarship fund will cover their accommodation expenses, before actually signing the agreement letter.“We have managed to complete the first semester successfully through the COV19-fund from VNPF,” the students said.“We are now worrying for the second semester accommodation as there are no houses available at the campus, in particular the married and single quarters. We prefer for the VNPF to reimburse all first semester receipts and meet second semester accommodation in order for us to complete our program successfully. We deserve good student welfare for achieving our goals as far as future human resource of this nation is concern.“We do appreciate the last Opposition bloc who have raised concern about the scheme during the beginning of the year and they are now at the helm of the government of the day, so we do believe they will listen to our concern and make reviews to the policy for the scheme to be effectively benefit our future human resources for the better wellbeing and wealthy nation in years to come.”Daily Post has contacted the Ministry of Finance and in response, the Director General of the Ministry of Finance, Letlet August, who is also chairman of the VNPF Board said the government is aware of the students’ concern.“We are aware of the situations and have been in consultation with the Scholarship Office on how best the situation could be addressed and improved,” Mr Letlet said.“The Fund is working very closely with the Universities to engage in MOUs, in order to accommodate all Fund sponsored students directly into the University’s accommodation. This way, funds are paid directly into the University’s Bank accounts and it is easily manageable.“Further, for any outstanding accommodation, the fund will ensure they are paid. The fund is encouraging sponsored student to contact the Provident Fund on their plan accommodations.“In May this year, both the Fund and Scholarships Office met to restructure the scholarship scheme. This will include aligning the award with the country’s Human Resource Development Plan recently launched by the Government. There was a lot of discussions concerning the students’ welfare.”In an interview with Buzz FM’s Kizzy Kalsakau, VNPF General Manager, Parmod Achary, confirmed that 95 Ni-Vanuatu students at USP’s Emalus campus in Port Vila are under the VNPF-Vanuatu Government education scheme.He said accommodation issues have been noted and that the VNPF and the Ministry of Education (MOE) liaise closely to sort these issues. He advised the students with accommodation issues to refer this to the MOE.“The students must see the MOE to be registered and then for the ministry to liaise with the VNPF on this,” he said.Mr Achary assured the students that the VNPF can support the students’ accommodation expenses but this has to be registered with the MOE so that issues such as rents offered by the landlords must be considered, he said.He said two important components of the scheme offered by VNPF and the Vanuatu Government are the tuition fee and the accommodation.The GM said consideration is given to the students’ accommodation to ensure that they lodge where their studies must not be affected.GM Achary said so far up to VT66 million has been paid to students under the Members Education Support Scheme and assured that that VNPF is ready to assist if the students are accommodated at the Emalus campus in Port Vila."

Working hand in hand with Yumiwork, Port Vila’s first co-working space, V-LAB seeks to provide access to facilities, services and mentoring to young entrepreneurs in Vanuatu with the view to enable them to develop and grow their businesses as well as to promote entrepreneurs in the country.Since its establishment in October 2019, the Association has reached out to young Ni-Vanuatu Regional Seasonal Workers in Australia and New Zealand and at home about the purpose and the objectives of the Association. Many Ni-Vanuatu entrepreneurs and even those not in businesses have come forward wanting to know more about V-LAB.In an interview with the Daily Post, founder of the V-LAB Marc-Antoine Morel, explains that with the support of the government of New Zealand, and fully registered with the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission (VFSC), V-LAB is composed of individuals, both Ni-Vanuatu and expats with considerable expertise in business development, entrepreneurship and innovation in the country and beyond.“V-LAB business development program has three main objectives. First is to accompany young entrepreneurs in the development and growth of their businesses, with an emphasis on businesses which focuses on innovation, green economy and social entrepreneurship, secondly to improve and enhance the financial inclusion and digital transformation of these businesses to the Vanuatu market, in close coordination with our banking and ICT partners and thirdly, to influence and support the development of an environment that is conducive to entrepreneurship in the country, through for instance policy reform and development,” President of the Association, Marc-Antoine Morel, pointed out.“We believe there are young Ni-Vanuatu business entrepreneurs both male and female, out there with innovation of new products for this country,” Marc-Antoine Morel assured.V-LAB has started a survey to collect data and information on the level of interest of Seasonal Workers for entrepreneurship in Vanuatu. The survey is conducted as part of a project implemented by the V-LAB in cooperation with the Australian Government and the Department of Labor of Vanuatu.“It is our hope that the best and most innovative business ideas identified here will be supported through the next phase of this program,” said Morel. The survey is kept confidential and will not be shared with others, he pointed out.Georgia Noy, Labor Mobility Engagement Manager, the Employment Service Unit, and Patrice Kuatonga, Senior Labor Officer Employment Services Unit, both at the Department of Labor, say many Ni-Vanuatu Seasonal Workers in Australia and New Zealand, already have plans as to how they want to invest their earnings once they return to Vanuatu.“Many who have been to Australia and New Zealand a number of times, have already established businesses or build homes and are eying new business undertakings in agriculture and other sectors. Many are successful in their business undertakings in small but successful ways and moving on in life,” they say. Many of these who are either back in Australia or New Zealand are entrepreneurs and they have now contacted V-LAB because they see new innovations in either Australia or New Zealand that have challenged them to have a start-up whether similar or different of their own when they return home,” Kuatonga and Noy revealed.On the question of what type of businesses V-LAB supports, Morel said V-LAB strongly believes in the power of innovation and the value social entrepreneurship.“As such, we wish to support businesses that are creative and or using innovative technologies. As much as possible, we would also like to support business which are respectful of the people and of the environment,” he stressed.He said many young Ni-Vanuatu have approached V-LAB since it was established in October last year and many call in at the office every day of the week. Many make contact using V-LAB website and contacts.The V-LAB is financially supported by the Bred Bank, Vodafone, the Australian Aid and others and partnering with the Employment Services Unit of the Labour Department.The President, Marc-Antoine Morel, is positive that more organization in Vanuatu will lend their support towards the program that is aim to help Ni-Vanuatu business entrepreneurs paving their way successfully into the business world.“Coming together is a beginning, staying together is progress, and working together is success,” is what a group of Expats and Ni-Vanuatu who have come together to support and promote entrepreneurship in Vanuatu.“Together, we bring a great amount of experience, expertise, passion and commitment to accompany young entrepreneurs in the country,” Morel expressed."

The last order made was last year. We received our last container last December (20ft) … this is the reserved stock we’re running on.”According to Mr. Calvo, he makes his orders for alcohol and goods every three months which comes directly from France, an attempt to separate himself from the competitive market in Port Vila.“If we’re talking about goods, we have to have something different to sell. Yes it was a French territory before, so we still have a market of people looking for French products.”However, due to the lockdown, he has second guessed making a next order since he is unaware when exactly it would reach Port Vila – “There are still cargo ships but it may be taking a bit more time.”The business that was borne a decade ago has literally everything on the shelf, and on the line, as it moves towards the eighth month of not re-stocking.The one-time orders that come in from Night Clubs along with the odd local with a palette for French wine are slowly hacking away the reserve supply, although Mr. Calvo remains optimistic that his business is able to last this tourism dry spell."

513,https://vbr.vu/news/emua-boasts-threein-one-development/,2020-08-25 00:37:00,Emua boasts ‘threein- one’ development,"By Len GaraeThe Emua Market is a UN Women Project under its Market for Change Programme which falls under its National Project Coordinator and Secretary General (SG) of SHEFA Province, Morris Kaloran, since 2014.According to the Project Coordinator, Emua Village is targeted by donor partners because of its location with its Emua Cooperative Society which also has a National Bank of Vanuatu Branch located in the same building.“The attraction by development partners to the site on which the cooperative is built is that it has a land title”, says Coordinator Kaloran.“It is for the same reason that the Market House Project is located on the same plot”.He confirms UN Women’s assistance towards the project while Australian Aid remains the majority contributor to the project, while Canada, Vanuatu Government and Shefa Provincial Government also contributed to the project.While the building now looks ready to launch, Kaloran says Public Works will need to certify its completion before the building is officially launched most likely before the end of the year.SG Kaloran speaks highly of Emua Village as a perfect settlement for potential replication throughout the country. Its advantage is that Emua Village Cooperative is built on land that has a land title, which enabled NBV to open its Branch there and now Emua Market is built on the same plot because development partners are keen to fund projects on land that has an existing title.While the village has its “three-in-one” commercial development at the entrance, Kaloran is confident that the Director of the Department of Cooperatives, Ridley Joseph, and NBV Rural Banking would see eye-to-eye with him on the trend of development by building cooperatives and NBV Branches next to the new market houses. “This is the best approach for market vendors to open their bank accounts where they can deposit or withdraw their money on any working day”, he says.Head of Cooperatives Joseph has welcomed the idea and says as long as the land where they build is registered then he would be interested to talk to the Coordinator.SG Kaloran says his Administration is in the process of connecting water, electricity and Solar Panel to the Market House to reduce costs, while the Market is going to be managed by the Mamas. We apologise and retract an earlier article which announced a premature opening of the project. The information was supplied to the writer by the women who were excited about their new Market House."
514,https://vbr.vu/news/wacc-calls-for-private-schools-to-be-investigated/,2020-08-25 03:36:00,WACC calls for private schools to be investigated,"By Len GaraeAll private schools should operate in line with a national standard of education approved by the Ministry of Education which is implemented by highly qualified teachers, to provide a high level of quality education for which parents pay so much money, to benefit their children.Inspectors employed by the Department of Education must inspect private schools to ensure that all teachers are qualified and registered and all those who are called “teachers” while by trade are either retired bankers or from other non-teaching professions, must be removed as they are not delivering the education expected from parents.WACC Chairperson Jenny Ligo made the above statement following a four-page letter she and one of the concerned mothers whose child is attending a private Pikinini Playtime, wrote questioning the Director of Education about the running of private schools.Ligo was impressed by the confidence of the Director of Education who moved quickly to facilitate a meeting to hear their concerns concerning private schools.Asked to describe the atmosphere of the meeting, she replies, “The Director was prompt and postponed some of his duties in order to listen to our concerns, and I am confident that he will look into our concerns”.Their letter listed the role of private schools, importance of qualified teachers, rights of a child to education, Ministry of Education Inspectors. Official salaries and the need for a strong Parents Association.Without naming any private school as a culprit, she says she is concerned that some private schools demand high school fees while some of their teachers may not be qualified to teach. “Then they organise fundraising activities instead of teaching the children, wasting valuable school hours”, she says.“What we need is for school inspectors to visit all private schools to make sure all teachers are qualified to teach, school buildings and all other facilities in the environment qualify the school to be called a private school”."
515,https://vbr.vu/news/weathering-the-covid-19-storm/,2020-08-25 03:06:00,Weathering the COVID-19 Storm,"By Mavuku TokonaSince the global pandemic began, the domino effect it has had on the tourism market remains unprecedented, the temporary home-away-from-home industry has taken a huge financial hit, some worse than others.The few that have managed to weather the unrelenting storm of the global pandemic are surviving on a limited supply of guests, not knowing when the next batch will check-in into isolation.Iririki Island Resort currently accommodates 106 repatriated travellers from overseas and since the return flights began, Director and owner of the island Resort Darren Pettiona said that around 300 repatriates have already checked-in and out of the island.“There is 106 at the moment, they will be flying probably two flights per week for the next few months and try and bring back all the stranded citizens from mainly Australia, New Zealand and Fiji,” he said.With borders closed and the lifeline for a tourism run country placed on hold, Iririki remarkably held on to its 200 staff since March and only temporarily released 75 workers last Monday.“We don’t want to make anyone redundant because we will need them back, and we want to make sure they got their jobs and protect their severance and annual leave, we kept 200 staff employed since last Monday and we stood down 75 staff because we don’t have the work volume for them. So we will keep bringing them back as the demand increases.”Mr. Pettiona said before focusing tourists, all the repatriated flights need to be completed, since the two cannot coexist.“You cannot do repatriation and tourism at the same time; the only way tourism works is if people don’t go into quarantine. No one is going to come three-week holiday and spend two- weeks in quarantine. The first chance for the government is to get repatriation cleared.”Even with the Tamtam bubble in September, the once silver lining is looking duller than ever with the new outbreaks in Australia and New Zealand.Even though the Vanuatu tourism industry is in a state of hibernation, it could awake to an array of opportunities that are ripe for the taking.Mr. Pettiona explained that Vanuatu being COVID-19 free could be the best marketing strategy the country has ever had, aside from the conventional methods, “we don’t get a lot of brand coverage from travel agents promoting Vanuatu so Vanuatu has to rely on direct marketing and word of mouth from people who have been here before.”Mr. Pettiona added that the steadfast actions of the Vanuatu government and proper due diligence of health workers is creating an enticing tourism destination, free from COVID-19 and able to manage and contain the virus, if need be.“We (Vanuatu) have the testing facilities to test here, we have the ICU unit to isolate people should we require so we are prepared and that’s very important too because we have to be able to demonstrate to Australia and New Zealand that we have the ability to deal with this if something happens cause if we can’t demonstrate that, they’re going be very reluctant to send us any tourists.”The owner of the island Resort that currently has it fourth lot of repatriates said this demonstration of independence is key to receiving tourists again in the near future, something Vanuatu continues to portray in consistent fashion."

That is why we need to engage private sector and associations to assist us in carrying out some of our activities.“The DARD has set up such arrangement in the past with farmers, individuals who need financial assistance and RSE workers who usually work at the farm before departure.“Working at the farm is a great experience for young people.“I acknowledge all the work you have done at the farm,” Director Ravo concluded.The chairperson of Tanombere Association, Lloyd Fikiasi, said “We are in a situation where most families are apart but through our family connection and such engagement with DARD, we can support our families given the difficult situations they are currently facing.“I acknowledge the negotiation, commitment and assistance provided by the Department of Agriculture.“The association is more than happy to get involve in the programs that aims to put progress to the development of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries and Biosecurity.”"

519,https://vbr.vu/news/chiko-farm-owner-challenges-visa-cancellation/,2020-08-25 03:01:00,CHIKO FARM OWNER CHALLENGES VISA CANCELLATION,"By Charles HakwaChiko Farm owner, Kenneth Thode, is challenging the Department of Immigration’s decision to cancel his visa.Mr Thode has cited several reasons which he claims is all due to an incident which took place 18 months ago and an allegation of him threatening staff and neighbours with a rifle.In a telephone interview with Buzz 96.3 FM, Thode says he does not threaten people.He says he even asked the police commander to go and investigate the alleged rifle incident but until today the investigation has not taken place.He says another reason could be that after cyclone Harold the Food Cluster called him and asked for 9,000 dozens of eggs to be sent to affected islands which he supplied.He was later asked to join the Food Cluster, due to COVID-19 rules where the number of people at these meetings was limited so he represented the poultry industry in Vanuatu.Mr Thode says at these meetings he met with DG Roy Micky Joy, Director Jimmy Rantes and others involved in food cluster management.There was a second and third push of eggs to the affected islands which he did as his main concern was protein for Vanuatu. He then realised he needed to replace and restock his chickens.Things went downhill as the first plane out of New Zealand with his replacement was stopped due to COVID-19. He had to replace 25,000 birds to meet this year’s demand.Mr Thode says the problem won’t be visible now, however it will be in November and December as all farmers will not replace their layer chickens so there will be a shortage of eggs.With this happening a charter flight with air Vanuatu needed to be organized to fly to New Zealand to pick up the birds which he ordered from people in New Zealand.He says it takes 23 days to hatch them and the plane is meant to arrive the day they hatch. He says everything was going well and he did all necessary calculations for over 20,000 chicks.He went to Air Vanuatu and calculated the weight and balance for loading them into the front cargo hold of the Boeing 737-800 as live animals are only allowed in the front cargo hold according to the regulations.The flight arrived in New Zealand but he received a call at 2.30 to be told the birds were offloaded, and until today he has not been given any reason as to why this happened. The charter flight he and others organized cost just under VT8 million. He organized the flight and gave people who wanted to send cargo to New Zealand or receive cargo from New Zealand an opportunity to make use of this flight. The government ended up paying for the flight and invoiced him and others who used the flight for cargo.Mr Thode claims Air Vanuatu owes New Zealand authorities VT13 Million in fuel debt and landing fees; he says he was led to believe the government paid for this however he says it is not his fault Air Vanuatu owed money in New Zealand which the government had to pay for.Mr Thode says he lost 8,106 live chicks and the Department of Livestock lost 2,500 live chicks. He says the chicks were all destroyed and he lost a lot of money.In regards to his visa, he applied a week later but was rejected. Mr Thode says all was fine until a week later he ended up in court for a case that has already been decided upon by the court, which he won. The case was over the fact that Chiko was registered twice on the same day in December 2011.He was later summoned to the Department of Labour to explain the issue of the rifle. He told them what had happened and his employees were there with him.In his explanation he says he built a VT15 million brooder building to breed his chickens to lay eggs, since the birds from New Zealand never arrived, he says he had to terminate the staff, it was a job for six men and he laid them off. He had two trucks on the road doing deliveries now he only has one since he had to lay off two more men.Mr Thode says COVID-19 put a huge strain on all businesses and he had to reduce employment. He explained this to his staff who went to the Department of Labour on a Thursday morning to lodge a complaint. Five labour staff visited him that afternoon at 2.30pm to discuss the matter which went well, however the following day at 2.30pm, four Immigration staff visited his office and spoke to him for 20 minutes. All went well; however, they left a letter on his desk which he opened after they left.Mr Thode says he was devastated when he opened the letter and read it. He says it said he threatened the neighbors which he says is a lie as he says he gets on very well with his neighbors who act like security for his property. He says he gives them paid jobs from time to time.Mr Thode says the people who he and his neighbors have issues with are the marijuana smokers who he says live in in area. He says there are so many of them which he claims are the ones who have broken into his farm so many times. He even claims some of them have threatened him saying they would burn down the farm, he says his only response to those verbal threats is that he would shoot them should they burn his farm down.Thode says he never pointed a gun at anyone, however he found out from a staff member of his that another staff member of his and his brother who both lived on site were growing marijuana on the farm and killing the chickens and selling them to make money on the side. The staff member who reported this showed him the marijuana and the dead chicken’s blood. This got him angry and he went to his gun locker and took out his unloaded rifle.He rounded up all his staff and gave the suspect the unloaded gun and told him to either tell the truth or to shoot Thode if he wanted to grow marijuana or kill the chickens. The suspect ended up admitting that he grew the marijuana and killed the chickens. The rifle was not loaded.Mr Thode who owned his first riffle since he was six years old says he respects weapons for what they are and how one uses them. He then loaded a cartridge into the rifle gave it to the suspect made him point into the air and made him fire it to feel how powerful the weapon really is.This was an incident which happened 18 months ago but Mr Thode is surprised the authorities still want to bring this up and hold it against him. Despite all this he says Chiko is here to stay as there is a bigger picture to see.Thode says he came to this nation as a multi-millionaire and he loves Vanuatu or else he would not have stayed for 11 years. He says he has invested over Vt1 billion and in the last twelve months he has invested Vt100 million. He is building a biogas plant at Chiko.Mr Thode says Vanuatu has a lot of fruits and vegetables however protein is also a need he will continue to grow the poultry industry.After cyclone Pam, Thode says no one expected Chiko to come back from the disaster except him and he brought it back, he also says Chiko will bounce back from what they are going through now. He spent Vt50 million on a new brooder house and has had no mortalities since January.He says the byproduct of the biogas plant will be used as fertilizer. He says amidst the COVID-19 pandemic Vanuatu must move forward and needs to produce its own food for both humans and animals.The investor says the country needs its own processing plants which he has already started but the engineers cannot come here to complete it. Nevertheless, he says he will complete it by himself as he has a background in oil and gas before venturing into farming. He says the offshoot will help the other islands as it will enable people to produce electricity from toilet waste.Thode is financing this all on his own, however he says he knows that there may be someone or some people who do not want him doing this. Since he has been here over ten years his wife has become a citizen however despite filling out the forms and paying the fees, he had his application rejected a week after applying and paying.Thode believes that this is political. However, he says he did not come to Vanuatu to lose and will keep on fighting. He says unfortunately people forget the good things he has done for this nation and only chose to remember that one bad incident.He admits he may have been a bit extreme with the rifle however he says marijuana being planted on his property is not something that can be tolerated.Thode says his lawyers are working on his case.Meanwhile Director of Immigration, Jeffery Markson, says the department cancelled Thode’s visa because he threatened his staff with a rifle.He says Thode is now an illegal immigrant, however he has not been listed as one yet as he can still appeal to the Minster of Internal Affairs.Director Markson says should the Minister uphold the Immigration department’s rejection of his residency visa, Thode will be formally listed as an illegal immigrant.He says Mr Thode should be meeting with the Minster this week. Director Markson says Vanuatu is an independent nation with its own laws which everyone should respect. He encourages all investors to respect these laws."

521,https://vbr.vu/news/from-tourism-to-agriculture/,2020-08-18 23:39:00,From Tourism To Agriculture,"By Charles Hakwa & Kizzy KalsakauEvergreen Resort owner Merian Numake has decided to venture into agriculture.Evergreen Resort on the West Coast of Tanna is a well-known place to locals and visitors and has been in existence for over 20 years.Mrs. Numake, however has decided to now venture into agriculture while still running her resort. She says these days it is important to diversify tourism and agriculture.Mrs Numake says she was interested in doing this for a while but never really did anything about it. She says the present COVID-19 pandemic is what actually pushed her into actioning her plans and interest. Mrs Numake says agriculture has to always support tourism.Mrs Numake says with all hotels closed as tourism is currently on hold, she is focusing on supplying food for domestic consumption in Port Vila and around Vanuatu as it will be a long wait before any tourism activity kicks off again.The Resort owner says they have 1000 hectares of customary land which they are planning to use for farming. She says at the moment, she is using only five hectors to grow potatoes.Mrs Numake says the Director of Agriculture is keen in supporting her and other farmers in Vanuatu and she really appreciates the government for its support towards the agriculture sector, especially the plan to inject Vt3 billion. Mrs Numake says she is taking advantage of this incentive.She says like any business venture, everyone has to start somewhere, which is why she is starting off with potatoes before she ventures into other vegetables. She says if tourism kicks off again, she may need to employ more staff to just look after the farm as everyone will be back to working at the resort.In terms of marketing, Mrs Numake says the domestic market is her main focus, however exporting to overseas markets could be a possibility in the near future.Her farm does not have a name yet as she has just started. She says she is part of the Tanna farmers association and her farm is located next to the Evergreen Resort. She says the farm is inland from the resort, however she is only farming the bottom part of the plateau.Mrs Numake says she is looking at also building a fish pond on the farm so the discharge from that pond could be used as fertilizer for her potatoes and other vegetables. She also wants to have a green house on location so she can grow vegetables all year around instead of relying on their natural seasons. She says this would really cut down on relying on imports. She uses tomatoes as an example.Mrs Numake says her vegetables are purely organic from the volcanic rich soil of Tanna. She says the size of vegetables on Tanna proves the richness of the island’s soil.Looking ahead Mrs Numake says, if she can build a resort from scratch and turn it into a 4-star resort in 20 years, she believes she can do the same with farming. She says people should not just think of tourism alone but think wider and diversify tourism and agriculture.Mrs Numake also encourages other women not to see agriculture just as something to sustain the home but to make it a commercial entity and contribute to the national economy."

Being a guarantor means that if ICL fails to meet the loan, VNPF will cover it.According to the GM Achary, the loan guarantee expires next month.“If ICL does not provide any alternative by then, the bank will use our term deposit to clear its debt, which means that member’s funds will be lost.“If this happen, it will definitely be a dent in VNPF’s operation since it’s a substantial amount. We are not ready to face such a loss in this small economy. We cannot lose any money in this one,” he said.VNPF had no choice but to get the security done for what it has allowed as guarantee for ICL with ANZ, said GM Achary.“Currently, there is no security for us since the loan agreement was between ICL and ANZ. VNPF is just the guarantor. Members should understand that part of restructuring the loan arrangement is to protect member’s funds.“Under the new arrangement, we will be giving a direct loan at an amount of USD $7.9m to ICL which will clear ANZ. A loan agreement which will be developed will outline the terms and conditions of the loan.“It will ensure VNPF have a direct access to funds from ICL and is paid monthly. Also, we will be taking more interest in the management of ICL and will have mortgage on shares of shareholders, except VNPF.”GM Achary assured that he is dealing with the company directly to ensure that it starts paying dividend.“In my first statement as the GM, I have assured members that their funds will always be protected under my leadership. This is what I am trying to do now, to recover the funds which were being given out as guarantee.”VNPF is the largest shareholder in ICL."

Ingredients contain Volcanic Pumice, Coconut Husks, and Compost.40-year-old Telkap was one of the very first Ni-Vans to go on the RSE Scheme in New Zealand and he completed 11 seasons altogether. During his time there he worked on nursery farms in South Island of New Zealand where he learnt much about compost and nursery farming.After completing the first season, he returned, built a home for his family on Ambrym and the second time he bought a land in Port Vila and build the second home for his family, purchased and provided public bus transport in the capital.Mr Telkap then saved up and decided on investing his money on a business which not many Ni-Vans operate in the country.With the knowledge gained in New Zealand from compost and nursery, Rickson Telkap, decided to start a compost business and so three months ago, in May as the country approached 40th anniversary celebrations, he decided that it is time to look down on the land but in a different way, and that is to give the land ingredients.“Before I launch the business, I did some research and learnt that the local farmers and even families and individuals are somewhat a bit scared about using imported fertilizer which they feel could spoil the land instead of enriching the land for the crops and plants,” he said.“So, I came up with the ingredients which are fully accepted by both the locals and expatriates alike.”Over the last eight weeks, Rickson produced many liters of compost-fertilizer. His 10-liter packages are selling at Vt1,000.“It is easier for people who do not have their own vehicles to carry a 10-liter package just like a 10-kilo rice in a bus,” says Telkap.As for the actual application of the compost-fertilizer, Telkap says, “you will get the instructions from where you buy the compost-fertilizer”.He produced 20 bags of 10-liter compost-fertilizer a day and has a large supply now in stock."

Instead Oxfam is partnering with a number of local counterparts including the Vanuatu Business Resilience Council (VBRC).VBRC, a sub-committee of the Vanuatu Chamber of Commerce and Industry. VBRC has been selected to provide support in identifying and training suppliers and vendors, formal and informal, who will be providing the goods and services to selected households in Santo, Tanna and Efate.The project will be generating much needed business for the small shops, suppliers and transport operators in affected areas. VBRC is proud to be partnering with Oxfam on such an exciting project and will be travelling into the field in the coming weeks to begin their vendor surveying.Vanuatu ProudThis initiative follows on from Oxfam’s successful piloting of an Unblocked Cash project, undertaken in Pango, Port Vila in 2019.The successful pilot followed the first multi-purpose grant programme ever implemented in the Pacific in 2018-2019, when Oxfam used the provided assistance to the families displaced by the eruption of the Ambae volcano, forcing the relocation of thousands of people to safer locations.This month, the Unblocked Cash Project won the EU Horizon 2020 award for block chain technology use in the aid sector, demonstrating Vanuatu’s contribution to global innovation has made a major impact.Oxfam and the Vanuatu Business Resilience Council look forward to the rollout of this important humanitarian response initiative in September 2020.For more information about the project/program please contact Lisa Faerua, Oxfam Country Director, at +678 25786.

Since its establishment in Vanuatu, CTP has proven to be an effective form of humanitarian assistance, especially in a country where more than half of the population live in remote areas where inaccessibility of roads cause delay in relief assistance during disasters.Most recently, Oxfam sought to address some of the challenges and risks of delivering cash in the multi-island environment of Vanuatu through the piloting of the UnBlocked Cash Project, a blockchain-powered, fully automated e-voucher system that increases the speed of delivery, reduces cost, and makes all purchases fully traceable across a network of local vendors.This innovative work in Vanuatu has now been recognized globally, having been awarded 1 million euros from the European Commission’s Horizon2020 prize, destined for solutions to social innovations challenges using distributed ledger technology. The timing of the prize is especially notable — this is the same system that will be used to deliver cash assistance to people across Sanma, Shefa and Tafea provinces who have been affected by COVID 19. Oxfam is enhancing the e-voucher system and preparing to deliver through a consortium of private sector, civil society and NGOs in Vanuatu. This will be the first time this technology is used at scale in the Pacific region, and the first time globally that it is used by a consortium of partners across multiple islands, concurrently.The UnBlocked Cash Project focuses on generating positive social change among some of the most vulnerable and remote communities in the world, starting with the Pacific. This is achieved through the pioneering of a decentralized model to address the global challenge of delivering international aid to disaster-affected women and men in ways that are more efficient, transparent and sustainable, utilising Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).In 2019, Oxfam applied for the international EIC Horizon Prize on Blockchains for Social Good which 178 organisations from around the world submitted their applications for.The goal of the EIC Prize on Blockchains for Social Good was to recognise and support the efforts made by developers and civil society in exploring the decentralised applications of blockchains for social innovation.The Prize proposed to cover areas such as traceability and fair trade, financial inclusion, decentralised circular economy, transparency of public processes, participation in democratic decision-making, and management of public records.Oxfam’s application contributes to the Prize’s objective to develop scalable, efficient and high-impact decentralized solutions to social innovation challenges leveraging DLT. This innovation places disaster affected people and their communities at the center of decision making related to their cash-based entitlements and addresses the global challenge of linking institutions and individuals directly to those they want to support in ways that do not compromise transparency and accountability.UnBlocked Cash a collaboration between Oxfam- a global leader in delivering humanitarian assistance and Sempo – a mission-driven Fintech start-up working at the intersection between humanitarian aid, technology and financial services. Together, Oxfam and Sempo have demonstrated the first successful trial demonstrating community co-development of a blockchain solution to deliver localised, cash-based disaster assistance in the Pacific region.As partners, both recognize that local communities are always first responders – yet are rarely the main responders to the increasing challenges of natural, climate-related, and manmade crises. Solutions must therefore be built from the bottom up with engagement from local communities who know their needs best.The UnBlocked Cash project builds upon the global commitment to deliver more humanitarian and development programs in the form of cash, voucher, and market-based approaches. The project offers an opportunity to improve the efficiency of how aid is delivered without compromising transparency and sustainability and by integrating digital financial inclusion and utilization of decentralized networks for a more collaborative economy at the community level.Based on its massive success in the country, regional Oxfam offices have also requested the program to be established in the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, and as far abroad as Venezuela. The ni-Vanuatu team based in Port Vila are now providing online technical support and training to these offices to help kick-start cash transfer programming in the two countries. In the environment of COVID-19, UnBlocked Cash is groundbreaking – as it can be delivered remotely, making it timely and efficient in a world where many borders are closed.In November/December 2019, a Jury of 30 high level experts in blockchain technologies, innovation and social sciences made a preselection of the 178 received applications, according to the selection criteria defined in the Rules of Contest. Amongst the finalists selected, Oxfam in Vanuatu’s Country Director Mrs. Elizabeth Faerua and Sandra Uwantege Hart who is the Pacific Cash and Livelihoods Transfer Programs Lead were invited to pitch the project in Brussels at the EU headquarters on 10 February 2020.The Prize sought to award a total of 5 million euros to the innovators that come up with the most promising Blockchain solutions in 6 different social innovation areas; Oxfam was awarded under the area of Aid & Philanthropy, and recognized for pioneering a decentralized model to efficiently and sustainably deliver international aid to disaster-affected women and men.

Ensuring food and nutrition security becomes more essential than ever.Vanuatu is one of the most natural disaster-prone countries and about 70% of Vanuatu’s population lives in rural areas where subsistence farming, fishing and production of cash crops are the main sources of livelihood. With the new EU support, Civil Society Organisation will promote sustainable production of safe and nutritious foods for vulnerable communities. Their action will complement the Ministry of Agriculture’s Overarching Productive Sector Policy, which is supported by the EU Vanuatu Value Chain (VaVaC) Budget Support programme of EUR 25 million (Vatu 3.2 billion).While signing the new agreement at the EU Residence in Suva, the EU Ambassador to Vanuatu and the Pacific, Sujiro Seam said: ‘‘At a time when Vanuatu has to face the double burden of recovering from cyclone Harold and dealing with the COVID-19 crisis, “Team Europe” is stepping up its support to Civil Society Organisations and its technical cooperation.“This support is aligned on Vanuatu’s priorities, set out in the National Sustainable Development Plan.“It complements the EU budget support for the development of agricultural value chains, which aims at strengthening food and nutrition security and rural livelihood. It contributes to the implementation of the European Green Deal, which remains a top priority for the EU and includes the development of smart food systems.”In his brief remarks at the signing Ceremony, the Vanuatu High Commissioner in Suva, Nikenike Vurobaravu acknowledged the continued valuable support of the EU, at a time when Vanuatu is going through challenging times. Tropical Cyclone Harold has changed the basic food and nutrition security landscape, especially in islands that are directly affected by the Category 5 cyclone.It is no doubt that the EU support will strengthen the capacities of Civil Societies organisation to promote the sustainable and climate-smart production of safe and nutritious foods in isolated areas as well as strengthening government’s capacity to oversee and coordinate EU development Cooperation in Vanuatu.Lastly, the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu continues to appreciate its 36 years of healthy relations with EU, a relation based on the legacy of shared history, common values, economic and trade relations."

The rural sector has produced a lot of good organic products, however the challenge of accessing markets remains with one major issue, the standards issue.Guest speakers embarked on the challenges faced in the past with discussions heated up as participants discussed relevant solutions in paving the way forward.Mr Dion Palu, a certified expert based in Vanuatu, relayed how business owners and private sectors can meet specific market standards in domestic and international markets.Mr Rantes said that the meeting has ensured for the DOI to address the bridge between the rural agricultural sector and trades.He further confirmed that the government is setting up few mechanisms such as a platform for dialogue between the producers within the rural and the urban areas.Whether you’re a member of the Primary Producers Authority or a commercial farmer, Mr Rantes stated that the mechanism is to ensure that they register local producers and farmers.“Few resolutions were proposed as well during the meeting in allowing the government to set up mechanisms.

In reality, we aren’t being sent, but our names will be transported in a micro capsule by a rover to the Martian surface”.According to the NASA Exploration Program, the NASA’s Mars 2020 Perseverance rover mission is on its way to the Red Planet to search for signs of ancient life and collect samples to send back to Earth, it will land at Jezero Crater on February 18th, 2021 – around seven months.School Principal Angelique Haudiquer said the school has had the privilege to participate in this event with more than 600 students and staff members, all with a boarding pass granting access onto the ATLAS space shuttle.The main reason for this excursion is quite similar to that of the previous rover sent, Curiosity, to answer the question on all scientists’ minds: are we alone in the universe? As the latter was unable to fully exploit its potential due to terrain challenges and other technical obstacles, another mission was required.This time around, NASA had the brilliant ideas of making this mission a global event.Thanks to this event the names of more than 10 million people were sent from Earth to Mars, Vanuatu included! The launch was a great success, the participants are now able to follow the expedition of the rover."

He also called for greater working partnership between CSOs and NGOs and the Government of Vanuatu.The call for improved coordination is reinforced by the Council of Ministers (COM) Decision 037/2020 which mandated lines ministries and sectors to ensure recovery programs for TC Harold and COVID-19 are aligned to a National Recovery Strategy.The NGOs Technical Development Cooperation Partnership meeting also outlined ways in which NGOs and CSOs can input into recovery planning processes, that is through clusters by way of input into the Sector Report Templates, and input into the draft of the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) and the National Recovery Strategy. NGOs and CSOs are also encouraged to participate in national and provincial recovery coordination meetings.The Vanuatu Civil Society Organizations Support and Technical Cooperation Facility (CSOTCF)On 12 June 2020, the financial agreement for the EU funding facility was signed by Vanuatu National Authorizing Officer (NAO) and the Ambassador and Head of the European Union Delegation for the Pacific.The CSOTCF project is financed from the 11{sup}th{/sup}European Development Fund (EDF) through the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement. The total estimate cost of the facility is EUR 340 million, and is to be implemented over a five year period.The specific objectives of CSOTCF project are to:1) Strengthen capacities of local civil society organizations to contribute to the attainment of Vanuatu’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2, 5, 6 and 13;2) Facilitate the effective and efficient implementation of the 11th EDF National Indicative Programme in Vanuatu.The signed Financing Agreement supports three (3) main priority areas;Output 1:Institutional Capacity Building of Civil Society OrganizationsA strong institutional capacity building focus, facilitate skills transfers (Small CSOs are encouraged to work in partnership with larger CSOs in delivering community-based services)Output 2: Measures to strengthen food security and the economic empowerment of womenStrengthen the capacities of CSOs to promote the sustainable and climate-smart production of safe and nutritious foods in isolated rural areas (which are not effectively covered by MALBFF extension workers), economic empowerment of women, the effects of climate change, natural disasters and other livelihood stresses.Output 3: Measures to strengthen the government’s capacity to oversee and coordinate EU development cooperation in VanuatuStrengthen the coordination of development stakeholders, in line with the new Aid Management Policy and the overall National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP)The CSTOCF funding will be made available later this year for all registered CSOs to apply for. The EU Delegation, in close consultation with the NAO office team, will launch a call for proposals targeting CSOs registered in Vanuatu.The CSTOCF facility will be manage and coordinated by the ACNU through the Vanuatu National Authorizing Office (NAO)."

Many of our customers have adjusted to working from home, bringing new ways of working and challenges to their daily lives.However, it is also an opportunity for new methods of teaching, learning, and developmental opportunities for our future leaders”."

However Dr Tarivonda says this is not possible under Vanuatu’s current COVID-19 protocols.Dr Tarivonda however says Air Vanuatu is permitted to do cargo flights any time to any destination.Ni-Vanuatu in Australia will be repatriated on a Nauru Airlines Boeing 737-300 aircraft while those in New Zealand will be flown home on a Royal New Zealand Air Force C130 Hercules aircraft."

The ICL cable connects the country to the Internet.Wholesale bandwidth capacity is sold to national telecommunications companies and to government agencies.Mr Achary added “the ICL board has agreed to make the loan restructure offer to ICL and we look forward to working with them to conclude the terms of this arrangement.“We also look forward to working with all ICL shareholders to ensure this vital telecommunications infrastructure best serves VNPF members as well as the national interest”."

We are in discussion with the Civil Aviation Authority of Vanuatu and other stakeholders to facilitate these processes, in consultation with the management. We want to ensure that Air Vanuatu is self-sufficient in the long-run.”Mr. Firi also revealed that the Board is re-evaluating the airline’s fleet strategy, placing on hold plans to take delivery of new Airbus A220 aircraft later this year, taking into consideration the COVID-19 economic crisis and the closure of international borders.Given the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, Air Vanuatu will move forward with earlier plans to restructure its workforce, starting June 2020.“The airline will identify those employees who are Essential Full-Time Staff, Essential Part-Time Staff, and those employees who will be placed on Leave Without Pay with the Government employment stimulus package. The changes will be rolled out in separate meetings with all employee groups over the course of the coming few days,” says Wilma Vocor, General Manager Human Resources.Firi continued, “I am heartened by our government’s commitment to provide the financial support that will ensure Air Vanuatu can emerge from the current crisis. The board I lead today will continue to work closely with the management and staff, especially in these unprecedented times. We will get through this together, in the spirit of Vanuatu.”Earlier in the meeting, Chief Executive Officer Derek Nice announced that he has decided not to renew his contract when it expires on June 25.In his message to the employees, Mr. Nice stressed the pride he felt in having led the Air Vanuatu team through a period of tremendous change and accomplishment. “It has been an honor to work with such a strong group of passionate and committed airline professionals,” he said. “Together we returned the airline to profitability, implemented robust succession plans, grew our share of the South Pacific tourism market, and mapped a route to growth and continued future success.“I’ve made this decision in the best interests of the company, giving the new Board of Directors the freedom to implement the new directives mandated by the shareholders in the Vanuatu Government to make the changes they believe are needed to ensure our recovery.”Mr. Nice’s departure marks the return of former CEO Mr. Joseph Laloyer, who will take over as Acting CEO while the board finalizes the recruitment of a new Chief Executive Officer.Laloyer previously worked with the airline for over 30 years, last serving as CEO in 2018."

The total payout to members was Vt1.5 billion.VNPF Board initially approved Vt1 billion for the loan applications but a further Vt500million was requested to meet demands from members.Members who want to continue borrowing under the COVID-19 hardship loan will be charged at an interest rate of 9% as a normal loan, said the General Manager (GM) of VNPF, Parmod Achary.He said funds for the TC Harold loans will be taken from their Medical and Investment Funds which needs to be approved by VNPF Board.“It will be interest-free but at some point we have to decide. It’s members’ money -they can borrow but have to repay with an interest.“At the moment, we expect our budget to be Vt500 million. We expect it will not be enough but at least it will give us a guide.“We encourage members to build permanent decent houses with the funds. We want to give loans for a purpose, not just for the sake of borrowing.Requirements of the loan include evidence of the damage such as reports or photographs of damaged homes or farms. It’s a hardship loan so members have to prove that they are facing hardship,” he said.Following the recent release of this huge amount of payment from VNPF towards the interest-free loan scheme, the VNPF GM Achary has assured that the financial status of VNPF is very stable.“There is surplus in the reserve account.“The funds for the hardship loan came from the normal operating accounts, which earns less than 1% interest on the term deposit,” he said.GM Achary said VNPF staff will be visiting areas affected by cyclone Harold and will serve members there."

He said they will try to apply as well restrictions in place to ensure that the management is organized, conducive to the environment, and try to set an impression to the changes the market management is doing now at the Manples market premises.Furthermore, as the country is about to celebrate its 40th Anniversary this year, the SPGC is also determined to create a better impression within the market, to ensure any foreigners travelling in, may have a good impression as well.This includes ensuring it is well organized, with special measures in place to manage the market properly.The SG said there are a few contributing factors that have come up in regards to the market’s current location. He mentioned issues such as that the market venue is located in a residential zone, and traffic congestions within the area which is quite an issue in the past.Though the public has their perception on what SPGC is doing, the SG further stated that they are acting on the basis that Vanuatu is now mature, adding that as the 40th Anniversary coming up, they want to create a better impression in that market.With people questioning why the number of market vendors have been reduced, the SG mentioned there were a few concerns to the particular committee managing the market premises. He confirmed that the management committee and SPGC are the two parties addressing the current situation. He said SPGC is the only authority to give out a license and permit to any business operation under its jurisdiction. SPGC is aware of the committee’s registration within the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission, however complications were encountered resulting in the current situation.The parties have met yesterday morning, and the committee has begun its operation with an additional of 37 more market vendors to continue their sales at the Manples market premises, a total of 57 overall. However only 20 vendors were present yesterday.He confirmed that it is likely the number will increase but with certain measures in place, to ensure that the sanitation and hygienic standard has to upgrade and more importantly comply with the COVID-19 restrictions.The SPGC is currently working closely with the Manples market management committee in addressing the Manples market’s relocation plan.The SG stated that as far as SPGC is concerned, the Physical Planning Act has given SPGC the authority to ensure that everyone has to work in accordance with the law in making sure that SPGC manages their developments properly."

The amount agreed upon to be owed to Tarilongi was Vt10 million (10,799,769), which was paid immediately to the claimant.But there was dispute as to when the former director commenced his employment with the Public Service Commission.The Supreme Court says this is now resolved and it is agreed that the severance sum be increased by Vt207,591 to take into account the 15 months longer service from February 2, 1987.It was also agreed that three months of VNPF payments was owed, which amounts to Vt25,401There were two remaining issues.The first related to the section 56(4) of the Employment Act where unjustified termination of employment can result in the employer being ordered to pay severance allowance multiplied by up to a factor of six times.Second is the issue of interest on various payment being sought at 10% per annum.The legal counsel representing the State submitted that the usual Supreme Court rate is 5% per annum.On the first issue, the lawyer representing the Claimant sought the highest multiplication be applied.The mandatory aspect of section 56(4) of the Employment Act is that the Court must make a decision as to whether the severance allowance be multiplied by up to a factor of six times, the Court states that it is not mandatory that the Court must impose the highest multiplier.The claim for a high multiplier effect based on the fact that Mr Tarilongi was a long serving employee, who served the government for 26 years; he was dismissed on the pretext of previously disproved allegations; the State disclosed Tarilongi’s dismissal to the Daily Post and Radio Pacific Island Report, which affected his reputation; the State treated Tarilongi without care; Tarilongi suffered financial in many ways as a result of his wrongful dismissal; Tarilongi’s family suffered stress and anxiety and the former director has been unable to secure new employment.The interest was then fixed at 5% per annum from October 15, 2018 when the assessment of damages was filed in the Supreme Court, as there was no basis to award interest at the highest rate.The Supreme Court arrived at the end result that the severance allowance be multiplied by 3, pursuant to section 56(4) of the Act to take into account special damage occasioned to Mr Tarilongi that is not adequately reflected in the bare severance allowance.The State was ordered to pay Tarilongi Vt207,591 additional severance payment as well as Vt25,401 outstanding VNPF contributions.The severance allowance total is Vt10.7 million plus Vt207,591 is a total of Vt11,007,360. The final figure, which is the sum, multiplied by 3 is Vt33,022,080.Interest on the amount owing, totaling Vt33 million is fixed at 5% per annum from October 15, 2018.A conference has been scheduled by the Supreme Court at 1.30pm on May 7, 2020 to ensure the judgment has been executed or for the judgment debtor to explain how it intends to pay the judgment debt."

AVL apologises to the photographer and the Daily Post.”General Manager (GM) Operations of AVL, Kevin Abel, stated: “Regrettably our staff member got it wrong on the day.“We have apologized and in reviewing the incident identified that there was room for improvement from our side.“We commit to implementing a formal Media Policy, to clarify the situation for our staff, the media and the public, supported by additional training of staff.“We recognize that AVL’s airports are often the location of significant media interest and we are committed to working with the media in future to satisfy the public appetite for news.“We have implemented a procedure whereby we can make images available to the public for publication.”AVL has clarified that there is no restriction on photography in all locations within the terminals and outside the front of the terminals, such as the footpath and car park including the land outside the airport perimeter fence.However, still or video images are not permitted in areas where security screening, customs or immigration operate, or on the apron of the airfield.These policies are global policies mandated by the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) and implemented in Vanuatu under the direction of the Civil Aviation Authority of Vanuatu (CAAV), and the Civil Aviation Act. The primary function of AVL’s airports is to provide facilities for the safe, secure and efficient movement of passengers, staff, freight and aircraft. Airports are secure, restricted environments bound by multiple jurisdictions of agencies operating in the airport, including Customs, Immigration, Quarantine and Police. Specific international security policies and standards apply to airports worldwide, which mean photography is restricted, and in some cases expressly forbidden, in certain areas. AVL assured it is committed to working closely with those wishing to film on airport, either commercial organisations and private persons who wish to use the airport for filming and photography activities. AVL also noted the importance of respecting the privacy of individuals, regardless of location.  Anyone taking still or video images of airport users is requested to be respectful of the privacy of private individuals, those working on airport, and airport operators. AVL’s Media Policy stipulates individuals should not be identifiable unless the photographer has express permission.

This follows a potato seminar he came here to run in September last year.“Those assisting us with this project are Elder Don MacRaild who is involved in assisting PCV with its Prevention for Blindness Project and other Health developments, and Allan Condron — a potato farmer from Victoria who has been assisting PCV with potato-seed trials on Tanna and Efate since 2009 when PCV commenced trials with potato farming.”"
