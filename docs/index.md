# Pacific Observatory

The Pacific Observatory is the World Bank analytical program to explore and develop new information sources to mitigate the impact of data gaps in official statistics for Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Pacific Island Countries (PICs).

This repository hosts the team's efforts to investigate how alternative data sources can be used to generate economic and sector statistics through cost-effective methods. The goal is to assess whether new data sources can produce indicators that are timely, have higher frequency and granularity.

The content is structured by topic of investigation, each thematic folder contains code, notebooks, outputs, and feasibility notes.

Nighttime Lights Applications
^^^

- This note explores socio-economic applications with Night Time Lights data.
- Are lights at night a good proxy for economic activity or extractives?
- Can lights be used to aid poverty mapping, estimate access to electrification, or estimate damages/recovery from natural disasters?

Market Prices Imputation
^^^
- A machine learning imputation method to fill gaps in food prices from markets in Papua New Guinea, which follows the estimation from [here](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/36778).
- The machine learning imputation code is available [here](https://github.com/worldbank/Food-Price-Estimation).
