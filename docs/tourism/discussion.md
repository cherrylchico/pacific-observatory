# Discussion and Conclusion

## Discussion

The employment of aviation data would help estimate tourist arrivals when the official data are lagged or sparse.

**The introduction of exogenous variables, such as the Google Trends index and Covid Stringency Index, proves to be adequate to reflect the tourism situation**. Google Trends index, as auxiliary information, could reflect tourists’ willingness to travel, particularly confirmed by the load factor approach.  

**Combining forecasts from different methods is often better than single forecasts**. Regarding RMSE, linear combinations (relative performance weights) outperform single forecasts and other combination methods three times, and the least squares combination occupies the remaining two times. A detailed look at the weights, especially relative performance ones, reveals the performance of each model. Similarly, for constrained least-square estimation, it reflects each model’s performance over a period.  

Taking Palau as an example, in which relative performance outperforms other models, the load factor’s weights are above 0.55 on average, while constrained least-square estimation is 0.707, suggesting that the load factor is the most critical model for forecasting since 2019.
