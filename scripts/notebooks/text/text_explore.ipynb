      "[' BY ANCILLA ILAVE A GROUP of students at the Legal Training Institute have been told that the most important part of their job is to get the facts right in court. Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika, who opened discussions at a week-long workshop in Port Moresby this week, told the students that getting facts right is important. “Know your facts well to present to the court, and actively participate in discussions,” Sir Gibbs said. He said this during the launch of the workshop on civil and criminal advocacy attended by LTI in collaboration with Australia’s Victorian Bar. The workshop was supported by the Australian Government through the PNG-Australia Partnership. The students were engaged in a range of activities, including interactive sessions and practical courtroom scenarios with accomplished trainers and legal practitioners. The experience provided participants with invaluable insights into case analysis, evidence presentation, effective communication, and persuasive techniques. Those were important because the workshop provided a mock exercise for the law students to experience what actually happens in the court room. ']\n"
